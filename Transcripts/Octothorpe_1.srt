00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:08,420
Hello everyone, welcome to Octothorpe episode 1, a new podcast brought to you by boredom and self-isolation.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,960
I'm John Coxon, I'm a fan from the UK and I am joined by...

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,100
Hi, I'm Alison Scott, I'm also a fan from the UK.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,940
Hello, I'm Liz, I'm also a fan from the UK but I currently live in Thailand.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:36,080
We've decided to do a podcast about fandom from a British perspective and we're going to be talking about a few topics today in a kind of first episode stab at podcasting.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,520
On the morning we record, it's the day after the Eastercon cancelled.

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:51,340
So Eastercon is the British National Science Fiction Convention and Concentric 2020 was to be held in Birmingham this year.

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,040
But it has been cancelled as a result of COVID-19.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,660
Now Alison was the fan guest of honour and I think all three of us are keen Eastercon fans.

10
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,780
How are you guys reacting to the cancellation?

11
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,320
Well, I am, as they say, gutted.

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:17,320
I was obviously hugely looking forward to Eastercon anyway because it was the Eastercon and it's my favourite convention of the whole year.

13
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,520
But also because I was going to be fan guest and I was very much looking forward to that.

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,640
And I had a lot of ideas about fun things we could do.

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,200
And so now I guess we're going to spend our spring doing fun things indoors instead.

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,660
And I'm also, I think, worried because it makes me wonder, will we have an Eastercon next year?

17
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,060
Will we have more conventions?

18
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,220
Is this it for the practice of travelling around the world and meeting our friends?

19
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,360
So I've been assuming it was going to be cancelled for at least two or three weeks.

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:54,700
We were just waiting on the final, you know, legal coverage so that it could be cancelled without the committee being at a huge financial loss.

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,160
I mean, I'm selfishly a little bit glad because I wasn't going to make it this year.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,660
And I really wanted to go in the year that Alison was fan guest of honour because I think it would be hilarious and fun.

23
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,680
May never happen again.

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,220
I like hanging out with Alison because she's such a ray of sunshine.

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,080
I'm assuming that there will be future Eastercons.

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,840
Although, of course, I have, you know, something of a vested interest in global aviation still existing.

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,660
Because I would at some point like to return to the UK and not live the rest of my life in Thailand.

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,260
But that may be a deeper question than the cancellation of Eastercons, I feel.

29
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:46,620
I think Alison's point about whether this will presage the changing of how we do travel and socialising is a really interesting question.

30
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,040
And probably would take longer than we have on this podcast to properly answer.

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:04,400
But one of the things I have seen a lot in my professional capacity as someone who goes to science conferences is people discussing whether or not conferences are still a viable thing to do.

32
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:20,320
But from my perspective, conventions are so much about the social aspect that I kind of feel like after all this has gone away again, we're going to be even more keen to go and see our friends because we're going to have missed out on that for so long.

33
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,920
So do you two think that this will be a portent of the end of conventions?

34
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:34,040
Or do you think it's going to be a reason to continue conventioning with even more vim and vigour?

35
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,500
I think I should clarify that when I said may never happen again, I was referring to my never being guest of honour again.

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:52,820
But I promise to do everything like being guest of honour, like staying up too late and drinking in the bar and meeting everyone at the Eastercon and all of that stuff anyway.

37
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,620
I'm sure we're going to have more conventions.

38
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,280
I'm certain of it.

39
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,860
I think that everyone will be well ready for a convention once we're all vaccinated against this pandemic.

40
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,420
And I'm sure there won't ever be another pandemic.

41
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,260
Isn't that right, Liz?

42
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,720
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

43
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,980
This is this is the only one.

44
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,280
This is never going to happen again.

45
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,780
Viruses, you know, don't jump over from, you know, animals on a regular basis or anything like that.

46
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:27,540
Is this the point where I, you know, inform our listeners that I work on tropical infectious diseases and so I might have a slightly skewed view on global pandemics?

47
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,660
Yeah, I think I think I think of the three of us, you are the one that is most similar to an expert.

48
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,060
So that's probably relevant information.

49
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,540
I think because we've been having conversations about Eastercon up to the cancellation.

50
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:54,840
And I think most people assumed that it would eventually be cancelled once the government announced that mass gatherings and pubs and restaurants were no longer going to be allowed.

51
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,700
It was just a question of when they would do that and therefore when the cancellation would come.

52
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,920
I think to go back to your point earlier, Liz, I was also expecting this to happen.

53
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:14,080
I'm very relieved that the government has come out and taken steps that allow pubs and restaurants and places like that to close.

54
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,300
Because I think until a couple of days ago, that was something that was very difficult for a small business like that to countenance.

55
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,720
And obviously the Hilton being a small business, that's important.

56
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,520
Yes. Yes.

57
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,500
All my sympathies are definitely with the Hilton on this one.

58
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,800
My sympathies rest with the committee and with the management of this hotel.

59
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,300
It's clear that the hotel didn't feel they were in a position to cancel for some time.

60
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,080
And I'm not privileged to any particular information here.

61
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,040
The committee did say, please don't talk about what might happen as if you were a member of the committee.

62
00:05:51,320 --> 00:06:00,580
So I think we could talk about what might happen with absolutely no knowledge whatsoever and making it completely clear we have nothing to do with the committee.

63
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:16,500
And I would like to see us spend part of our Easter weekend getting together, having some online discussion groups and Zoom chats and Zoom parties, which are just like room parties, except with social distancing.

64
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:47,080
With a pun.

65
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,380
Do you think that will be something that gets organised as a grassroots thing?

66
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,740
Or have you seen people start to talk about that?

67
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,900
I've seen people on Twitter starting to discuss it, but nothing concrete yet.

68
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:05,020
I think there's also a feeling that maybe we need to give the committee a few days to kind of process that, yes, the convention is actually cancelled.

69
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,780
All their effort is not going to result in an event.

70
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,440
And to decide whether they're going to have a few days to do something.

71
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,280
And to decide whether they feel like they can redirect that into trying to do something online involving some of what they had planned for the actual event.

72
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Or whether they'd rather sort of hand it over to fandom and say, sorry, we cannot do anything in person this weekend, but we give you our blessing to organise your own social gatherings online.

73
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:37,820
I have one more thought about Eastercon, which is that I'm very glad that in the great game of Pass the Parcel that is running the Eastercon, the parcel didn't land when I was chair.

74
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:44,020
So I have nothing but sympathy for this committee and what they're having to put up with now and deal with.

75
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,420
And I just, all my heart goes out to them, really.

76
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:56,000
I think that as a fandom, we need to give the ConCom the space to do what they want to do.

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,620
If they still see the Easter weekend as something they want to head up and organise, even in an online capacity, then I'm thrilled and I'll be super behind them.

78
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:16,980
But if they are super crushed by the fact that all this has happened and they just want to go and kind of have some time, then I think that's another thing we have to be super supportive of, like in either direction.

79
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,620
Because I can't imagine how stressful the last month must have been for that convention committee.

80
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,540
It must have been awful.

81
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:35,800
Alison, as a former Eastercon chair, can you give us a little bit of an idea of what the Eastercon committee is financially on the hook for every year and the sort of risks that you take when you do commit to running one?

82
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,440
Well, I think that the primary problem here will be twofold.

83
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:53,880
The first is that they will have given a commitment to the hotel that, pending disasters of which this is clearly one, they will have taken a number of rooms in the hotel, quite a large number of rooms.

84
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,160
And then the second thing is that they will have guaranteed a food and drink spend for the hotel.

85
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:10,500
So you say, not only we will bring in soever many people to your hotel this weekend, but also they will eat and drink a lot of food and drink.

86
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,960
And that's how you get the rate on the conference space is by promising to spend a very large amount of money on food and drink.

87
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,120
That will have been considerably more than the cost of the cost of the hotel.

88
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,640
The government mandating that restaurants and bars close was the, I think, final straw.

89
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:39,500
The impression I get from the convention announcement is that the hotel would have been unable to let people eat or drink in the hotel common areas.

90
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:49,920
And so as soon as that happens, you have real trouble with your ability as a hotel to fulfill your contract from that kind of holding a big event perspective.

91
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:58,760
So I think that's why the cancellation happened now, because it was that that meant it became completely unworkable.

92
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:07,680
I can't remember what the typical food and drink spend for an Easter con is, but I know it's usually five figures.

93
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,520
I'd expect them to have a figure for a guarantee for food and drink in the high five figures.

94
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,240
Which is a mad amount of money.

95
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,560
So there's not...

96
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,300
Have you seen how much beer costs?

97
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,700
Yes.

98
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,340
At five pounds a pint, it doesn't take a lot.

99
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,020
That's true.

100
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,700
That's true.

101
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,860
When I was an undergraduate, I used to complain about that very vocally.

102
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,240
Strangely, now I earn more money, I complain less.

103
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
There's no seated Easter con for 2021.

104
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,660
There's not an Easter con constitution.

105
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:46,600
If we've got any US listeners who are used to Robert's Rules of Order and Worcester's Constitutions and all of these things,

106
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:56,860
the Easter con is an anarchic collective of like-minded fans who sort of run conventions by gentleman's agreement as much as by anything else.

107
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,700
And so there's not any provision in any written document for what happens now.

108
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,800
So how do we select the next Easter con and how does all that work?

109
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:17,620
When you say that Easter con is run by a collective of like-minded fans, if enough former chairs of Easter con put their weight behind a proposal that comes forward,

110
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,060
it will just be agreed by a claim.

111
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,720
I just don't think there's a...

112
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,060
I think this is much more of a problem in the minds of rules nerds than it is in practice.

113
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,140
I also don't think people are going to be lining up to run the Easter con.

114
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,400
You know, it would be a problem if you had a lot of contested bids.

115
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:46,280
No, I think it's going to be very difficult for whoever does step up and decide they want to run one next year because they really won't be able to make any concrete plans for quite a while at this point.

116
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,800
They can try and find a hotel, but they can't go and visit a hotel.

117
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,520
They can't really make any commitments to guests or anything like that.

118
00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:01,580
I mean, I think you're probably looking at least the summer, if not early autumn, before we even know if we'll be able to go and have an Easter con next year.

119
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,420
So I think it's going to be a very difficult task.

120
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,340
And frankly, if someone steps up to do it, then I will vote for them wholeheartedly.

121
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:18,180
The most recent analogue is probably the 2007 Easter con, which was held in Chester after the Liverpool Easter con folded.

122
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:27,240
And that, I think, was a case where the convention was organised on about six months' notice, if I recall correctly.

123
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,740
I think convoy folded in the summer and the convention was in March 2007.

124
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,800
And so it can be done.

125
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,800
I don't know whether it will be the size of Easter con you would expect, because obviously Chester was very small for an Easter con.

126
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,680
And it might be that if there's only a six-month lead-up, you do get a hit to attendance.

127
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,220
But last time something even remotely similar to this happened, we still had an Easter con, even if it was a much smaller one.

128
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,520
So I'm hopeful that this is all resolved.

129
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:02,840
And I think Alison's point is right, that this is much more a problem in the minds of rules nerds than it is in real life.

130
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,860
Because if enough people want there to be an Easter con, there'll be an Easter con, regardless of any other considerations.

131
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,440
I think that's true.

132
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:18,480
I mean, I wonder how much of the 2020 Easter con the committee might want to try and roll forward into 2021.

133
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,100
Because presumably there's been a lot of planning done already.

134
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,460
A lot of organisations have been done.

135
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,880
It's possible that some of it can just be sort of jumped forward a year if they wanted to go again for next year.

136
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,440
But I would also understand if they really want to take a break.

137
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:46,220
I think my question would be that we compare this to 2007, but it's not really the same situation as 2007, I think, because, you know, it's a completely different background.

138
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,700
Yeah.

139
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:57,120
But the question is, it seems like Easter con has rolled along as a sort of very loose collective gentleman's agreement, different from year to year, for a long time.

140
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,380
And possibly, actually, it's a ticking time bomb we have been passing along for a while and happens to explode in 2020.

141
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,520
Do you think this will lead to a long term change in how we organise them?

142
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,580
I think this is a great topic for another episode of Octothorpe.

143
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,360
Tune in next time when we talk about Wither Easter con.

144
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,380
I think that is a long discussion and I think it's a good question.

145
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,200
And I think we will come back to it in future episodes.

146
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,680
And we would love our listeners to write in with their thoughts.

147
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:37,220
So on the subject of Easter con being cancelled, on the topic of the fan funds, Michael Lowry, who is this year's TAF delegate, has cancelled his trip.

148
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,480
Unfortunately, TAF, which is the transatlantic fan fund, has enough money in the bank that it can run another trip next year.

149
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,380
And this shouldn't be too much of a problem in the perspective of the fund.

150
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:55,900
But obviously, the other fan funds, such as the Down Under fan fund and the Going Under fan fund, will be affected.

151
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:02,820
And projects like Con or Bust, which gets people of colour to conventions, may also be impacted.

152
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,020
Do you two have any thoughts about how this is going to affect that kind of thing?

153
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,200
Fair, full disclosure, I am one of this year's guff candidates.

154
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:18,520
So I am running to be the fan who goes from Europe to New Zealand for the New Zealand Worldcon.

155
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,020
I think at this point, the New Zealand Worldcon must be in doubt.

156
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,740
July time, I don't see how it's going to happen, but it might do.

157
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:34,080
And I particularly wanted to run this year because it's the first year after my youngest child turned 18.

158
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:42,240
So I can actually go off and party in New Zealand and Australia for weeks on end without having family responsibilities.

159
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,400
But I'd be very happy to run for guff at some future date.

160
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:54,660
The guff has always found it harder to raise money than taff has, just because the expense of a trip is very much greater.

161
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,680
And the number of fans in Australia and New Zealand is slightly smaller.

162
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:09,080
I think guff this year, I think it's going to be cancelled because we won't be sure if there is a Worldcon in time for anyone to seriously plan.

163
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:18,720
And also, I think the finances are so difficult, especially given that there are a lot of teams wanting to run for guff this year,

164
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,440
that it might be reckless to make any kind of concrete reservations that can't be cancelled for full refunds,

165
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,720
because you might just sort of take out all of the guff reserves and then you won't be able to run again.

166
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,080
I also think, speaking as someone, you know, in a country I live in, which I'm not a citizen of,

167
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,860
and where it's obviously becoming increasingly difficult to leave,

168
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,240
I think people might be quite reluctant to go to New Zealand or Australia this year,

169
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,680
because at any point we might have more lockdowns,

170
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,120
and you might find that you can travel there, but may find it very difficult to travel back again.

171
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,240
So for this year, I think it's a non-starter.

172
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,660
In the future, I'd like to see it continue.

173
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,920
It's a huge shame that we're going to miss having a race when there is a Worldcon,

174
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,420
potentially in Australia and New Zealand.

175
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,920
But hopefully it can continue in some form in future years.

176
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,340
I do feel sorry for New Zealand 2020,

177
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:24,720
because even if we completely eradicate the coronavirus before that convention goes ahead,

178
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,400
I can't imagine this is going to do good things to their membership curve.

179
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,660
And as the first Worldcon in New Zealand, I think that is a huge shame.

180
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:40,540
And I think your point about guff running to Australasia is another facet to that being a huge shame.

181
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,860
But I think hopefully we can,

182
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,440
keep the Fannish connections going online.

183
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,100
So should we talk about Consolation?

184
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,880
Are both of you on the Consolation Facebook group?

185
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,760
So I am, but I'm not really reading it.

186
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,480
That's fair.

187
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,040
Because I had the look.

188
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,540
And I don't know,

189
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,800
I think I must have just been in completely the wrong frame of mind.

190
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,940
But I didn't find it very funny.

191
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,680
It started off quite funny,

192
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,220
because it was all full of conrunners.

193
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,760
And conrunners,

194
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,180
the group of people are on like Journeymen of Fandom,

195
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,480
which is the primary Facebook conrunning group,

196
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,320
have a certain mindset.

197
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,820
And they have a lot in common with each other,

198
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,640
even if the sorts of conventions they're running are very different.

199
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,300
But now Consolation has bloomed to about 20,000 people.

200
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,520
And a lot of those people aren't,

201
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,040
they don't share the same context and experiences as,

202
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,460
say,

203
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,700
Eastercon fans do.

204
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:44,980
I mean,

205
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,800
there's a reason why we're saying this is a podcast from a British fan,

206
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,320
fanish point of view,

207
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,540
that we know that the people that we are speaking to are going to have much of

208
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,540
the same interests and influences as we do.

209
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,380
Consolation is now beyond that point.

210
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,780
It's covering a lot of different fandoms,

211
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,300
not all of which are my fandom.

212
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,300
I still find it's got some quite funny things in it from time to time.

213
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,020
It's an incredibly difficult thing to balance when you get to 20,000 people.

214
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,060
You can't all share a sensibility.

215
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,660
And in a venue like,

216
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,200
well,

217
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,660
in a real convention where you can have different programming streams and

218
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,720
different rooms and different corners of the bar,

219
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,000
that works fine because not everyone has to share a sensibility.

220
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,820
But a Facebook group with no separate channels and no kind of different

221
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,540
corners can't replicate that.

222
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,040
Well,

223
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,360
I will say the last few posts on that group from my perspective have been from

224
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,320
British comrunners.

225
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,240
So I have been appreciating those quite a lot,

226
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,100
but I don't know.

227
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,220
I don't know what the main oeuvre is.

228
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,900
I mean,

229
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,000
it's at times like this,

230
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,220
I really miss LiveJournal.

231
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,980
I know LiveJournal is still there,

232
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,760
but in terms of its fanish presence,

233
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,500
it hasn't been for years and years now,

234
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,920
but the communities and the different people's blogs were a very good way of

235
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,580
emulating that kind of series of corners.

236
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,160
Facebook just doesn't seem to do quite the same things.

237
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,780
I think that's going to be a problem for any attempts to kind of have

238
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,260
fanish activity online while we can't have face-to-face conventions.

239
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,500
Seems like Facebook is not really the best space for it.

240
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,180
Just because you can't scale to that many people.

241
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,800
And also it's so hard to see what's new,

242
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,720
what you've read,

243
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,760
what you've already seen before,

244
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,820
but someone's posted lol again.

245
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,000
And so it's popped up to the back,

246
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,360
you know,

247
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,520
the top of your feed again.

248
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,020
I think it was obviously a great thing to start at the time,

249
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,620
but I think it's going to be a useful lesson in how we do and don't run these

250
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,860
things over the next,

251
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,360
you know,

252
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,600
six to 12 months while we can't have face-to-face meetings of any kind.

253
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,060
And I know a lot of fanish activity happens over on Twitter as well,

254
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,900
but I think Twitter falls into a lot of the same problems where if you,

255
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,640
if you follow mostly people in fandom,

256
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,160
you can replicate that kind of fanish experience.

257
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,580
But if you've got quite a varied Twitter timeline,

258
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,940
it doesn't do a good job of clumping everything together into coherent structures,

259
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,600
as it were.

260
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,520
I also,

261
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,280
I really value longer form writing.

262
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,000
And although you can do this on Facebook to some extent,

263
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,120
and you get quite good feedback.

264
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,540
Don't get me wrong when you write in a longer form.

265
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:39,980
It's not the same as fanzines or even the longer form writing on LiveJournal.

266
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,400
And Twitter is really hopeless for this,

267
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,960
even though there's this whole,

268
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,760
I am now going to write a thread,

269
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,400
one of 48.

270
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,520
I think a lot of the efforts to do long form writing on Twitter are

271
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,240
putting a plaster over some pretty big hurdles.

272
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,060
And I guess the sites like Tumblr are not widely adopted enough.

273
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,640
Well,

274
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,060
that's not true of,

275
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,460
of many fandoms,

276
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,880
but certainly the kind of Easter Kong going fandom has never coalesced around

277
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,080
Tumblr in the same way it did around LiveJournal.

278
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,020
And so I think,

279
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,460
I think you're right that the difficulty of doing long form discussions,

280
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,240
especially on Twitter,

281
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
but on Facebook as well,

282
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,340
is a real,

283
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,900
problem.

284
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:30,060
And I am wondering whether this will encourage fandom to discover better venues for that kind

285
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,580
of interaction than we currently have.

286
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,280
But I don't,

287
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,240
I don't know because I don't know what options there are and how easy those venues are to find.

288
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,500
I would say that Tumblr also is quite difficult for this kind of interaction.

289
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,000
discussion.

290
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,940
Not because you can't post quite long posts,

291
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,180
but the only way to really interact is to sort of repost it with your own comments on.

292
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,980
And then the discussion just forks into a million different pathways and you can never follow them all.

293
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,980
I think it's a good broadcast medium,

294
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,300
I think it's a good broadcast medium,

295
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,000
but not a good conversational one.

296
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,720
So I think that the choice is going to be,

297
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,020
do we find a medium which is better suited to how we want to communicate?

298
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,880
Or do we continue sort of bobging communication in the platforms that people are already on,

299
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,460
even though it doesn't work that well?

300
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,720
But I guess in the early days,

301
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,820
Twitter didn't even have at replies and hashtags.

302
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,120
People sort of came up with those on the fly and got them incorporated into the system.

303
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,720
So maybe someone will come up with a much better way of doing things on the platforms we already have.

304
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,160
That is true.

305
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,320
And I should say there are many people who do use Facebook and Twitter to engage in an awful lot of fan activity.

306
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,780
And I suppose it's entirely possible we will get letters of comments from those people

307
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,200
criticising our take, because I am aware that I'm on Twitter,

308
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,360
but I'm nowhere near as engaged as some of the people on my timeline are.

309
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,900
And the same with Facebook.

310
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,360
I think you Facebook a lot more than me, Alison, especially in terms of long form writing.

311
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,200
We're about to move on to how to keep sane during an apocalypse.

312
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,280
I think I may have noticed we were going to have an apocalypse slightly before average.

313
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,740
And I started doing a lot of things around self-care.

314
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:15,020
I'm a very atheist person, but I think spiritual self-care is incredibly important for people,

315
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,360
which is hard if you believe that we're all basically animals who will

316
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
go into the dust.

317
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,960
So I've been doing a lot of meditating and a lot of journaling.

318
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,300
And a lot of that then becomes journaling on Facebook,

319
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,520
because I write things that I can then share to a public audience or a near public audience.

320
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:46,040
Yeah, because you've been trying to whittle away all of your earthly possessions or at the very least carefully examining what earthly possessions you need.

321
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,280
Yeah, that's just gone so wrong.

322
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,240
I've just bought a pair of Joy-Cons.

323
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,040
But that's staying sane in the apocalypse.

324
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,340
That seems entirely fair to me.

325
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:02,800
Maybe this is why this does not work well for my personality type, which is more things love things.

326
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,400
And I ask what Joy-Cons are because they sound quite like a sex toy.

327
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,940
Switch controllers.

328
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,740
They are a sex toy.

329
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,880
They're the things that fit onto your Switch.

330
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:20,360
Two days ago, Nintendo released Animal Crossing New Horizons, which is the video game for our time.

331
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:29,920
You and your friends can build a lovely island paradise where you pick fruit, go for long walks,

332
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,080
do not observe social distancing conventions.

333
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,960
I started to play it using my son's Switch and I was like, but this is hopeless.

334
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,180
And he said, this is Joy-Con drift, which is a thing, apparently.

335
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,920
And I was like, but your joysticks don't work.

336
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,000
And he was like, no, I need new ones, but I can't afford £62.99.

337
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,020
So to stay sane, you have bought Switch controllers.

338
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:59,420
And Liz, you have purchased a PlayStation 4 and acquired a much larger television.

339
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,100
Yes, I should say it was actually coincidental that my television, which is in my rented flat,

340
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,840
and so I don't own it, basically went tits up at the same time I bought a PlayStation

341
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,360
and it got instantly replaced with one about twice the size.

342
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,900
It was quite fortuitous, really.

343
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,300
I think it's about 55 inches.

344
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,060
Title of my sex tape, obviously.

345
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,360
Family show, Liz.

346
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,240
Family show.

347
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,960
And that is what, as mathematicians call, exponential growth.

348
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,980
No, I think it would greatly enrich my life where I spend most of it, you know,

349
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,200
sitting in between the same four walls.

350
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,240
Because, I don't know, the fact that people are almost people-sized on it seems to make

351
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,880
a huge difference.

352
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,580
I hadn't thought of that, but that is interesting.

353
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,980
If you buy a television large enough to have people-sized people on it,

354
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,040
does that make you subconsciously feel less lonely?

355
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,840
I don't know.

356
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,120
When my daughter started at university, we got into the habit of just leaving Skype video

357
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,960
on for hours on end.

358
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,600
And I thought about the future.

359
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,440
This is back when I thought that the future would be good.

360
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,340
And I assumed we'd all have, essentially, video walls.

361
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:17,460
And you'd just set up permanent video links to all of the people that you care about on your video wall.

362
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,220
I should say we have been in lockdown for about 24 hours here.

363
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,400
So I'm not quite as starved as human contact as I will be in 12 weeks' time.

364
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,260
That's fair.

365
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:31,080
My work advised us to work from home from Monday just gone.

366
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,780
So I'm at the end of my first week of lockdown.

367
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,040
And I don't know how long you've been locked down for, Alison, at the moment.

368
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,780
I've been working from home for about four years.

369
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,720
But my family are also working from home.

370
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,840
And my house turns out to be quite small if everyone's trying to work from home in it at once.

371
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,540
That's a real problem for us.

372
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,720
So my week has been about having much more human contact than normal.

373
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,360
We're still also walking out every day at the moment.

374
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,420
We can go to parks.

375
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,360
We can go anywhere.

376
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,040
But that, I think, isn't...

377
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,840
By next Friday, that'll have stopped, I'm sure.

378
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:18,540
I stopped doing main social interaction from Wednesday last week because it was obvious that it was going to be necessary.

379
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,740
Yeah, that's fair.

380
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,300
This is very depressing, John.

381
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,380
We need less depressing death stuff in our podcast and more jokes.

382
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,280
That's fair.

383
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,140
That works.

384
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,000
Lots of people are putting entertainment online.

385
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,240
Yes, yes.

386
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,580
So lots of games are free.

387
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,500
The Metropolitan Opera and the Royal Opera House have an opera every night.

388
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,620
You can go and stream.

389
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,320
There's loads of television.

390
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,080
I'm already in television bankruptcy.

391
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,800
So Disney Plus launches in two days' time in the UK.

392
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,500
There's a lot launch in two days' time for the Asia region.

393
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,200
I'm very grumpy about that.

394
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
How long do you have to wait?

395
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,860
We don't have a firm day.

396
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
I think they said spring 2021.

397
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,360
Or maybe it was pulled forward to autumn 2020.

398
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:10,280
Maybe they will pull it forward now all the theme parks are closed and no one's going to the cinema because that will get them more cash.

399
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,840
But we'll have to wait and see.

400
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,120
All of the streaming services are reducing bandwidth.

401
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,760
So they're reducing quality on the service, which seems fine to me.

402
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,280
Because you're about to have a huge uptick in the amount of streaming.

403
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,540
So that, I think, makes a lot of sense.

404
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,080
I'm also a child of the video age.

405
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,440
I remember VHS.

406
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,540
I remember long play recording on VHS.

407
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,800
I remember long play recording on VHS, Alison.

408
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,420
It's not that ancient.

409
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,060
Yeah.

410
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,860
So the quality was not that good, but we coped, right?

411
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,940
We did cope.

412
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,360
But I also remember BitTorrenting TV in the smallest possible files.

413
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,400
Actually, not BitTorrent.

414
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,820
Probably before BitTorrent.

415
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,720
Downloading TV in the smallest possible files so that I could get away with them on my band.

416
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,860
And, you know, we just live with it.

417
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,320
Okay, boomers.

418
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,800
These people today.

419
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,500
Obviously, I have never BitTorrented or downloaded anything.

420
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,440
I have no idea at all what you're talking about, obviously.

421
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,720
This is a golden opportunity to catch up with all of the TV shows that I have been lacking.

422
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:26,540
I'm approaching the season three finale of Buffy, which gives you an idea of how behind I am.

423
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,900
And I've also been playing a lot of board games.

424
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:35,020
A bunch of print and play board games have been made available for free online.

425
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:44,340
I contributed to a GoFundMe for a gaming podcast I listen to who has some contributors who are struggling to stay afloat at the moment.

426
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,820
And they've been giving free games to people who donate.

427
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,700
And so I put a couple of links in the show notes to a couple of free games I've been thoroughly enjoying over the last few days.

428
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:03,700
And I also spent most of this weekend playing the DLC for Horizon Zero Dawn on PS4, which I had not yet got round to.

429
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,760
And I am thoroughly enjoying it.

430
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,860
Have you started playing your PlayStation yet, Liz?

431
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,600
I have.

432
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:19,200
It came with a free copy of The Last of Us, which obviously is a near future dystopia after a pandemic has taken hold.

433
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,880
And then as a change from that, I got a game with no shooting involved.

434
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:33,720
So I bought Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, which is a game about wandering around a Shropshire village in the 1980s after everyone has been raptured in some way.

435
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,980
And they've closed all the roads because they're saying it was a flu pandemic.

436
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,540
So I picked really the worst possible games to start my PS4 gaming experience with.

437
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,540
I've got to try something more jolly for next week.

438
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,340
So obviously reading's also an option.

439
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:55,700
And I'm currently reading The Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe, which turns out to be very...

440
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,940
It has a lot of messages for our times.

441
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,560
Is everyone buying toilet paper in Thailand, Liz?

442
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,600
So not so far.

443
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,240
I mean, there were stacks and stacks of it when I went to the shops today, but also my supermarket has not been hit by shortages.

444
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,360
Really, the buying has just started because they've closed all the restaurants as of this weekend.

445
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,120
But also, I've got a bidet sprayer.

446
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,000
And every toilet in Thailand has a bidet sprayer.

447
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,280
Are you aware of these?

448
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,120
Do you want to describe them for the listeners who aren't?

449
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:32,020
So the best description I've heard of these is that your toilet pees back.

450
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:44,000
So it's not a bidet seat, but basically it's just like a sort of shower spray gun on a hose with the idea being that you can wash things up a bit.

451
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,980
And then usually wipe and so on.

452
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,780
But in an emergency, you'd probably be okay.

453
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:55,580
So that may be behind the lack of panic buying of Lurol so far.

454
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,760
I'll keep you updated on the Lurol status as we go along.

455
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,860
Thank you very much.

456
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,840
So on the subject of books, I am reading The Laundry Files by Charlie Strauss.

457
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:17,180
I'm reading the most recent, I think, which takes place in a UK after the government has been supplanted by a literal elder one.

458
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,700
So it's not quite as relevant as the reading material you two are reading.

459
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,980
But it's still not a barrel of laughs.

460
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,100
I'm also not sure whether I'm going to be able to return it to the library anytime soon because it is now overdue.

461
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,420
My library has automatically extended return dates till the end of April.

462
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,640
So you should check.

463
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,940
Oh, that's really good.

464
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:46,880
From the library, I have the audio book of Hilary Mantel's The Mirror and the Light, all 78 hours of it.

465
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,460
So that's keeping me busy.

466
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:57,220
And also from the library, I have Europe in Autumn by Dave Hutcherson, which apparently there was a pandemic in that one as well.

467
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,280
But people have been recommending the Europe books to me for years.

468
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,180
So I'm quite pleased to finally be getting to read them.

469
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:10,320
I have bought a book on the great flu pandemic of 1918, but I have not brought myself to start that one yet.

470
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,340
And maybe I shouldn't while I am, you know, home alone.

471
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,060
I might stick to more cheery reading.

472
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:21,540
Instead, I'm reading Barefaced Messiah, which is the biography of L. Ron Hubbard.

473
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,820
Oh, OK.

474
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:28,460
Which I believe got its author followed about by Scientology for many, many years.

475
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,980
I have no opinions on Scientology while I'm on this podcast.

476
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:38,220
I also have no opinions on Scientology and no opinions on obviously bit torrenting.

477
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,300
I just have strong feelings on bidet sprayers.

478
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,820
I have just checked and my library has extended my book reservation.

479
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,640
I can exclusively reveal I am reading the Labyrinth Index.

480
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,580
And yes, I have until the 17th of June to read it now.

481
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,880
So they've extended that by three months.

482
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,720
Hopefully that is pessimistic, but we shall see.

483
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,260
I am very lucky my local library does a very good genre selection.

484
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,320
I was able to borrow some of the Hugo finalists last year.

485
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:17,400
So just before we wrap up, what would you say your one top tip for surviving the apocalypse is?

486
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,740
I don't know yet.

487
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,980
Honestly, I think I need more time in isolation to develop those habits.

488
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:32,040
I have started doing online YouTube workouts in which a cheery guy tells me, you know, to push it to the max and we're going to push through this.

489
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,560
And it's every every workout is a step towards your goal.

490
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,820
And it turns out I quite like that at this point in time.

491
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:54,760
I mean, at the moment, my my life is very much I think if you do live with other people, make spending time working out how you're going to share your space differently, I think is going to be very key to staying sane and has been a very big part of our week.

492
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,580
Yeah.

493
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:02,600
While I can, I'm getting out every day because I'm fairly sure I will not be able to get out every day in another week or so.

494
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm thinking of taking up gardening.

495
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,660
How can what sort of world are we in where things like walks and gardening and jigsaws seem like sensible uses of anyone's time?

496
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:23,020
My wife has, in fact, mostly been gardening and doing jigsaw puzzles, both of which are activities she loves.

497
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,980
So she has been very happy.

498
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:33,000
I do think the siloing of personal space and being very strict about that has helped me in Espanya a lot over the last week.

499
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,860
So that brings us to the end of the first episode of the Octothor podcast.

500
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,880
Thank you very much for listening to episode one.

501
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,880
I think the lifeblood of a podcast is the interaction with our listeners.

502
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,680
And obviously, we don't actually have any listeners.

503
00:36:47,680 --> 00:37:00,380
So if you're listening to this, we really want you to know what you think of the podcast and what we should be doing better and what you think about the topics we've covered and what topics we ought to be covering next time.

504
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:06,480
And, you know, get in at the ground floor before we become a big deal and we won't pay any attention to your feedback.

505
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,580
Obviously, now is the best time to send us a letter.

506
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,920
No, cut that.

507
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,760
That's a lie.

508
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,800
Oh, and if you're interested in sponsoring the podcast, we have sponsorship slots, right?

509
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,480
Oh, wow.

510
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,200
Okay.

511
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,580
Yeah.

512
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:31,180
So we're super keen to hear what people think, what people think we could do better, what people think about the topics we've covered, what people think we're doing well.

513
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,440
So please send us letters and clips of comment.

514
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,060
That brings us to the end of episode one of the Octothorpe podcast.

515
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,580
I'd like to thank my co-hosts, Liz Batty and Alison Scott for joining me.

516
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:49,660
If you'd like to send letters or clips of comment to us, please email octothorpecast at gmail.com.

517
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,460
If you'd like to tweet about us or use other social media, then hashtag octothorpecast.

518
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,580
And we will see you in episode two.

519
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,080
So for now, it's bye from me.

520
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,640
And it's goodbye from me.

521
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,180
And it's goodbye from me.

522
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,460
Nailed it.
