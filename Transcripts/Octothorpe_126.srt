1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 that fair yeah although i did like your eyes and joke well but then alison sort of made a face so i

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,240
 thought maybe i should not make it on the redo i'll make a face with lots of things and you still

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:22,720
 say it jump well 100%

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,760
 hello everyone and welcome to the very 126th episode of Octothorpe a podcast for science fiction

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,440
 and science fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 16th of january 2025 i'm john coxin

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,840
 i'm elison scott and i'm liz batty and alison and i haven't changed microphones it's just that we're

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,880
 both ill i'm definitely getting better because if you because you live you live in the land of

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,880
 gold and blakes everything is terrible i mean it will get warmer one day i think yes in my case

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,280
 tomorrow where it will be 10 instead of minus one yeah they've been saying that for a little while

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,680
 though so hopefully it will be warm tomorrow and everything and all the ice will melt and i will

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,080
 start feeling better happy new year everyone yes happy new year and we have some letters of

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:24,960
 comments uh jonathan kawi wrote in uh jonathan wrote a very long and eloquent lock about how

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,000
 annoyed he was that glasgo didn't mail out souvenir books to supporting members and he points out

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,560
 that the constitution and the matters of continuing effect mandate that this be done i'm gonna say

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,280
 i'm gonna say a couple of things here firstly i apologize very much jonathan because i don't know

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,800
 that you know this but as the long con three deputy division head for publications it was me who first

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,480
 disobeyed the wussford's constitution by refusing to do a physical copy of progress report four and

18
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,640
 therefore i may not be the sympathetic shoulder you hoped your words would find in this email uh

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,640
 because i pretty much entirely sympathize with glasgo's perspective here i think there is a reason

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,240
 glasgo did that and i think it's because most people probably think it's fine we do it and then do

21
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,480
 we want to do mike scott and every time we say mike scott can we pronounce it great scott

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,800
 in the style of doc brown it's mike scott doctor scott is the doctor no okay

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:33,360
 asked and answered rocky horror reference sorry oh but i thought maybe he was a doctor and i just

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,200
 did not know that mike has written rather pedantically and and as well as being known as doctor plottary

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,200
 was also known as captain pedantic for a while so you know and this is why to say that maltham

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,920
 stow is not remotely in central under which i think is what i said really um and that it is

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,680
 quicker to get to central London from excel than it is from maltham stow because there's now an

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,360
 Elizabeth line station on the excel uh erstec cell which i didn't know he then says that the journey

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,960
 time on the dlr from custom has to tower gateway was basically the same as um the victoria line for

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,040
 both of social central to uster which might be true but on the other hand used as much

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,840
 closer to the central London tower gateway is by almost any standard but never mind and he does

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,360
 point out that he has some credentials in this area because he maintains it spent many years

33
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,520
 maintaining a database of all the locations in which people might want to search for houses

34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,400
 and who experimented with having public transport journey times as a search criterion

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,360
 but did not succeed in that you probably could do it now because the public transport journey

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
 times are much more a matter of record than they used to be anyway thank you michael i would like

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,120
 to say that this was an unsuccessful reference to a lot who received from claire bryley of croydon

38
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,920
 in episode 15 in which she said and i quote i haven't been to allyson's not very big house only the

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,920
 five bedroom one in inner london now this opens up the question is the word inner an exact synonym

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,520
 for the words central and i guess not no one of the bits i've just cut out of it said

41
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,120
 walthamstone not even in a london which is much bigger than central london i think claire bryley

42
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,000
 mike scott might have to have a panel item discussing the exact nature of london's geography

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,440
 well i mean croydon smiles out i think we could all agree on that none none of this is none of this

44
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:34,000
 is disproving the notion that fandom may be you know overly centered on london is fandom more or

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,280
 less centered on london that is uk fandom more or less centered on london the uk population

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,440
 discuss oh no i'm not saying it's not a bad thing for the whole uk yeah i agree with liz i mean i

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,680
 was thinking this came up a while ago it years ago i'm sure this came up in the context of the bsf a

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,280
 running like a pub meeting in london and not anywhere else and i think there were efforts to run pub

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,560
 meets elsewhere which may still be ongoing whereas john is actively contributing to the decentralization

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:09,760
 of uk fandom by having his own pub meet in your castle with like gregs and parmos yeah i had a

51
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:17,040
 parmow to ring in the new year liz it was great thank you for it again mike we also heard from

52
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,200
 well not quite from our regular correspondent chris vajay arsea but from our

53
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,160
 infrequent correspondent bella who centers a waffle of comment which we will put in the show notes

54
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,720
 it's a waffle in the shape of an octop it is very much appreciated i'm very excited by this

55
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,000
 and hashtag waffle thought yes i thought this might be our first food of comment but then i

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,480
 realized that was the whole weetabix thing so probably not yes given alice and sent me a

57
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,680
 weetabix globe yes yeah we still got the weetabix is still fine yeah i've not had to break the

58
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,000
 classroom urgency yet well i thought the humidity might get to it but it is actually fine yeah i

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,960
 thought the mice might get to mind but it does indeed still seem to be fine lizards seem uninterested

60
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:09,520
 in weetabix and can you blame them silly lizards niel ottenstein wrote in to ask how my science

61
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:17,200
 conference went post-covid much the same as it did pre-covid it is not much different yeah

62
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,600
 basically i did not get ill but i did use lizards magic spray every day so that probably helped

63
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,680
 so we also got some discussion on facebook on the post-burda last episode i'm not gonna read

64
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,640
 it all you can go and have a look what we did here from tami coxin who is one of the people

65
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,080
 behind the proposal for a 2027 european smofcon somewhere sunny along with i think some of the

66
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,800
 european con runners so if anyone's picky interested in helping with that you can contact tami

67
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,280
 there's also some discussion of the virtual business meeting and the fact that last year's

68
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,480
 business meeting set up a committee to look at the rules by how we run the business meeting

69
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,520
 and it is in a way a little bit weird that we have a committee running on that

70
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,880
 while at the same time this current year's world conner just like yeah we're going to do

71
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,840
 in a different way but i think the problem is that because the cycle for committees is so long

72
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,360
 you know you have a committee they will hopefully report back next year but some of them

73
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,360
 actually don't manage report that that year and report back another year after and then if

74
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,680
 they're reporting back at the con you can't actually introduce any proposals based on that

75
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,320
 until the next con usually like the cycle is too long i think and i can understand why people

76
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,840
 like no we're going to actually have a go at changing things now the other thing is that if

77
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,960
 your committees have not actually got themselves into action yet which is understandable because

78
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,400
 they're going to be a pause post gone when everyone's a bit tired and then you might think oh there's

79
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,760
 no point starting it like in december let's kick it off with a new year the fact that the

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,120
 business meetings are now starting in july means you have a shrunk window of time to actually get

81
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,320
 anything done them's me thoughts i think that's all fair i agree with Liz yeah no that's all

82
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,960
 sounded perfectly sensible to me on the subject of online business meetings far out notes that

83
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,560
 they don't know whether high-level con runners actively want an online business meeting which

84
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,280
 something we discussed last time but they do note that a lot of people who attend the business

85
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,520
 meeting have told con runners basically well if you care you come to the business meeting and you

86
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,640
 don't so clearly you don't and i think that's the other thing which is if you have been in a situation

87
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,200
 where you've been told you don't you know the reason you don't come to the business meeting is

88
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,160
 simply that you don't care enough you are quite annoyed at the way the business meeting is constituted

89
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,680
 and you do want to change it and i think that is a example of con sort of actions having consequences

90
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,080
 like you don't get to gatekeep and then obviously gatekeep and then be annoyed when the people you're

91
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,400
 keeping the gate from start mounting at your gate because that will happen and typically speaking

92
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,080
 if you're the one behind the gatekeeping it shut you are not on the right side of that debate like

93
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,200
 there's very few examples i can think of where the gatekeepers were lauded years later as being on

94
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,320
 the right side of things so that is i think also food for thought we got any more bits to add to

95
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,400
 your gate metaphor because it's stacking up it's good there's a stacking gate it's more like a

96
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,000
 style at this point in terms of gatekeeping christmas movies uh we heard from multiple

97
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,240
 commentators that diehard is not a christmas movie we didn't say it was a christmas movie

98
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,480
 uh but also that the muppet christmas carol is very good i watched it with the song in it makes way

99
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,720
 wasn't for the song in i don't understand how how anyone could watch it without the song in i have

100
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,040
 very strong opinions very quickly we watched it without the sogging because we had not paid

101
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,560
 close enough attention and then we went back and watched the song and went oh that makes quite a

102
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,640
 lot more sense but of course we knew the story um i i thought it was okay because the thing about

103
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,960
 it is that it's a christmas movie and i clearly don't like them very much and also it's dickens and

104
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,600
 i really don't like dickens and then i went oh but i like that david copperfield and that was the one

105
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
 that was scripted by amanda in an inuchu which is why i liked it probably because normally i

106
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,360
 really don't like dickens apart from that i do like muppets a whole lot so the muppet bits are

107
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,880
 quite good but it's never going to be a kind of classic for us we all kind of got to the end and

108
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,520
 went eh meh so i just wanted to do a dissenting a dissenting opinion on that we did see wallace

109
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,000
 and crobert and we thought that was pretty good i liked muppet christmas carol a great deal i think

110
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,800
 probably yes you are right if you know the story the um the the lack of the song probably doesn't like

111
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 it's not as important as it might be but no i really liked it i thought it was good i thought

112
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:30,000
 michael canes was very good and then we heard from raj on mr don who says he'll definitely say hello

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,080
 at reconnective he can find us we'll be on the alt-to-thawp paddle raj and we'll probably also be at the

114
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,160
 bar but there will be at least one place we will be very easy to spot uh and then he also says cons

115
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,320
 out with glasco the thing is he's a very lazy person and it's so much easier he can just stay at

116
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
 home and still attend the con which is fair but does beg the question are you commuting

117
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,680
 glasco to Belfast every day raj right in i suspect the answer is no but it amused me to think that he

118
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,200
 might be we heard from andres devore who wrote in say it was interesting to hear details about

119
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,560
 east con budgets and con costs glad you found it interesting andres and also said they might

120
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
 seriously consider some international cons with virtual memberships and ask us to keep pushing

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,040
 the idea and i'm sure we will continue to talk about virtual memberships we also heard from

122
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:23,440
 june young thank you for the festive greetings june uh june does ask did jon ever do a panel at

123
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,480
 dublin con in 2019 if he did i think i spoke to him afterwards a panel about tv shows failed on

124
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,760
 the ending jon was that you could well have been it is the sort of panel i probably would have

125
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,320
 said i would be quite good on do you remember someone having very negative opinions about

126
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,040
 balsar glad to cuz ending because if so that could have been me the other thing is if you

127
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,960
 remember someone who was being very contrary about the ending of game of thrones that could

128
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,360
 also have been me i mean when we say contrary do you mean that you liked the ending of game of thrones

129
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,640
 i yeah i don't really see how it could have ended any differently i think they rushed it because

130
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,960
 they were told to rush it but i think it was clearly the ending that um george alway's intended to

131
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,000
 write yeah i can sort of see that having a few extra episodes in there would have probably been

132
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,200
 better for the show but dennaris is clearly set up to be terrible the whole way through and the

133
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,680
 fact that emilia clark is very charismatic i don't think undercuts that and so i was a bit

134
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,440
 surprised when everyone was very shocked that she turned out to be terrible which i know is

135
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,840
 something if you're in a more also writes in her management book on game of thrones which i

136
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,320
 highly recommend everyone to go read beer and i think part of the reason george alway's in is

137
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,800
 ground to even more of a stop might be that that was exactly where he was heading and now he knows

138
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,560
 everyone hates it so i don't know but that's my contrary opinion so june if you remember someone

139
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,720
 with that contrary opinion that might have been me we heard from consanza on discord because you

140
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,760
 couldn't find the facebook post which is fair it's hard to find anything on facebook um saying that

141
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,560
 to participate in seattle's virtual business meeting you need an attending membership or a

142
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,560
 virtual attending membership so you cannot participate if you are a supporting member i guess we don't

143
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,360
 call them supporting memberships anymore do we call them wispless memberships sorry so basically

144
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,080
 you now buy a wisvers membership which does not enable you to take part in the business of wisless

145
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:25,360
 we call the wispless members which is it's an odd one i think i would rather you didn't have to

146
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,800
 but i can sort of see the logic it would be really hard to gate just the business meeting yeah i

147
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,560
 can see it's also i think it'd be interesting to see does anyone can't do people buy virtual

148
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,720
 memberships just to attend the business meeting i might i don't think i have a full membership for

149
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,160
 seattle so i should not think i have any membership for seattle okay rambling now but i should probably

150
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,080
 buy a membership for seattle so don't i there is some worry about like okay if everyone come to

151
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,240
 the business meeting then the business meeting is very susceptible to bad actors and you keep the

152
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,480
 cost a little bit higher and that keeps them out but it is still keeping up people who can't afford

153
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,880
 to do the extra thirty five dollars yeah it's this is the sort of very difficult conversation i think

154
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,120
 we sort of got into this a little bit last time you do want to keep enough of a gate that you

155
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,400
 discourage the bad actors and it's not clear how you do that the price of supporting membership is

156
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,040
 artificially constrained for the worldcon but my general view is that the supporting membership

157
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,600
 and the membership that gets you all the virtual should be the same because i think it solves a lot

158
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:37,120
 of those problems but then it would also be more in this case so we have a we have a taf race

159
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,400
 which is open and you can vote now and we will put the link in the show notes there are three

160
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:51,920
 candidates who are z graves mikleiko lasky and jan vanich jr junior and they all have their

161
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,560
 platforms online and you can go and vote for them so i think it's quite great to have a

162
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,760
 taf race with three candidates that's quite good we do not yet have a guff race um for reasons but

163
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:11,760
 hopefully that's becoming along quite soon and um in other news the Canadian unity fan fund has

164
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,280
 given up so this is a fan fund that exists to send Canadians to other Canadian

165
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,120
 conventions and they can't find anyone to run and they're having trouble getting conventions to host

166
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,640
 um so the the administrator has announced that he thinks it might be time to give up the ghost

167
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,160
 which i think is a shame because i always liked the fan funds that sought to increase the

168
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,480
 conversation between people in like a country i always thought that was a really good idea and

169
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,200
 so i think it's a bit of a shame that that has uh that that has wrapped up um or that it looks like

170
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,320
 it might wrap up i mean so first i didn't know this fan fund existed it sounds quite fun when you

171
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,400
 are a giant country with not that many people in i do think sometimes the best way to get people

172
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,240
 to step up to run things is to say we're gonna fold and then the people who are like oh really do

173
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,400
 i want it to fold might appear it's not always means you're going to keep going for a long time but

174
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,080
 it could be a good way to didn't work for the dovers no it doesn't always work but it is a way to get

175
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,320
 people to think about like okay seriously we do need to step up and do something otherwise this

176
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,680
 is going to fold do i want to do this work more than i want the whole thing to fold there's not

177
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,800
 like an inter-us one is that they're like nothing that sends people like from the east coast to the

178
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,520
 west coast or vice versa no there really should be a fan fund called nath

179
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,760
 the north american fan fund but and yet there is not i always thought i think the european fan funds

180
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,880
 a very good idea and i would like to see i would i thought i think that is very good and i hope that

181
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,640
 that does not go the same way as cuff um and i think there's also you know i i do i think this is

182
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,320
 a sort of thing that's very very good and i think it would be nice to see cuff kind of come out of the

183
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,840
 ashes reborn but um i don't know whether that will happen don't know enough about the canadian

184
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,160
 scene really canadians right in yes

185
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:15,680
 a nice thing happened this week which is an esteemed member of north american universities

186
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,320
 world leading solar and space physics research group has been recognized by the royal astronomical

187
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,240
 society and received the fan award uh and that esteemed member of uh north american university is

188
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,440
 dr john coxant so well done john thanks liz and we'll put a link to the press release and i guess

189
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,960
 the fowler award is an award for early career scientists in geophysics is that right john

190
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,920
 that is correct we're going to put a link to press release so that i don't have to explain

191
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,240
 what john's day job is but we know he's professor of aurora science at north umbria

192
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,880
 space stuff dunder space stuff and it's very cool i'm not a professor i'm only a doctor professor

193
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,040
 the boy john coxant nobel prize winner ove

194
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,200
 i do do space stuff though that bit was right i'm very careful about this because i know i think

195
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,240
 at least oxford have like rules about one who is ladcon's health professor and it's definitely not

196
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,720
 people are not better i know it's a joke but that is probably next for john then sir john

197
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:26,880
 so john cpe no i don't think i mean i don't think i mean right next for john is finishing his fellowship

198
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,760
 and becoming a proper lecturer let's not skip all of the intervening stages

199
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,680
 it's true the next thing john is that you age out of early career things and a force to consider

200
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:43,840
 yourself mid-career yeah i mean yes that is true in other news about cool things john and i are doing

201
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,760
 i'm going to segue here hey that's a nice segue so this episode we are going to talk about things

202
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,120
 we are nominating for the hughos in 2025 and the reason we are doing this staggering the early

203
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:23,860
 is that john and i have become members of the wis

204
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,860
 site selection but i am going to cease to talk about the bob the podcast for a little while

205
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,980
 yeah it's going to be interesting because what are we going to talk about all through

206
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,700
 like the summer leading up to the atl if it's not hughos it's going to be difficult i'm going to

207
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,540
 have to think about other stuff beaches parties weather whether or not it's dark where lizz is

208
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:46,500
 not yet so thanks as usual to the big 2025 hughos spreadsheet of doom

209
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,460
 spreadsheet of doom run by the lady business crew which as usual has been collecting

210
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,420
 potential nominees a pretty big set of them in most categories and also it means that other

211
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,900
 people can look at them and help you decide eligibility and stuff like that so thank you again for them

212
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,300
 because i'm going to be relying on that to make sure that things i nominate for 2025 are actually

213
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,020
 you know things that came out in 2024 and not things that came out in 2022 and i didn't notice for

214
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,220
 example so we're going to start with best novel i've read some novels a few guys read some novels

215
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:21,220
 i'm not sure i've read in 2024 novels yes i have read some novels i have opinions there's

216
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,020
 i'm ready for novels do you want to go first or shall i go first because you also have read

217
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:32,500
 short-form stuff right lizz uh yes some but what lizz has done is she has made the mistake of writing

218
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,820
 what she's going to say in the show notes so i can immediately snipe her and be like alien clay

219
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:43,700
 by ogio trikovsky that's pretty good yes this is now making a face i've made the mistake of telling

220
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:50,900
 john what i was going to say and now he's still a lip that's fine i've got other ones other books

221
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,020
 all right shall we do one one one two one book from john and then one book from me and you can

222
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,580
 have alien clay if you want i will yeah so i think we can both talk about alien clay alien clay is

223
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:05,380
 really good is i've also read service model by adrien trikovsky which i would say is also very good

224
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:11,540
 but i would say it is not as good as alien clay so i think i will probably nominate alien clay

225
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:18,660
 and obviously adrien trikovsky does all also have house of open wounds is it that one i thought

226
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,420
 that one was al because days have shattered thingies is this year isn't it so house of open wounds is

227
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:32,660
 2023 in the uk but 2024 in the u.s is what i think it is there are actually a surprising number of

228
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,620
 kind of edge cases this year of things which came out in the uk a year before they came out in the

229
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:44,100
 u.s and so i might end up nominating them if i have gaps in my uh nomination ballot yes so the

230
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,260
 tyrant philosophers is eligible for best series yes john you are jumping ahead

231
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:56,100
 which is fine but i was going to say we do have the possibility to do something very funny

232
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:02,900
 which is that in 2023 asian trikovsky was nominated for children of time in 2024 adrien

233
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,700
 trikovsky was nominated for the final architecture and in 2025 we could nominate adrien trikovsky

234
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,700
 for the time philosophers meaning we'll have three successive series in best series in three

235
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:18,020
 successive years which is kind of wild let's make it happen people but i like all those series so

236
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,220
 yeah for novel i have not yet read house of open wounds but i will be reading it with an i to

237
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,740
 nominating it because i really liked city of last chances and i suspect i will love house of open

238
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,620
 wounds and i suspect it is the one that will be nominated more than days of shattered faith but

239
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,420
 i will also be nominating the tyrant philosophers for best series as long as he doesn't screw up the

240
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:45,140
 second and third novels which again i suspect he will not and alien clay i have read and is brilliant

241
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,580
 and will be going on my ballot and service model is very very good but given i'm already looking

242
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,660
 down the barrel of two or three trikovsky knobs i might not make it three or four i have read i

243
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:01,940
 have read house of open wounds and i liked alien clay more i did like house open wounds but i preferred

244
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,180
 city of last chances is alien clay are standalone by any chance it is yeah yeah i have

245
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:13,780
 a alien clay ready to read so i'm quite excited you can visit like a loose sequel could occur at

246
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:19,940
 some point in that universe but i think it stands alone satisfyingly yeah and like children of ruin

247
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,580
 is not a direct sequel to children of time it's in the same universe and it's playing with similar

248
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,460
 themes but like i don't really think you have to have read read time to read ruin and i don't think

249
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,940
 ruins existence spoils time as a standalone so i think that's the other thing trikovsky is very

250
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:40,260
 good at i mean john coxin in quite likes adrien tricovsky chocker news at 10 yeah we know what this

251
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:46,100
 is podcast likes so are you guys thinking of nominating anything that's not by adrien tricovsky

252
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,980
 this year yes i'm going to nominate the tainted cup by robert jackson bennett because as we well

253
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:56,980
 know i love robert jackson bennett he's very good though i have heard great things about this

254
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:02,100
 now but that's tricky right because i might have heard the great things from liz liz do you want to

255
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,220
 tell me great things about this book i think i did it as a pick didn't i so you could just go back

256
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,220
 and listen to the episode yes so this is the locked room mystery yes which is why i'm so excited

257
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,020
 about reading it it was this is pick in episode one two three listeners so you might actually

258
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,860
 remember it but if you don't you can go back and listen to it but i was um very much excited to

259
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:30,260
 read it the tainted cup is currently 99p on high eve dot code at uk which might mean it's 99p on

260
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,780
 other e-book vendors so if you are interested in it go look it up now listeners and purchase it for

261
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,260
 cheeps in terms of things that i'm nominating that i may not have already banged down about on the

262
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:47,140
 podcast at length i have just finished the ministry of time by calian bradley which will probably be

263
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,820
 on there john's reddit i don't think we have discussed it on the pod it's essentially a novel

264
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:58,340
 in which a very limited amount of time travel exists and the narrator ends up being the bridge

265
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,500
 the sort of link to our world for time travelers who have a time travel has been snatched from

266
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:10,340
 his the past because they would have died and that is thought to leave least damage on the timeline

267
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:18,740
 so basically she ends up being the kind of 21st century guide to um graham gore from uh the

268
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,300
 franklin's lost expedition i really liked it like there's there are different ways you can go but i

269
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,260
 think it manages to do quite a lot of sort of light fun stuff about the sort of fish out of water

270
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:36,900
 21st century person who the housemate of a victorian sailor plucked out the ice but it manages that

271
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,900
 very well with the kind of seriousness that is also in the in the premise i think and that's what

272
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,380
 i liked about it it feels very british it's thinking a lot about empire and colonialism which is

273
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,180
 obviously you know there's a lot of that in britains history but also feels quite universal

274
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,260
 some of it is just funny in it feels very set in london it's feels kind of set in sort of british

275
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:05,860
 bureaucracy and i think it kind of very satisfyingly takes that fun comedy romance aspects but then

276
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,860
 ties them into the the deeper story which is a lot more interesting and a lot more serious and

277
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:18,420
 thinking but i do like the you kind of 15 pages in and she's already trying to stop graham gore from

278
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:24,020
 breaking the toilet and chain smoking everywhere i liked it a lot to echo i think everything liz

279
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,180
 said i think it has interesting things to say about gender and ethnicity which i think ties

280
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:34,340
 into its opinions on colonialism and empire but i also thought the characters were extremely

281
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:41,380
 well drawn and i liked them very much and yeah i just i really liked it it may well be on my ballot

282
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:47,700
 it is one of the ones i have very much enjoyed this year so i i would echo liz to go on to

283
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:54,180
 another one i enjoyed from this year i'm going to pick the life impossible by matt hake i think i

284
00:26:54,180 --> 00:27:01,540
 might be this i would describe as magical realism but the magic is science fiction in that it feels

285
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:06,420
 very much like other books in the literary tradition that i've read that i kind of in the magical realism

286
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:11,620
 vein but it's explicitly science fictional rather than fantasy i think and it's set on the island of

287
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:20,660
 i beetha and it has things to say about parenthood and relationships and what it is to belong and what

288
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,900
 it is to reject belonging yeah i really enjoyed it i thought it was very good it made me cry in an

289
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:31,540
 airport i i would highly recommend people read that i think it was lovely and i've also heard

290
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,100
 not a huco recommendation but i've not read the midnight library but i've also heard very very good

291
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:42,100
 things about that and just a pick up to play somewhere else has any other review read any matt hake?

292
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,060
 no i've i've heard people saying good things about matt hake and i'm trying to remember

293
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:55,540
 what else they've written yeah i will do one more recommendation i've actually not quite decided

294
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,420
 on everything i'm going to nominate especially because in ascension and cochokia jazz which came

295
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,140
 out in the uk in 2023 or 2024 in the u.s and therefore eligible again Alice is making a

296
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,700
 face because i said in ascension i think literally that that's fine you don't appreciate uh mop

297
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,380
 at christmas carol so fine we're gonna have to differ hated it hated it i liked in ascension

298
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,820
 more than Alice and did i i i can't tell you how many reviews i've read of it which say that one

299
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,580
 of the horiest plots of the history of satsalts fiction was profound it's not it's rubbish anyway

300
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,220
 on so i was gonna uh just briefly say i might nominate the siege of burning grass by premy mohamad

301
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:43,700
 which is essentially a novel about war and pacifism and how you can end conflict by pacifism

302
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,820
 and i don't think it quite manages an ending but i did think it was very interesting

303
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,740
 Alice and there are any books you liked i don't think i've read any 24 books i'm

304
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,420
 gonna read the ones you tell me to before i get rid of lomelating maybe i've got two more i'd

305
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:06,260
 liked three more i'd like to mention if that's okay Liz no obviously yes John keep going

306
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:16,500
 i read jumpknots by how jingfang um and i really liked it it is it's a chinese novel in translation

307
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,220
 by kenlu so if you don't get on with kenlu's translations then um this will not be the book

308
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,740
 that changes your mind i don't think and it has a number of hallmarks of chinese sf for instance

309
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,860
 the plot primarily revolves around a love triangle with one woman trying to decide between two men

310
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:37,300
 and it all feels just a little bit old-fashioned from a western lens having said that i thought

311
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:44,660
 it had some wonderful ideas it is a book that was written in china in 2010 so like some of those i

312
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,460
 think old-fashioned-nesses are probably just because it is 15 years old in the original text

313
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:55,780
 and also it's a reaction like an explicit reaction to the three body problem um so i would commend

314
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:02,580
 it to anyone interested in in in that um so yeah i enjoyed it greatly the other two i would commend

315
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:08,100
 our absolution by jeff fandamir which was brilliant i talked to neel harrison about this in the pub

316
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,260
 and he said the only thing i know about it is that the end bits weird and i asked andi he said

317
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,260
 andi's read it and he liked it so i said andi you've read absolution he went yeah what did you think

318
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,700
 at the end bit and i was like it was weird and near when you see and uh and yeah but i would recommend

319
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:27,940
 absolution if you liked annihilation or if you haven't read annihilation i would i would read absolution

320
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,580
 and the other one i really liked is uh we are all ghosts in the forest by laren wilson which i

321
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,660
 thought was powerful and bleak and anger making and hopeful in sort of different ways in different

322
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:44,260
 measures and i think might end up on my ballot and i will also say i've seen people mention the book

323
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:52,660
 of love by kelly link i i just thought it was quite long and plody so like if you're seeing other people

324
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,020
 recommend that listeners i i would take those recommendations with a grain of salt but um

325
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,180
 liz what did you think of the book of love uh it's a bit long and bloody yeah

326
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:07,860
 good reads at the end of the year in my reading challenge sum up said the longest book you read

327
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:15,540
 this year was the book of love and i was like i know it's i really wanted to like it and it had

328
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:21,300
 some really great bits and it just needed an area to rank 200 pages out hmm i think i was just

329
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:28,260
 gonna say that i have not yet read ricks fall by vajor chanda sekara and i did like the saint of

330
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,780
 right doors i haven't read that yet because it's not out in the uk or we are in the uk in 2025 but i am

331
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:40,180
 expecting that maybe to make it on the ballot it's out in the u.s yes there's also um i was

332
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:46,420
 it called i asked a friend to get it for me uh the sentiments by garten batia yes we should recommend

333
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,100
 that because everyone who's read it says it's great and there is like one indian bookshop who

334
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:56,420
 will ship to europe mmm yes they mean this is not our it's obviously not a list of like the

335
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,060
 absolute best year this is things we happen to have read which we think are the best year and there

336
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:06,820
 are gaps this is very much not a slate guys yeah we're discussing books we've read and liked and

337
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,700
 books we've heard other people who we think might be worth listening to read and like and we're like

338
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:18,740
 here are some ideas for places you could start but if you have already started and you have opinions

339
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,660
 please write in and tell us them because us conveying your opinions to the podcast doesn't count as

340
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:30,980
 us having opinions and is therefore a loophole i think that's fair isn't it don't you'll have

341
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:36,900
 to check with your division head nicholas if that's not okay writing i just can mention uh the

342
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:44,500
 blog mr philips library who does an annual sort of prediction of what will be on the hugo shortlist

343
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,860
 does have a set of six current front runners of which uh the calian bedley and the jackson

344
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,980
 bennett are both in there along with service model by adrien tricoski and novels by tikin

345
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,300
 fissure kaffronard and james s a quarry which seems like a reasonable shortlist and quite a

346
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:05,620
 possible shortlist so there you go yeah i can see that i'm currently reading the book of elswear

347
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:12,420
 by kyarderibs and china maville um but the james s a quarry book is on the pile i think it's the

348
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:19,140
 next one or the one after yeah all right that was novel yeah best novella i would just say that over

349
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,700
 christmas i bought some stuff from the neon hemlock e-book shop because they had an end of

350
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:29,700
 your sale and i bought two that everyone had recommended which were um north continent ribbon

351
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,740
 by ershla witcher and a morning coat by alex jeffers both of which i liked a lot

352
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,260
 north country ribbon is actually a kind of set of it's sort of linked short stories but it's

353
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,140
 published as a novella um and so that's where i'm going to nominate it it's just linked short

354
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,420
 linked short stories of another world which i liked a lot and a morning coat is well there is a

355
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:58,580
 titular morning coat in it it is about a costumer who is mourning his father and it's all about kind

356
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:04,980
 of the process of mourning in this fancy world and i also really enjoyed that so those are two i

357
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:12,740
 have read so far that i liked nice very quickly i also had a couple of nominations for best short

358
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,020
 story one of them is grott marta by tomah's ha i found this on a recommendation list it's a nightmare

359
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,420
 magazine which i wouldn't normally read because it's a bit too horror for me but actually this is

360
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:30,820
 again a kind of story of colonial world and mysterious deaths and yeah kind of about how the

361
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,700
 planet is linked to them anyway it is i read it a while ago but it has stuck with me so that will

362
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:42,420
 probably be on there and my other recommendation is actually flash fiction from light speed and

363
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:48,660
 it's called five years of planetatris by rachel k jones it is very short it's under a thousand words

364
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,780
 but again that is one way the images and the payoff of really like stuck in my mind since i read

365
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:59,620
 so i think it is worth a look and that is all my short fiction recommendations i have not read any

366
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:08,180
 short fiction but i have read some best-related work now i haven't read an entire best-related work

367
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:15,220
 but i am going to commend to the listener track changes selected reviews by abigail nussbaum

368
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,420
 which is eligible and which is very good also i'm currently typesetting the next

369
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,540
 brianine books book and i now know what the one after that will be and ho ho there's some good and

370
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:31,060
 exciting things coming up in the best-related work category guys i'm i'm just delighted that

371
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,260
 brianine books is going from strengths and strengths and publishing lots of books i think it's a great

372
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,580
 thing and we're getting you know in in years in future years people will look on this as a really

373
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:49,060
 good series of science fiction criticism john has once again stolen my nomination but i'm not

374
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:54,660
 really surprised there i did typeset it you did yeah does that mean you get to nominate yeah fine okay

375
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:02,580
 i will i'll mention that there's a book i am halfway through and if i continue liking it i will

376
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,380
 nominate it it's a much more serious and academic book than i would usually really best-related

377
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,260
 work but i saw something about it on blue sky i thought i would give it go it's called speculative

378
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,140
 whiteness science fiction the alt-right by jordan s carol and it's kind of an academic work showing

379
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:23,700
 and talking about how the alt-right views science fiction um to advance their agenda and so far it's

380
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,740
 pretty interesting i mean apismet is also uh sparking off because there was a book called

381
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,180
 speculative blackness the future of race in science fiction a few years ago and it's from the same

382
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,620
 press so apism it's kind of also sparking off that uh which is not huio eligible but also looks very

383
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:44,260
 interesting i don't know whether interactives go here or in best game i i really really enjoy

384
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,420
 bridge command which i did this year i saw some a sorry tell somebody's list of games of the year

385
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,340
 a podcast i listened to somebody had it on their list of games of the year and i was like oh yeah

386
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,900
 no i suppose it is interactive so maybe it's an interactive it's not going to go on my best games

387
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:04,740
 list for reasons i think it's a game yeah probably is it's complicated yes it's a repeatable

388
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,620
 interactive experience right which i think qualifies it yes i mean they're all different but i don't

389
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,020
 think they're any more all different than you know when you play a game where there's a lot of

390
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,260
 different ways set up the scenario i think it's it's as different as that is so yes no it's probably a

391
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:25,860
 game it's a roguelike discuss it's absolutely absolutely not a sodding roguelike

392
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:33,940
 well this this uh if anyone has strong opinions on roguelikes or interactive theater please write in

393
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:40,500
 because i think this might be a fanzine article brewing i'm going to talk about best series so we've

394
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,300
 already mentioned the tyrant philosophers but i'd like to commend two other series to the attention

395
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,540
 of our listenership southern reach by jeff fandamere is eligible because absolution renders it so

396
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:56,580
 and i think it is a good series that i would recommend and the horace heresy which is a series i would

397
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,780
 not recommend anyone read or interact with because i think it's a bit pants but it is also a 64 book

398
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:08,100
 series chronicling the history of one of britain science fiction universes wahama four thousand is

399
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,780
 something that's very special to a lot of fans hearts especially in the uk and so it is eligible

400
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:19,540
 this is the last year it will be eligible it is finished it is 64 books long and i would argue

401
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:28,420
 it's not very good but but worth mentioning yes i will say i've only read the first two books

402
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:35,220
 it got better off to books 26 and you should really work through it till then any graphic stories no

403
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:41,060
 not yet the other one is warp your own way which is the star trek lower decks uh graphic novel by

404
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:48,340
 ryan north yeah haven't haven't done it yet which is apparently amazing and is on my radar but i

405
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,780
 have not yet read but abigail nussbaum's review at strange horizons is apparently a work of extreme

406
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:59,060
 genius so i will link that in the show notes right so about halfway through the year i resolved to go

407
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:04,580
 and see a movie every week and i did not quite manage that but the result is i have seen a dozen

408
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:11,940
 genre movies from 2020 or approximately which is sub-glider record for me um and i found it quite

409
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,700
 easy to pick my top five which will probably not be the top five on the hugo um ballot for all

410
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,700
 sorts of reasons i think the one that's most likely to get on there is the substance and the one that

411
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,220
 is second most likely to get there is on it is wollison grommet vengeance post foul but i think

412
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,580
 it's chances of doing so on nill and then the third my third fourth and fifth are all of us strangers

413
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,580
 which the guardians said was the movie of the year and wasn't really the movie of the year and it's

414
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:45,860
 probably my least favorite of these five but there we go um times stalker which nobody except for me

415
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:51,060
 as ever seen so that's not going to get on the ballot and miles ass which might not quite be

416
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,980
 science fiction it's got some science fictional elements um but it's certainly genre enough the

417
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:00,260
 hugo ballot which is quite inclusive in that thing and and the fields i'm seeing this year that are

418
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:06,820
 not in my top five are wicked beetle juice beetle juice due to gladiator to megalopolis and inside

419
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,660
 out to and i would have thought most of those have a better chance of getting on the ballot

420
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:17,860
 than any of my top picks except for the substance yes i will echo allison saying the substance and

421
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,820
 i think that is all going to be on my ballot the other ones on my ballot are probably going to be

422
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:31,860
 fieriosa i saw the tv glow and then the other ones i've seen that i might consider nominating are

423
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:38,500
 late night with the devil which i did quite like a quite place day one which i also did quite like

424
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:44,660
 and when i haven't seen but i want to watch before the nomination deadline is the wild robot which i

425
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:51,300
 heard a lot of good things about but did not manage to get to before it came out of the cinemas i want

426
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,660
 to pick up most of those certainly the wild robot um people liked a lot but i didn't go to sit in

427
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,340
 the cinema deliberately because i thought it would make me feel a bit sick all the way through

428
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,140
 and i would rather watch that at home it's been like christmas movies right it's gonna it's going

429
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,660
 to be far too sentimental for me shall we do short form yeah i have a lot to say on the looking

430
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:18,260
 through the spreadsheet um for short form the ones that i've seen that i don't see represented here

431
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:24,820
 like the show i've been watching is sunny which is on apple tv plus and is science fiction and is

432
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,460
 not on the spreadsheet and then there are some others which like i don't know there's one from the

433
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,940
 acolyte which you know might be good there's one from star trek various star treks which might

434
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:40,740
 be good but yeah i i i think i i i'm clearly not well read in short form either of you no i will say

435
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:46,900
 that i i do like to use the hugoards uh sheet to pixel fat for me but i don't think it's particularly

436
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:56,740
 comprehensive this year no it's quite early i think i have seen less startlingly good television

437
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:03,700
 in the last year than in previous years we're mostly watching the expanse but it's not like we're

438
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:09,460
 having to stop because of marvelous incoming television shows i don't think there's been any

439
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:18,900
 well i haven't i mean i haven't watched silo or fallout or the acolyte we do we did quite like

440
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,700
 for like but the fact is we've watched half of it and then stopped so it's probably not quite as

441
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,140
 compelling as i'd like it to be yeah it is you are coming up on like the probably the third anniversary

442
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:37,300
 of watching the expanse it's more yeah indeed okay but i don't have a lot to say about short form but

443
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,940
 i think the short form does not be grateful i just told this list is it i thought it was isn't

444
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,620
 not they'll have mentioned a particular episode work there and i don't know oh no there too the end

445
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:53,060
 in the beginning are the four episodes that they've recommended someone's put every single episode

446
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:58,260
 of the three body problem except for episode six and i want to know what went wrong in episode six

447
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:05,140
 like was episode six just real bad if anyone's watched episode six of three body problem please

448
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:10,580
 write in because i'm fascinated i mean i have Liz what was wrong with it why is it the only

449
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:17,940
 episode that doesn't deserve to be all the spreadsheet i don't know it's not like episode six is a

450
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:24,740
 a special flashback event or anything like that it's just another episode shall we talk about best

451
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:30,500
 interactive yeah why not do you want to go first john i'm not sure i've played any 2024 video games

452
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:37,540
 i know star wars outlaws is eligible but it is on my shelf and i have not got to it yet but what i

453
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:44,020
 have done is played some board games and i will enthusiastically recommend a couple of those

454
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,700
 so the board game arcs by colverley published by leader games is very good and has been making

455
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,940
 waves in the tabletop space so imagine a cross between hearts and twilight imperium there's city

456
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,420
 of six moons which i have not played but the rulebook is in an alien language that was invented

457
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:05,300
 by the designer and to play the game you have to translate the rulebook first which like i think

458
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:12,020
 just sounds absolutely fascinating and i think deserves a shout out but also i if this is a board

459
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,980
 game i'm going to say i play so many rulebooks where the rulebook has been written in an alien

460
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,540
 language and you have to invent it by the designer and you have to translate it first and then the

461
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:30,020
 other one that i think is good is undaunted 2200 colisto which basically takes the

462
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:34,420
 undaunted game and updates it to a science fiction universe where instead of playing axes versus

463
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:40,180
 allies in world war two you're playing striking miners versus corporate security on the moon of

464
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:47,540
 colisto which uh astute listeners will recognize is probably more my cup of tea setting wise

465
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:54,100
 but those are probably the games that i will consider uh nominating oh and um i think mothership is

466
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:59,300
 technically eligible because its first edition came out in 2024 and i will also nominate that

467
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:06,820
 that's a role-playing game but i picked it uh in the episode before last episode 124 so uh if you're

468
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:11,060
 interested in my thoughts on that you can go listen to that episode um played any of those yes so

469
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:16,100
 for best game interactive work we have the rise of gold nidl as i mentioned on a previous episode

470
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,620
 episode 124 listeners the thing is i bought a playstation 5 and i was played dragon age vale

471
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:27,700
 guard i haven't started yet but unless it absolutely sucks which is possible by a way a swing from

472
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,220
 high to low is quite a lot then it's going to be on my ballot on video games i have a top six i'm

473
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:41,540
 not quite sure what i'm going to hound gonna narrow it down my top six are um animal well uh which

474
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:46,500
 you know is a game about animals falling down the well as i picked it ufo 50 which is a collection of

475
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:53,460
 50 games that prepared it to be retro games and i picked that um slice and dice 3.0 which is uh

476
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:58,740
 great development of slice and dice and i picked slice and dice but maybe in its 2.6 format

477
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:04,740
 caves of could which finally had its release after 15 years of development um at the end of the year

478
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,580
 and then the last two one of which is going to get on the ballot one of which isn't art

479
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:18,100
 blackro which is an incredibly um addictive kind of game that simulates is a deck building version

480
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:24,020
 of video poker that probably picked that as well and you know anytime you've got a free weekend

481
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,500
 with nothing in it i would recommend downloading blackro and seeing if you like it because it

482
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:34,580
 you know might fill up your weekend and um Zelda echoes of wisdom which wouldn't be my pick this

483
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:40,500
 episode okay i'll talk about it when we do pick while i do enjoy blackro i would not consider

484
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,300
 it to be science fictional in any way i would like to be the party poo per and say that i just

485
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,540
 don't like blackro that's fine i play it and then i put it down for bit and then i play a bit more

486
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,460
 so it's obviously not like hooked me in yeah the other five clearly are well that's solved my

487
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,580
 problem though because blackro is not science fiction there you go not really apart from the

488
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:02,420
 planets it's got planets in it it's got cards which are planets so for those who want to know uh

489
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:11,460
 allison picked animal well in 113 uh ufo 50 in 120 caves of cud in 124 and legend of Zelda echoes

490
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:17,140
 of wisdom later this episode and and i think i picked slice of dice at some point and if i haven't

491
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:22,180
 i must talk about it sometime nope it doesn't appear on the spreadsheet as far as i can tell slice of

492
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:28,420
 dice is a deck building with dice um i'm excited about best poem uh and i imagine i'll nominate a

493
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:34,500
 bunch of stuff by sandra bond and someone really ought to go through on the spreadsheet and put

494
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,380
 some of her good poems on the spreadsheet because so far they are not there and that is a crying

495
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,620
 shame and it might be me but it also might not be me so if you're listening and you've got a spare

496
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:49,700
 weekend get on it fan categories i guess i will be nominating banana wings because banana wings is

497
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:55,860
 great i'll be nominating the unofficial hugo book club and i'll be nominating nerds of a

498
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:00,100
 i'll nerds of a feather accused i will not be nominating those of a feather i will be

499
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,540
 donating orna fopter by lee Edmonds i will nominate some of those other things you mentioned but

500
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:12,660
 probably also and siri review of books in fan writer i will nominate kamestros falapton because

501
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:18,660
 i believe he he recused last year but i think the reason he did was because he was worried people

502
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:25,460
 would give like give him too much kudos for the stuff he'd done in 2024 so i'll be nominating this

503
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,180
 year for the things he did in 2024 which i thought were very good i'll be nominating

504
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:35,540
 er sats culture because i think the stuff he does is also very very good i'll be nominating

505
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:41,540
 rosanna pendelbury because i think her writing is very lovely and i would like to see her on the

506
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:47,300
 ballot and probably others i'm not thinking of at the moment but yeah that's why i kind of start her

507
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:53,780
 for ten i need to think about this in more detail probably some of the nerds of a feather

508
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:59,540
 collective as individual fan writers even though they are not nominatable as a fanzine this time

509
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:06,020
 and then for a fan artist i will be nominating is spany and sherry and allison scott i haven't

510
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,820
 i haven't thought about the fan categories properly yet that's fair well you do have more time it's

511
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:16,100
 just that don and i should probably stop endorsing things i do so you may just have to have kind of

512
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:21,460
 drop in allison talks about the hugos elements and then we could have john and let's talk about

513
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,660
 slight selection elements

514
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:32,580
 our fan cast i thoroughly commend that everyone uh nominates hugo girl who are our transatlantic

515
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:38,660
 podcast besties and they are great and i will remind people that they can nominate the series of

516
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:45,620
 phallak fan history zooms which in 2024 did include one on the plucked cabal which yeah i was on

517
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:50,660
 but otherwise lots of interesting stuff still happily once a month and they're very good i will

518
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:57,380
 again plug going road by tansy garden as i have been several years and a meal of thorns which is

519
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:03,940
 kind of the podcast of the ancillary review of books hosted by jake seller bookins and most

520
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:09,060
 of their episodes are a deep dive into a single book but they also do a 2024 wrap up episode which

521
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:16,100
 i quite liked do we have any astounding or load star picks oh yes so um monocle black goose

522
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:22,420
 who wrote shaper dragon's breath uh will be in uh their second year of eligibility this year so

523
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,140
 they're still eligible hey do you think you're any reason eligible

524
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:33,780
 it's quite funny i but you'll know in a month

525
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:45,860
 shall we do picks i feel i'm opinioned out quick picks liz quick picks pick quick

526
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,940
 i'm gonna pick earthborn rangers which i think i did talk about this time last year because it

527
00:50:51,940 --> 00:51:00,260
 was eligible for huco it is a lovely little game it's basically in terms of theme in terms of setting

528
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:08,740
 it's along a similar line to horizon zero dawn in that it's kind of set in a post post collapse

529
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:14,980
 world where humanity is kind of more in tune with its surroundings and living with kind of ruins of

530
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:20,980
 the previous civilization and that kind of thing uh in terms of gameplay it's quite similar to

531
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:27,220
 arkamhar the card game but it does some tweaking here and there which is kind of interesting in

532
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:34,100
 places and um and yeah it's just a very lovely game and it's curiously aimless um you can be

533
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:40,100
 basically wander around for 30 days and then that's the end of your campaign and if you want to

534
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,140
 devoutly ignore the plot and just do your own thing you can uh which is not the sort of thing you

535
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:51,380
 can really do in arkam so yeah it's an interesting game and i am so far very much enjoy again um

536
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,380
 so i'm going to pick it i'm looking forward to showing it to other people too don't know

537
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,140
 as i'm trying to bully me into picking things even though i've just spent the like the last

538
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,820
 hour and a half giving them my opinions on things so why don't i pick the fact that they remastered

539
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:11,460
 horizon zero dawn so you can play on your playstation 5 now and it looks pretty hey oh it did look

540
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:17,140
 quite pretty to begin with looks even pretty now i've been replaying it oh that's a great show

541
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:23,140
 especially because um we've never picked horizon zero dawn on the podcast which is weird why didn't

542
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:28,820
 i pick it because i think probably we had not started i don't even know if we'd started the

543
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,740
 podcast but i don't think we'd started picking ah we put it in done picks i played i definitely

544
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:40,980
 played her as a zero dawn after we started the podcast because i didn't get a ps4 until you

545
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:48,500
 sold me your old one john which was after we started the podcast so true it came out in 2017

546
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:53,940
 yeah but i definitely played it in 2020 because i bought a playstation in march 2020 having you know

547
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:59,060
 seen them writing on the wall and then just hold up inside playing horizon zero dawn for like a month

548
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,540
 it's i mean it's very good listeners like i think we've probably mentioned it before even though

549
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:09,700
 we've not officially picked it but horizon zero dawn i i would commend to you as a thing that is

550
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:15,140
 worth experiencing we also need to do the traditional mark alerts because allison is about to make it

551
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:22,340
 three games from three go allison go am i yeah no i might be um i am picking zelva echoes of wisdom

552
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:27,140
 which is the new two-d zelva which is kind of weird because it's actually a really 3d game

553
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,620
 i mean i'm quite old and by my status this is quite a three-dimensional game but anyway

554
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:37,700
 you play it's a zelta game and because of that you play as zelva which obviously you have done in

555
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:43,860
 the previous 19 000 delta games um nope this is the first time you've got to play as zelva and

556
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:49,780
 zelva has a bunch of skills which are not the same skills as link who is normally the

557
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:56,260
 protagonist of the zelta games instead you make copies of the things that you find in the world

558
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:00,660
 in particularly you make copies of the monsters you kill which is then sent into battle for you so

559
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:07,460
 zelva is actually a necromancer in this game because she revives all the corpses of dead things

560
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:13,220
 she's fought i'm sure that's that's proper law right in many ways this is because i didn't like

561
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:20,660
 zelva breath of the world very much um see pug cost passing because it was kind of a an open world

562
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,980
 sandboxy type thing where you could go all over the place and do everything but it didn't have

563
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:30,820
 sorts of things i really like about zeldens which are dungeons and puzzles and a little

564
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:37,380
 tight things that are gated so echoes of wisdom doesn't have the gating you can still pretty much

565
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:43,380
 go anywhere as soon as you work out that the purpose of your old bed is to make stacking staircases

566
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,100
 of old beds that allow you to go all over the map but otherwise it's quite like proper zelva it

567
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:54,020
 has dungeons it has bosses it has lots of puzzles and it has lots of side quests and interactions

568
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:59,380
 with the people in the world and it's it's a little bit simple maybe i deduced from this is

569
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,820
 because i'm managing to defeat the bosses rather than bashing up against them multiple times before

570
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:09,780
 go to the internet and finding out how i was supposed to have done it but i'm really loving it i'm

571
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:15,380
 enjoying every minute of it it's a delight i got shamed into buying it by my offspring who was like

572
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,500
 i didn't buy it because i wanted to play it i bought it because i wanted you to be happy with

573
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:24,660
 zelda and zelda again and i do like playing as zelda i'm quite um i'm quite shallow and getting to

574
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:29,300
 play as getting to play as the princess is pretty good i would like to say i would like to don my

575
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:35,700
 mike scott cosplay and note that in fact the first time you were able to play zelda was zelda the

576
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:44,420
 wand of gamelon which was for the phillips cdi in 1993 i have not played that game have you played

577
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:50,260
 that game i have not played that game it has a reputation for being extremely poor it is not

578
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:56,980
 canon it was not on a nintendo console and the gameplay was apparently atrocious but it does exist

579
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,380
 and i never thought i'd get to mention it on the podcast but yeah i don't even know if there's a

580
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:06,900
 cdi emulator for mak that means i can play it but i think there's a there's a video play through

581
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:12,900
 on youtube which i am definitely good edge magazine noted that zelda fans consider the cdi

582
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:18,580
 games tantamount to blasphemy and the other thing i want to say about zelda recos of wisdom is that

583
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:23,860
 you can you can whip out the zelda's princess bed to have a kip in the middle of boss fights and

584
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:29,540
 get your health back which is a new one on me brilliant i want to play it i am also not a big

585
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:34,260
 fan of breath of the wild but i really liked the remaster of links awakening so i'm hoping that

586
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:40,420
 echoes of wisdom is more like links awakening for me people say that echoes of wisdom is quite a

587
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:45,460
 lot like links awakening which i have not played so yeah at least if you haven't played links awakening

588
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:51,780
 is good that was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye for me it's goodbye for me and it's goodbye

589
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,780
 for me

590
00:56:53,780 --> 00:57:18,580
 hang on a sec while i load the Dublin program from the way back machine it must be possible to find

591
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:23,780
 the Dublin program yeah yes is exactly what i am doing while you are chatting about the ending

592
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:30,420
 of game of thrones oh there we go okay speakers oh no it's archived like the list of all the people

593
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,980
 who are on program but not the links of what they're actually on you must have an email with it in

594
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:43,140
 i have well i found the pocket program pdf on Dublin 2019 dot com ah so i was on 40 years of the

595
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:52,260
 force fab or fail i was on fanzines now i was on dc tv versus film and i was on the comics galaxy of

596
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:58,980
 star wars i was on latest results from asteroid missions and that was my list so if it was the dc

597
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:04,660
 tv panel but i don't think i was one about on one about endings do you think we might be getting

598
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:11,780
 into the weeds i want to know who the john doppelganger is okay i'm sorry this is gold i was wrong i'm

599
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:16,900
 looking for the word television in this program guide and do you know it comes up quite a lot

600
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:22,740
 but i can't find one about how shows ended do you think it's possible the panel went slightly

601
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:28,580
 off topic from the stated subject during the panel could have been i also think it's possible

602
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:33,620
 like june if you ever been to any other conventions because i have been to others right in

603
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:38,420
 she's in new zealand though have you been to any new zealand i've never been to one in new zealand

604
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:46,660
 but i i don't think there was a panel at dublin on how shows ended as far as i can tell from

605
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:51,140
 looking through not a bad panel idea though if anyone wants me to be contrary about game of

606
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:59,380
 thrones put that uh put that panel in your program uh on the subject of program i've got some hot

607
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:05,780
 goss which is that um the belfast east god have recruited to do people to their committee

608
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:11,060
 which is margarita smith and megg but donald have both uh been recruited i think megg's heading

609
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:16,900
 up program i'm not sure what margarita's doing but you know very good stuff do we think it might have

610
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:23,780
 been narrative in the dollar understanding contemporary tv which is about how contemporary tv shapes

611
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:28,900
 like how tv structures work but i don't know if any of the people on that are doppelganger johns

612
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:34,660
 yeah i was gonna say am i do you reckon abigay or nussbaum was the me the june met or

613
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:41,380
 no i reckon it's adam whitehead could be adam whitehead anyway we may have gone off topic a bit too much

614
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,380
 yes because we didn't get fun we didn't if there was a fun explanation for who the john doppelganger

615
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:49,940
 was this would be fun but i don't think there was long i choose to believe that me and abigay

616
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:55,860
 on usbound are very easily confused i mean i i i i confused you and abigay i only do have the

617
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:02,180
 week till listeners liz liz liz looks less sure than we do on this matter i think it's fair to say

618
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,540
 yeah i was trying to think of some funny way to tie this all together and i could not
