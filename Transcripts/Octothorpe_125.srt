 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 125th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science fiction and

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,960
 science fiction fandom which is coming to you with a twinkle in its eye and a Christmassy

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,600
 Ho Ho Ho on the 19th of December 2024. I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,840
 Ho Ho Ho. I was going to say Bar Humbug. I just want to have it noted that John instructed us all to

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,800
 come wearing our Christmas hats to record this episode and I brought a wide variety of festive

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,040
 Christmas hats and they're discovered that they do not fit properly over my headphones and then

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,720
 I discover that neither of the other two have bothered. I meant it metaphorically. John's not the boss

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,560
 of me, I'm not wearing a hat just because he insists on it. I didn't insist it was a metaphor.

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,080
 If you've said it, if you've meant it metaphorically you should have said metaphorical Christmas hats

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,640
 not maybe get the box of hat Christmas hats down from the high shelf which is something that I

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,920
 am not skilled in. I had to get a Christmas hat getting down helper elf. I see. I am sorry, I did

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,760
 not bring a Christmas hat to the conference I've had so I can only apologize.

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,640
 Alison waving Christmas hats at the screen is not a good podcast activity.

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,840
 Is that a Christmas hat or is it just a moose hat? It's a moose hat. A moose inherently Christmassy?

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,440
 I mean if you do want an art prompt then just draw the three of us wearing a variety of Christmas

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,720
 hats perched on headphones. 100% done. And with that out of the way it's time for letters of comment.

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:04,880
 Who would like to introduce the first one? We heard from Chris Garcia. Hi Chris. He is a tolerant man

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,320
 but he can't hold with anyone saying the best GTA game isn't either San Andreas or Vice City.

20
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,360
 I knew this was going to cause trouble. Definitely not. I knew this was going to cause trouble.

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,880
 You started it. I've already made my opinions on these clear. Speaking of dimensions by the way

22
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:30,240
 I've been playing Monument Valley 3. Which is more Monument Valley. Did you like one and two?

23
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,160
 You were like more of the same. Yeah. Yes. Fair. I like one and then I thought well two is just the

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,640
 same as one really. Yeah there's more of it. This is on topic for the on brand for me. Chris also says

25
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,080
 he thinks having a treasurer who is also a co-chair makes sense especially to make sure there is not

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,360
 kind of a distance where the treasurer is siloed off and the chairs are not aware of issues which is

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 also a good point. You just have to make sure that there are other people raining in if you have

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,560
 a chair treasurer who likes to spend your cash. Yes. And also he agrees with me that coconut and almond

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,240
 milk are clearly milks. Trees are evolutionarily older than cows. I was listening to the Beef and

30
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,760
 Dairy Network podcast as one was talking about leaf milk which is where you take the liquid off the

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,280
 leaves and it's very hydrating and that was pleasantly stupid. That's water isn't it? That is indeed

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,160
 the joke. Yes. And Laurie did also comment I'm going to ask for liquidized oats next time she

33
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,280
 orders her coffee. Bet it's on what happens. I think they'll ask me to leave. Laurie please

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:46,080
 report back. We also heard from Raj on Mastodon where he said he's looking forward to reconnect but

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,000
 he probably wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't the first Northern Ireland EasterCon so he thought

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,120
 it feels he has to support it. So that's an interesting one right like I go to every EasterCon.

37
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,080
 I think there are more people who would go to the convention straight after a WorldCon that

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,960
 wouldn't but then he also notes that there will be hopefully two Glasgow cons in as many years

39
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,200
 because there will be satellite 9 and the 2027 EasterCon bit and that means he's going to more

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,080
 cons in a few years than the whole of the last decade and yay conventions. There are also conventions

41
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,560
 outside of Northern Ireland and Glasgow, Raj which are also available. Conventions right in.

42
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:31,920
 Indeed. I mean that sounds good to me because I don't think I have met Raj in person. No. Were

43
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:40,400
 you at satellite 8? No. And Raj got Covid at WorldCon. Yes. So yeah no you wouldn't have done.

44
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,960
 So reconnect. Raj say hi. Yes. Yeah definitely Raj. But it's a false

45
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,680
 what's name isn't it? Because you're not reconnecting you're just connecting. Is that allowed?

46
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,040
 I think at reconnect we can only talk to people we already know. I don't think meeting new people

47
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:07,920
 will be sanctioned. Recollects, right in. Again. Right. And then there were Facebook things.

48
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,960
 Alison do you want to read out the Facebooks? So lots of people agreed with me in whole or in part

49
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,000
 about virtual and there's lots of interesting but not terribly summarisable commentary there.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,880
 I wanted to pick up one thing which is that JT wrote and said I think I am agreeing with you

51
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,360
 that core offerings should focus on simple things that like hybrid that leverage existing work and

52
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,800
 add benefit to impersonate Nd's rather than burdening over work teams by adding additional

53
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,320
 layers like running completely virtual streams in parallel. And I want to kind of respond a

54
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,760
 little bit on that because I think it's half true. I don't think there's a lot of merit in having

55
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,760
 like panels in virtual at conventions except possibly for a very large convention because

56
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,880
 I think panels in person are great and there are lots of them and unless you're specifically trying to

57
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,200
 showcase somebody who wouldn't otherwise get and even if you are trying to do that I'm not sure

58
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,720
 that panel is the very best way to do it. What I do think you have to do though is if you're

59
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,680
 having an in-person event then your social happens automatically because there are a lot of people

60
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,200
 in the same space and they want to socialise. And the social programme is provided by the bars

61
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,480
 and restaurants and activities that you could do in the local area. If you're running a virtual

62
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,120
 convention then you actually have to programme in your socialisation stuff and that is a stream

63
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,120
 or maybe a couple of streams on its own. So although for Back to the Futures we took all of our

64
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,080
 programme from Glasgow we did have I don't know about 10 or 15 items that people had offered to

65
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,560
 us that were specific things to do virtually as a social event. And I think if I was running like

66
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:53,600
 in EG if I was running the virtual social spaces for a Worldcon I would want to have some sort of

67
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,800
 that programming of that kind going on almost all the time at the Worldcon as an option for people

68
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,800
 to gather socially and do things in virtual spaces. This is not necessarily a job application.

69
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,880
 It's important to clarify. Yeah. I guess there's an open thing about virtual streams which is like

70
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,800
 if you do the social virtually does that mean that people from the convention don't join in

71
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,040
 but I still don't know how you fix that. So yeah, it's tricky isn't it? I just I just be happy if

72
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,200
 most of the virtual people did join in. That's my first goal in this rather than trying to say

73
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,080
 oh if you're actually at the Worldcon in person what you want to be doing is going and looking at

74
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:47,200
 all the virtual stuff as well. So one piece of news we had this week we don't normally talk about

75
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,280
 like every award in the science fiction community however the Rotsler Award was announced at Los

76
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,200
 Con. It is given annually for one to working with graphic art in amateur publications with

77
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,080
 science fiction communities so it is very unusual and it is an actual award for fan artists. I know

78
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,160
 there's a Hugo one but otherwise we are there are not that many awards fan artists and it comes

79
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,280
 with an honorarium so there's actual cash attached to it rather than just a trophy so that's quite nice

80
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,560
 and this year we were absolutely delighted to hear that it has been awarded to España Sheriff

81
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,160
 who of course has done cover up for us. Do any of you know España? Who? No yes we're very proud

82
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,440
 very proud of my lovely wife is brand new for winning this is um yes it was very lovely news

83
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,600
 congratulations España. Excellent news yes very good news

84
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:51,680
 Seattle in 2025 has given us an early Christmas present because they've made the business meeting

85
00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:02,480
 virtual and this is very good and no one minds or you know no one yeah don't say what you were

86
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:11,440
 going to say there Tom. How are we feeling about this gang? Okay so what do you think we think about

87
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,240
 it on a scale of one to oh that's fantastic holy fuck I'm so pleased I'm going to think nine yeah

88
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,080
 some people have got their niches in a bit of a twist I mean I think I think I'm I'm positive

89
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,520
 but I think I am slightly less positive than Alison just because I am at the moment we are it's a

90
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,600
 pre-kind of a pre-announcement we're very low on detail of how Seattle will actually do the business

91
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,080
 meeting the business they're not going to kind of just invent an entirely new set of rules I think

92
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,680
 I think it's still going to be a thing where we have to figure out how to do Roberts Rules of Order

93
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,000
 in a virtual space I do have confidence in the business meeting team to do that

94
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,200
 but I think they've basically announced this a bit maybe a bit before they otherwise would have

95
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,120
 because it was smough gone last weekend as we are recording and that is a good place for people

96
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,320
 to have discussions about this I haven't seen anything that's come out of smoughcon about it but I think

97
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,120
 that's possibly why they did and I guess the other interesting thing is that rather than designate say

98
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,200
 a weekend when they're going to do this they have picked four dates to do it and they haven't said

99
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,880
 the times yet but I think they're going to do it kind of at different times as they say they're

100
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,120
 going to try and accommodate you know religious observance work commitments and times own differences

101
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,560
 so I'm assuming there will be at different times on those dates so I can see that if what you want

102
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,160
 to do is go to all the business meeting sessions it is probably going to require quite a bit of

103
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,680
 rearrangement of your life on those four weekends to try and do that and those weekends do include

104
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:50,000
 like the 4th of July which I understand is a holiday in America so you know you may have to

105
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,160
 rearrange plans you have made if you really want to go to all the sessions I don't think there was a

106
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,560
 good solution here you know if they decide oh we're going to hold them all on like four consecutive

107
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
 Sundays at 10 a.m. Seattle time then that will eliminate some people from being able to tend

108
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,440
 entirely you can't hold them all on say Saturdays for maximum which would probably maximize and

109
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,240
 I'm hoping you could go say late on Friday night Saturday or like late into Saturday for different

110
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,120
 time zones because that will exclude everyone who's got religious observances on those days so I

111
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,840
 don't think there is a perfect solution but it's going to be interesting to see how this works if

112
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,840
 you kind of look at this schedule in the end and say okay the only I can only reasonably get to one

113
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,080
 of these business meetings but maybe the thing I really want to discuss is going to be in the one

114
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,800
 after can I rearrange everything to do that so I think if you really want to go to all of them you

115
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,200
 have some reasonable objections to this new system fair enough but I mean I'm in favor because I do

116
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,640
 think we should try yeah I don't think we know the perfect solution but why not give this a go and

117
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,880
 see how it works I'm sure if like everyone finds this to be an unworkable system then we'll come up

118
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,440
 with a different one but at the moment we have a different unworkable system so I don't object

119
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,120
 to conventions trying a different one see if it works better yeah and the the people who spend

120
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:13,520
 their whole worldcon in the business meeting and will now find themselves nothing like as in control

121
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:21,840
 of the power centers as they were before are pretty upset and but I mean I don't see that they

122
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,680
 have any more right to speak for worldcon members than all of the other people at the worldcon who

123
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,200
 are enjoying themselves all weekend and choosing not to spend all of their time in the business

124
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,000
 meeting or all of the people who are working all weekend and so cannot spend their time in the

125
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,920
 business meeting or all of the people who are not able to attend the worldcon every year and so

126
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,000
 cannot spend all their time in the business meeting because this will in franchise the supporting

127
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 members that might or might not might go quite badly I don't know that's the thing that we'll have

128
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,560
 to see it is very experimental so there's a couple of things which is like there has to be there has

129
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,240
 to be a business meeting at the worldcon but there still will be because there will be a site

130
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,920
 selection meeting so like site selection will still be done physically at the worldcon I assume

131
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,920
 because I assume that's where the voting is going to happen and at the moment the constitution says

132
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:19,120
 that business meeting shall be held at advertised times at each worldcon it's tricky because there's

133
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,920
 wiggle room there as we found out in 2020 but and also it's tricky because there's no actual teeth

134
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,840
 to the constitution but like in theory they have to be able to advertise times at each worldcon

135
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:40,720
 the um and I can see that there's an argument for I can see that there's an argument for being

136
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:49,200
 careful about allowing the worldcon government structure to be open to anyone who wants to sort

137
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,440
 of buy enough supporting memberships that they can sway things which is kind of what happened with

138
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,080
 the puppies in the mid 2010s whereas basically like the hugos ones we opened up to um supporting

139
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,240
 members voting um without attending the convention were more vulnerable than they were previously

140
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:14,000
 and that um limiting it to people who attend the convention is in its own way a it's obviously a

141
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,920
 gate you're keeping a gate but that gate can be used to um prevent bad actors as well as

142
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,240
 preventing good actors so it there are concerns there and I do think we need to go into their

143
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,760
 discussion without eyes wide open about that but also I do think that the infraentroisment is

144
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:44,640
 massively um a good thing and I also think that it's unfair to expect people who care about the

145
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:53,840
 worldcon but don't actually want to spend their worldcon just in meetings um though those people

146
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,080
 deserve to have their thoughts about how worldcon is governed listened to and and synthesized too so

147
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:07,440
 yeah in general I'm pro um which will not really surprise anyone who has listened to previous

148
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,680
 episodes um but yeah in general I am pro I think you're absolutely right that we have to be a

149
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,160
 little bit careful because the as we yeah decreased the barrier to involvement we also decreased

150
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,560
 the barrier to bad actors getting involved we do and so you have to be able to run this

151
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,600
 meeting in such a way that it can't be easily disrupted by anyone who buys a supporting membership

152
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,600
 basically just to you know try it but then again that's the thing we see we see how it works

153
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,920
 if I had to pick a person on earth most able to deal with bad actors wanting to

154
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,360
 troll the business meeting just look would be my choice yeah I do know that in class go

155
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,080
 we repealed the standing rules thing about no meetings should we schedule to begin before 10am

156
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,400
 or after 1pm local time which I didn't realize at the time didn't really think about the fact that

157
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,400
 will give some more freedom to the scheduling of the virtual meetings I hadn't noticed that

158
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,480
 say that again sorry I think the argument was no one is trying to start the business meetings

159
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,880
 at 8am anymore and so that was kind of an unnecessary standing rule but it does give a lot more freedom

160
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,280
 to the virtual ones oh yeah no okay yeah I see what you mean it is interesting because is the

161
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:31,680
 internet a non-smoking environment because standing rule 1.4 says it has to be and who knows if if

162
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,880
 someone is smoking on the zoom tricky no so there are like little um there are some little

163
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,240
 things here and there that like it's kind of interesting to see how it all insects but like I

164
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,760
 agree with you just because there will be difficulties though that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to

165
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:56,640
 do it and to make it good and like I think there is some gnashing of teeth I've seen a couple of

166
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,760
 people being like oh anyone who's criticizing this plan is being seen as being like anti-progress

167
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:10,480
 and it's like well I mean hmm that's tricky isn't it I have strong I do have a strong emotional

168
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,680
 I think that there are a lot of people who for whom the the business meeting is the focus of

169
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,720
 their world con and it's if you said oh we've just decided not to have filch this year at the

170
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,560
 World con but they are going to have to find something else to do with their time at the

171
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,320
 convention and and and it I don't think it's going to be easy for those people at all and I think

172
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,520
 there's quite a lot of them yeah I wanted to touch on that because I think there is there are people

173
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,680
 from the business meeting is there a bit of fandom just as there are people for whom all kinds of

174
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:46,480
 little niches of the World con are there bits of fandom the problem is that in most cases you

175
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,960
 enjoying your particular niche of the world con has no effect on what I enjoy but here keeping the

176
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,680
 business meetings as a thing that happens in person at the World con for quite a long period of

177
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:05,200
 time is basically preventing lots of people from being able to be fully engaged with the you know

178
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,000
 business of the World con so I think it is a little bit different right you know like you stop having

179
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,400
 filch it makes no difference to someone who loves the science program they can exist separately the

180
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,320
 business meeting cannot exist as a fandom which is not also you know a really big part of how we

181
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,200
 run things and so trying to make that accessible to more people I think has to take precedent over

182
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,520
 you know the fact that it is going to disrupt the enjoyment of some people's World cons but you

183
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,320
 know I get it like if you said we're not doing the thing you particularly love at World cons then I

184
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,280
 would be probably pretty annoyed pretty grumpy and you know you probably need some time to

185
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,760
 figure out your feelings on it and maybe by the time we get to virtual meetings people will have

186
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,080
 at least talk this out for several months and have maybe different thoughts on it my further

187
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,120
 point is that I can also see that it is you know there are ways to interpret the constitution which

188
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,280
 would be that you can't have these virtual meetings you know and it is going to come down I think

189
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,800
 to interpretation of some of the rules and it is tricky because as John has already said there's

190
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,720
 basically no enforcement of any of this if a convention decided to ignore it wholesale then

191
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,160
 there would be no I don't think there's a lot you could do so I do worry that we're kind of getting

192
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,680
 down to kind of constitutional judgment and in this case they're doing something that I agree with

193
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,160
 that you could argue is not constitutional and if they did something that I disagreed with

194
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,880
 then I would probably be very strongly arguing that wasn't unconstitutional so I'm trying to

195
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,400
 like check that I am not basically just being in favor of this because it's one I agree with

196
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,200
 because I think if we do just start wholesaling ignoring the constitution then we don't need one

197
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,320
 but again I'm not interpreting I do not spend a lot of time interpreting business meeting rules

198
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,200
 and Jesse and the subtle BM team do firstly that's an hour I lie uh let's you spend a lot of time

199
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:56,400
 interpreting rules that's why we have a jingle not in any official capacity John and I should

200
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:06,320
 never be allowed to do it in official capacity um yeah so so basically the the arguments that I've

201
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:15,840
 seen against it constitutionally seem to revolve around article 5.1.1 and 5.1.5 so 5.1.1 says

202
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,000
 business meetings of us first shall we held at advertised times at East Worldcon and 5.1.5

203
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,080
 says the quorum of the business meeting shall we 12 members of the society physically present

204
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:36,560
 and um Kate Seacore on the business meeting discord basically sort of outlined a plan to

205
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:43,760
 filibuster by challenging on both of those points every time one of these meetings is started and

206
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,240
 yeah I think it's tricky I don't know what we already know that you can have a business meeting

207
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,680
 in a place and the convention online so I would have argued that if the convention is a place the

208
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,880
 business meeting can be online and that's exactly the same relationship between the two things because

209
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,320
 Conzina did that so we know that that's fine from precedent and the fact that no one complained

210
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:14,080
 when it happened last time um and then I think the quorum shall be 12 members of the society

211
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,400
 physically present that gets harder and I don't know what physically present means because like

212
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,840
 I'm physically present in this hotel room on this zoom but like yeah I don't know so I think

213
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,040
 Mike Leib makes a point that I don't think he's totally unreasonable um he's clearly pretty

214
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,000
 knocked this change has been executed without advanced proposals discussion attempt to build

215
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,480
 consensus or any other hallmarks of democracy and and that's true but I kind of don't see how you

216
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,720
 could because you said to the people if you went into the room whether people with all the power

217
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,880
 because they're in the room where it happens have all the power and said we've decided we want to do

218
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,520
 it this way they go oh no we're not going to let you do that so you know but but I do take the point

219
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,040
 that you know using this sort of structure you could say we've decided to hold the business

220
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,000
 meeting we'll have one element of business meeting in the in at the world con for the site selection

221
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,760
 but we'll hold the other three in a bar in Seattle in July and no there won't be any online and as

222
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,240
 long as I have 12 people there that would actually be legal and I feel like that's an issue so so

223
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,280
 they are they're obviously saying no what we're doing here is widening participation and so therefore

224
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,000
 we should be allowed to do that and and so they are trying to do it by cultural consensus and I

225
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,760
 think that's fine but I think Mike's not wrong that that you could use this to indeed ignore any

226
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,840
 parts of the Constitution you wanted to really but that's I would argue quite strongly that's

227
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,400
 what they already did in Conziland in the other direction which is why I was so angry in earlier

228
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,400
 episodes of this podcast so I think that precedent this fine podcast where we were just starting in

229
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,440
 fact yeah and so I think there's already precedent that you can do that that's been used in the wrong

230
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,840
 way so using that precedent in the right way doesn't bother me over much I will also say there's been

231
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,040
 I think it's a bit unfair to say there's been no attempt to build consensus I think the consensus

232
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,600
 has been building for years that this is the thing we should be doing and like there's a few

233
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,240
 whole doubts but the reason this is being done is that at a high level in our community there is a

234
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,440
 recognition that this needs to happen and like I say that does suck for the few people who really

235
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,520
 do enjoy being in that room but I think people who run conventions at senior level are mostly

236
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:40,240
 behind this change and that's the that's really what's going on here I mean I think that's a big claim

237
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,880
 to make are the other people who run conventions at high level in the room with you I listen

238
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,120
 and I don't know because I think it's wrong to kind of take some of them extra frightened

239
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,320
 I think it's wrong to kind of say that to everyone's view is that or that lots of people of high

240
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,040
 level are that I know well I think there is a group of people involved in running conventions

241
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,800
 who are currently in charge of these these processes who are very much of the opinion that this is

242
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,560
 the way it should happen and I think there are also a group of people who run conventions who are

243
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,840
 very much of the opinion that it isn't and I think that just because we've had two conventions in a

244
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,800
 row where the people seem to be on this side doesn't necessarily mean it follows that everyone

245
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:33,440
 at that level does think this yeah no quite right I mean the example the example being

246
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,400
 you know it looked for two conventions it looked like we'd moved to a model of having

247
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,680
 world cons be called a world con number and then we had some conventions that were like no we don't

248
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,280
 want to do that so we're not going to and it yeah drawing a line through two points is dangerous

249
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:59,760
 but we will see I mean and and we'll discuss the um 20 27 world combat in a bit um but but yeah

250
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,120
 sometimes it gives me a warm feeling in my heart to know that we will never run out of

251
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:12,800
 material for the podcast yeah hey no but I think I think in general I think this is a good thing

252
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,800
 the fact that like Mike and others have noted that you could use the same loopholes in the

253
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,760
 Constitution to do bad things yes you could this is something again that I criticized four years ago

254
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,000
 and was told I was wrong and now that this has been used against the people who told me I was wrong

255
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,080
 they're like hang on a minute this is open to abuse and it's like yes yes I did point that out

256
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,560
 the Constitution is badly written it has lots of loopholes in it anyone I've talked to who has

257
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,600
 any understanding of how organizations such as this should be constituted as like this is not how

258
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,280
 you do it and yeah was for this is not fit for purpose in the way it's done so we need to start

259
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,160
 changing it and this is the first step on that road that's because it's a constitution and everyone

260
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,080
 who's complaining about the loopholes in the Constitution that might allow this to happen is

261
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,520
 fueling that fire because they have also noticed that it's not for purpose I would I would say

262
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,440
 finally I would not put it past Seattle to get around this one by having 12 people physically in

263
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,720
 one location that would count as a core business meeting and then we don't have to have that

264
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,760
 particular debate this time hmm I'm sure they're going to do that well I'm not sure they're going

265
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,240
 to do that but I would I would expect them to do that the question of whether it's at the World

266
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,840
Con there doesn't say that meeting has to be at the WorldCon it says the meetings it has to be at

267
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,000
 times that are advertised at the WorldCon it doesn't say the times have to be in the future

268
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,160
 this is the sort of loophole in the Constitution that I feel could be abused you know but there's

269
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,640
 technically nothing stopping you saying and there's also technically nothing stopping you saying well

270
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,480
 the WorldCon is technically speaking being held in Aberdeen but all of the program and the Hugo

271
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,840
 ceremony will be held in Brighton like that is allowed in the Constitution there's nothing saying

272
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,560
 the convention that people might actually want to attend could be hundreds of miles away from

273
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,040
 whether the business meeting and the technical world like the Constitution does nothing there's

274
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,760
 so much you could do if you were evil because when Nicholas said you want to run the business

275
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,280
 meeting at Glasgow I was like can I have the business meeting in Peterborough and apparently

276
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,480
 that wasn't allowed so I politely demurred but it's not not allowed because of the Constitution

277
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,160
 it's only not allowed because of decency and I'm very indecent you know don't underestimate the

278
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,960
 power of decency and constitutions I mean if you have an unwritten constitution you you rely on

279
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,760
 it all of the time

280
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:41,440
 there were updates from Smofcon which I'm picking up mostly from Vince Dockertie's report on file

281
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,600
 770 which we will link to in the show notes Smofcon 42 next year will be in Stockholm

282
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,600
 and the future bids of interest were a kind of DC Maryland Virginia I think the A is Virginia

283
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,920
 bid in 2026 and then 2027 there are apparently two possible bids one being on a cruise ship

284
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:10,960
 from LA to Mexico and one being a different European location oh yeah did you say cruise ship

285
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,560
 yes interesting when's that I'm not totally opposed to ones that run on cruise ships but I mean

286
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,640
 I'm never going to go on an LA California to Mexico cruise ship in order to go to a Smofcon

287
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,280
 but yeah I can't think of any there's been any recent conventions on cruise ships apart from

288
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,640
 like the Joko cruise which is similar but maybe not quite the same thing yeah there's the Joko

289
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,400
 cruise there's um this isn't quite what you're talking about but there's a convention called

290
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:53,840
 BGG at sea which is the board game geek cruise ooh which in summer 25 is sailing they do one from

291
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,160
 Southampton in the UK which goes around Norway and they're doing one that goes from Los Angeles to

292
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:08,880
 Mexico and like you know that does sound quite fun maybe my pick if I had managed to rewatch it

293
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:16,240
 should be that um cruise is the gods thing with Rob Bryden and Steve Coogan oh from the mid-2000s

294
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,080
 where it's about like old old stars of your sci-fi show who are on a fan cruise but I don't

295
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,760
 remember it was being very good so maybe not a pick that's fair yeah I think they do different

296
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,920
 ones every year so like the last one I think went from Spain and just went around the Mediterranean

297
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,280
 but yeah but they are not cheap if you thought world cons are expensive I'm it's probably it might

298
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,840
 not be too different actually because I guess you get all your food included but yeah you get

299
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,640
 everything and there's there are lots of there are lots of festivals held on like folk festivals held

300
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,520
 on little ship ship based festivals and um and resort based festivals and they seem to run quite

301
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,960
 well despite the fact that the normal model is we all go and sleep intense so yeah I don't think

302
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,920
 it's impossible the conventions might it might work for conventions as well actually that's not bad

303
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,520
 they're not bad the cheapest end of cruises is not significantly more than you're going to pay

304
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,400
 for five nights in Belfast all right I'm going to move on stop googling cruise prices

305
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:32,000
 so there was also Q&A for future world combids and for 2027 there were two bids Montreal and Tel Aviv

306
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,440
 and the Tel Aviv world combid has folded for 2027 so they've not folded completely but I think

307
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,160
 that accepted that 2027 in Tel Aviv is just not a goa at this time so the only bid for 2027 is

308
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:52,320
 currently Montreal and that will be voted on in 2025 at Seattle probably at the convention as

309
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,320
 previously mentioned so I mean it's almost certain to be Montreal then unless someone starts up a

310
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,160
 rival bid pretty quickly yeah so so this Montreal bid is being run by the team who demonstrated that

311
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:12,240
 they couldn't run a 600% aspect very well so I feel like if you've got any desire to run a world comb

312
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,800
 yeah I might like to put a bid together for 2027 and see if you can have a shout

313
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,040
 does anyone have any desire we're not going to run punctuation of the work on are we guys

314
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,840
 no but I will do a write-in vote for Alison's house in 2027 if you'd like

315
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,880
 yes no I'm not sure we can actually get the 12 people here for the business meeting

316
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,280
 the writing campaign starts here listeners

317
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:40,720
 I'm not doing it I'm not sharing a world con never going to happen

318
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,480
 look right we're not saying you are we're just saying that you will win the site selection

319
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,240
 and you can do with that when you want when it arises

320
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:57,440
 don't you have to file sign like a signed contract with a site because this site's definitely not

321
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,760
 signing any world con related contract I don't know I reckon if I get Stephen drunk enough

322
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,800
 I was gonna say there are other people in your house that's almost certainly true or

323
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,800
 actually Jonathan is probably your best bet I'm gonna have to tell them now do not

324
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,640
 not on any account sign anything say you'd like to hold the world con in your house

325
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,400
 do you know how small our house is we had a letter of comment from one Claire Breuerley

326
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,760
 where she said when Alison talks about her small house she must be talking a different one

327
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,480
 about a different one to the five bedroom one in central London

328
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,840
 it's not essential it is picking Wolfenstein and you might not think Wolfenstein is very

329
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,600
 far from anywhere but if somebody's trying to put the world con here by God you'd hear about it

330
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,280
 do you know how much griping we got about Excel we're a lot further out the next cell

331
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,000
 Wolfenstein you can get to town quicker from Wolfenstein from Excel surely

332
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,560
 that's not the point

333
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:57,040
 what zone do you live in I'm in zone three yeah that's central as I'm concerned

334
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,280
 we're at one eight one rather than a one seven one that's the key thing does anyone back in the

335
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,160
 days when people are telephone numbers that means nothing to anyone anymore it will mean

336
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:16,480
 nothing to our listeners also I can tell you categorically we can we have we have five bedrooms

337
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,280
 all-side of which two of them will not be available to the convention as they're being used and the

338
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,600
 other three are full of shite it's gonna be great incentive to declutter your house then isn't it

339
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,360
 um yeah so the Montreal Worldcon I would be excited about going to Montreal I will agree

340
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,840
 or I will kind of echo Alison's sentiment that given how poorly people felt Winnipeg was run I

341
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:50,000
 am I'm genuinely curious how well a world con run by the same team would be so we'll see we'll see

342
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,040
 if they win I should say it is not exactly the same team but it has many of the same elements

343
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:02,960
 hmm I think it is however quite different to the Edmonton in 2030 bid team totally different team

344
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,400
 yes yeah totally different team bidding for Edmonton they have they're not I think largely

345
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,720
 world connell's hands but that's probably quite a good thing yeah more people more people coming

346
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,680
 into the con running community is I think good for the con running community the 20 30 the 23rd

347
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:27,680
 big crew is very interesting yes I'm excited they've put them all on their website you can have a

348
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:34,480
 have a look they cover like a wide range of communities and fandoms and yeah looks interesting

349
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,080
 yeah be up yeah but yes I think unfortunately the yeah I don't know I don't know what's going to

350
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,800
 happen there because I think people might be reluctant to have two Canadian ones in three years

351
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,720
 but if kind of Montreal wins by default that may just harm the chances of Edmonton in 2030

352
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,720
 which is a bit of a shame but on the other hand no one else is bidding for 2030 yet so

353
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:03,760
 the most exciting thing on that list for me is a suggested Dutch bid for 2032 and I very much

354
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,160
 enjoyed the last Dutch world con that I went to so much that it's largely a haze it was a very

355
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,720
 long time ago and I fervently believe that I can party just as hard 32 years 42 years later a long

356
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,920
 time later that might not be true jumping back to 2028 there are still two bids Brisbane Australia

357
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,160
 for their dates on the near the solar eclipse and the Kigali Rwanda in 2028 bid and they do appear

358
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,880
 to both still be bidding and sent in you know communications and questionnaires to smoughcon

359
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,640
 and so those that that's the only contested year at the moment now and then it's Dublin in

360
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:46,000
 2029, Edmonton 2030, Texas in 2031 and potentially Maastricht in 2032.

361
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,120
 No it's interesting right and the thing on Fast 7E ends by saying you know remember that 2039

362
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:59,680
 would be the centenary of the centenary of the very first world con in New York I think I'm a

363
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:07,040
 pre-support of a Texas it'll be interesting to see whether because here in the time I've been in

364
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:19,920
 fandom the Chicago group have had 2012 and 2022 and so I kind of I guess I kind of thought 2032

365
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,280
 might be a year they were thinking of but yeah it'd be interesting to see if that's contested or

366
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,560
 whether there won't be a Chicago bid or whether like Chicago might go for a different year that

367
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,440
 will be that will be interesting to see how it unfolds but yeah I think the Netherlands bid would

368
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,120
 be lovely yeah I think it would be great I mean I don't know if there is any early planning for

369
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,640
 the next UK one probably a little bit early to start that discussion only five months after we

370
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,040
 finished the last one but maybe there'll be a Dutch one instead and the UK one will have more

371
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,960
 than a tenure gap this is like three years after 2029 in Dublin and the last Dutch World con was

372
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,400
 three years after a UK World con so it's cut they have very different flavours then and I think

373
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,800
 they probably have quite different flavours now as well Dutch World con was smaller then and I'm

374
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,600
 sure it would be smaller now than other European World cons but it still might be pretty big because

375
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,800
 European World cons are pretty big these days that's a long time yeah still I didn't even think about

376
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,800
 2039 2039 is like well the thing is if it's New York it needs to be thought about earlier than

377
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,400
 you'd think great because we need to actually work out where on earth would hold it I suspect

378
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:36,080
 2034 will be a UK bid but I don't know for sure but I would I don't know I got feeling in my waters

379
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,520
 by which I mean I've given mega 20

380
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:48,560
 did you give it straight back no no she did not there you go then you heard it here first

381
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:03,440
 the news that Vanessa Mae had passed away came recently she died after a short illness and

382
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:11,760
 it's very sad news for this did a lot for fandom and was like I always enjoyed talking to her

383
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,120
 conventions and she will be sadly missed I worked with her on multiple conventions and she she

384
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:26,720
 worked on 2018 East con and which I shared and I've known her a long time she was really one of the

385
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,720
 people who was instrumental in getting the Glasgow bid off the ground I think people forget this but

386
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:38,240
 it was originally Vanessa and Esther and Emma England but I mean you know we wouldn't necessarily

387
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,640
 have had that Wilcon if it hadn't been for Vanessa's input right at the beginning saying which she

388
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,200
 wanted the Wilcon to be in in the UK yeah so I think it was 2014 when I met all of Esther and Emma

389
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:56,480
 and Vanessa while working on the London Wilcon and it was always great to chat to Vanessa and we got

390
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:05,360
 along well and in 2016 she persuaded me that I should take the vacant position of precon access

391
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:11,920
 coordinator for the Helsinki Wilcon and you know which is a position I could not at all have done

392
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,840
 without Vanessa kind of supporting me and guiding me through the whole thing I had a lot of support

393
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,080
 from other people who had done it previously but she was really like the main thing there and she

394
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,600
 said you know Carlong do this it'll be it'll be fun and it was fun I remember we you know went to

395
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,560
 Helsinki and spent like part of the afternoon just traveling around the Helsinki tram network

396
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,520
 checking if you could actually get wheelchairs on off the trams so we could like report this

397
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,520
 to everyone but it meant just like a fun afternoon just poodling around on trams so I have a lot of

398
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:49,840
 little memories um like that and yeah very sad tears she has passed yeah I found I found her input on

399
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:56,000
 on access issues absolutely invaluable we walked walked down to the to our site and things like that

400
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,360
 at at Harrogate and spent quite a lot of time thinking about Harrogate and how it was going to

401
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,000
 work and all of them because it was not an easy site for access have a little class of Grand Manié

402
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,040
 in her honour yeah so we'll raise the toast to her I'd have thought we'd do something I would have

403
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,880
 thought these could only do something for her as she's a former East Concher

404
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:30,320
 shall we do pics yes although as mentioned I'm not sure I have a pic fine do do pics and I will

405
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,000
 tell everyone that the Christmas Carol is great whichever one knows but I will tell them again

406
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,480
 I've never seen it what I've never seen it because you know you've never told me to watch it so

407
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,200
 how would I have seen it I mean you've you've not really watched or listened and played all the

408
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,520
 rest of my pics so I don't know why this one will be different John

409
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:56,720
 rude hang on no yes so 2020 2020 Christmas we didn't do anything like this

410
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:04,960
 in the 2021 Christmas episode we did favorite Christmas songs 2022 you picked it by Stephen King

411
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,400
 which you know great shout but festive it is not and then um and then 2023

412
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:23,280
 2023 we talked about festive games and it's just got it's just got a note which says Liz hated by

413
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:31,520
 Emily and Andrew and I don't know why well what did you do to Emily and Andrew Liz no one knows

414
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,480
 I don't know Emily and Andrew what did I do Ryan okay see I don't think we've done

415
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,120
 I don't think we've done I don't think we've done favorite Christmas films so we could do that as a

416
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,960
 pic if you want yeah we could do that unless you guys have pics you actually want to do

417
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,200
 Alison what's your thought I've put advent of code I'm um oh yeah that's good job I'm see that's

418
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,840
 kind of what I want to do and I'm looking down timeouts best Christmas films and I'm going on Jesus

419
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,440
 Christ I hate all of all right let's just do a Christmasy thing there's there's something about

420
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:11,760
 the combination of sentimentality and I don't know just I know it's just the combination of

421
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,360
 sentimentality and sentimentality that causes me to really dislike all the Christmas films

422
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:23,520
 hello all right don't you have some kind of Christmasy pic then we can just be Christmasy fiend

423
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,760
 yeah I mean advent of code is Christmasy yeah that's what I mean you can do have any code I'll do

424
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,960
 my because Karen John could do something else and it will just be Christmas pics yeah all right

425
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,080
 it's time for our Christmas pics listeners who wants to do their Christmasy pic first I basically

426
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,800
 did not have a new pic for this week and so have changed the entire theme into Christmas pics

427
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,360
 um because John asked me what is my favorite Christmas film and the answer is and always will

428
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,280
 be the mop at Christmas Carol John gone watch the mop at Christmas Carol I can't believe you haven't

429
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,920
 seen it I just love it what's it streaming on I am gonna guess it's on Disney plus but I don't

430
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,480
 currently have a Disney plus sub so someone can check that for me apparently it's on Disney

431
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,120
 plus you're right wait it's Disney in it someone was telling me the other day that I should try and

432
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:15,200
 watch it on VHS because apparently there's like a song that's cut out of the one that's on streaming

433
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:22,800
 oh yes so there is right let me just get this correct I think there is a song which was cut

434
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,640
 um that they put back in for the VHS release and I think they may in fact have put it now back in

435
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,320
 for the whole thing so I think possibly there's like a you know remastered full length version

436
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:42,080
 and so I think the one that's on Disney plus um actually has that one in yes it looks like they do

437
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,120
 excellent okay I'm quite confused because I remember this song being in there like when I

438
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,240
 watched it on the TV mm-hmm but apparently wasn't I can absolutely see where they did it's basically

439
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,760
 a slightly sad song that slows down the middle of the film a lot and you know cuts away from

440
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:05,120
 important bits like jokes about Fossebear but it's fine to have it back in mm okay it's great I

441
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,800
 mean it is one of those films where it feels like no one really thought about it and then it had

442
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,440
 like this resurgence of interest and then it became almost overly a thing to love the Muppet

443
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:20,640
 Christmas Carol but I do watch it most years at Christmas time I love it that's fair my pick is

444
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,840
 advent of code so I like to do I always like to think well what has been occupying my time

445
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:34,080
 I'll just pick that and advent of code is a advent um so there's a coding puzzle for every day in

446
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,480
 December and all of the coding puzzles are kind of Christmassy themed but really they're just coding

447
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:45,200
 puzzles and I every year the same thing happens which is that I started off and I'm having great

448
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,560
 fun and I gradually get bogged down until someday about I don't know the 15th or 16th of December

449
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:58,800
 the necessities of manifesting Christmas overwhelm me and I get stuck and then I never come back to

450
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,040
 it but so far I'm not stuck we're on day 14 and I have done all of them almost all on the day

451
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,480
 you're supposed to do them and there are people out there kind of when it releases at five o'clock

452
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,160
 in the morning UK time there are people out there who are um who immediately type drop the code into

453
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:23,760
 a variety of LLMs and spit out answers and solve it in two seconds and I am not that person so I

454
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,800
 lovingly craft all my code very badly by hand and I have a great time and there are private

455
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,440
 leaderboards one of them is on the fancon.dev server if you are there so we have a advent of code

456
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,200
 channel hidden away somewhere and then I also have a leaderboard somewhere that's just got my family

457
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,680
 and some people on it so so anyway if that's the sort of thing you like it's really really good

458
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,200
 there's been this is the 10th year and they're kind of advertising the fact they'd be doing it for

459
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,320
 10 years it's just one guy who thought this would be a fun thing to do and I think you know he gets

460
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,960
 100,000 people doing it which is quite a lot really and it's good fun. I normally start and give up

461
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,720
 about day three. More I remember that my job is partly writing code and I should probably

462
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:14,560
 do the job bits of code with my code brain. Yeah I um we do we run it for um the students like

463
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,800
 one of the lecturers does like a mince pies an advent of code afternoon at work and I'm always

464
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:28,640
 like oh that's such a good idea. It's a very good idea just don't want to do it on my off time because

465
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:36,080
 like you say Liz I do it a lot on my on time and that is tricky but yeah it is uh

466
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:42,240
 no but it's very good for me because I only kind of code occasionally so doing advent of

467
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:49,840
 codes quite good at kind of keeping all of that keeping some coding brain going and also this

468
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:56,400
 year I've been really good about actually making a little file of helper apps and have helper

469
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,960
 programs and making sure that I've noted down where I nicked algorithms from things like that which

470
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,800
 will be very useful if I ever decided to do any real coding. That is fair. Yeah I kind of think I

471
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,600
 should do it because it's like okay well help you brush up on your code skills because I do

472
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,400
 increasingly less coding and I was like oh I should do it or I should like use it as an excuse to learn

473
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,440
 new language but then I just don't but now I think with the permission of John's colleague

474
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,760
 I'm like still that idea and next year get all the students who want to do coding to sit down and

475
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,000
 puzzle their way through it and improve their coding skills. Nice. I'm actually thinking of

476
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:38,960
 running a retrospective event of code thing starting in January on um on the fancon.dev server in

477
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,680
 its currently non-existent death to productivity section where we just kind of do a puzzle a week

478
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,360
 and say well if you haven't solved it starting from the 2015 one and saying well if you haven't

479
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,080
 solved it then you can solve it and if you have solved it then you can make your solution better

480
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:00,080
 or implement it in brainfuck or whatever you want. Yeah. Because some of my solutions are really ugly

481
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:09,520
 I mean really ugly oh my god. I am gonna pick exit the game advent calendar the missing Hollywood

482
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:16,320
 star. So this is this year's this is this year's advent calendar from the exit game series um

483
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:24,880
 Espanar and I have done the exit advent calendars every year since my friend Josh got me the one in

484
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,120
 2021 for my birthday which was the first one they did which was called the mystery of the ice cave

485
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:38,240
 and so it's basically an advent calendar you got 24 doors um you do the uh puzzles in the doors

486
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:45,200
 you have to solve the puzzle before you can move on to the next puzzle so like they are to get to

487
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,360
 work out what door the next door is you have to have solved the previous door and that is uh

488
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,000
 that is kind of a pleasant way of doing it you can't skip ahead and it comes with like hints and

489
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,880
 stuff if you are struggling but yeah they're really good um this year's I feel like has been

490
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,800
 easier than previous years but the theming is great um so I have been enjoying it very much

491
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,040
 and yeah they're like 30 quid 35 quid which for like 24 kind of puzzles that you do over the course

492
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:19,920
 of christmas it was very lovely and um I'm often as discussed I'm often away uh a conference in

493
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:27,040
 December so um it's bany and I do it through like texting and cam photos that is banya sends me and

494
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:33,600
 like or the odd FaceTime um and it's very good and yeah and in this year's one there's one where

495
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,160
 you have to use they give you an elastic band and you have to make the box into a musical instrument

496
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,480
 and that was very fun it was it's good they're really nice that I would highly commend them to

497
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,280
 anyone who likes um puzzle games and yeah it's just it's very lovely I should say that 20

498
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:55,600
 adverts of code is 24 puzzles that you do over the advert period and it is free but it's coding

499
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:02,560
 it's just coding yeah like it as as previously mentioned coding is my day job yeah for for

500
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,280
 but no it's it's good did you see anything about the mop it christmas carol apart from

501
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,400
 it's the mop it christmas part carol I mean not really it's it's a mop it christmas carol it's

502
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,960
 great it's like the christmas carol but with mop it's yeah Alison have you seen the mop it christmas

503
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,640
 carol it's got Michael Kane in it um it's on my list I found out where it was streaming

504
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,960
 I didn't realize I needed to explain the mop it christmas carol because I just assumed everyone

505
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,800
 has seen it it is a really quite faithful retelling of um the Dickens christmas carol

506
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:38,080
 except apart from Michael Kane who is screwed uh they're all mopets it's basically it and it's

507
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,680
 got a few songs and it's good I'm familiar um it sounds like I'm more familiar with it than

508
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,360
 Alison is but I need to watch it this year I think I mean if you've ever seen that trend on social

509
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:54,560
 media for you know take a movie and replace all but one actor with mop it's that's basically

510
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,000
 because that's what the mop it christmas carol is you've just got Michael Kane and everyone else

511
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,800
 is mop it and it's never owned and no sorry that's wrong because um Michael Kane's like

512
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:09,600
 Scrooge's family are also humans I guess otherwise that would be like complicated uh questions that

513
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,000
 you don't really want to go into in a christmas carol yeah that's it it's like it's never questioned

514
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:23,040
 why you know why why are all Scrooge's bookkeepers frogs frog mopets they just are and it has like

515
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:29,520
 uh Dickens is the narrator so the great grandzo plays Charles Dickens as like the narrator

516
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,320
 who knows what's going to happen because he wrote the book which is just an excellent conceit

517
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:42,400
 yeah now I'm um I am it is on the list to watch this year I will be watching it uh a dear dear

518
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,560
 friend has also told me that I must watch it this year so I shall I'm looking forward to it I would

519
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,880
 suggest we just sit and watch it together don't like simultaneously except that I have let my

520
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,840
 Disney+ sublaps and it isn't working in the UK anyway so ah right that was the Octothorpe

521
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:05,680
 podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me and Merry Christmas

522
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,280
 ho ho ho

523
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:27,760
 [Music]

524
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,600
 I had a really weird hydration drink today where they came and gave me a little free sample of

525
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,800
 something which smelled like apples but did not at all taste of apples when you taste it it was

526
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,800
 just water it was freaky oh I think they were saying if you like drinking sweet fizzy drinks

527
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,280
 this will help you drink more water but it's like what I already drink a lot of water it's just

528
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,880
 weird when it smells like apple flavor if I can find a link I will put it in the show notes okay

529
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,960
 that makes sense probably cut all that out as being excess hydration checked no that's the after

530
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:08,080
 show the hydration chat definitely not blocked a hydropyloxer bloody hell how does it be no one

531
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:15,840
 knows I'm 25 episodes octa-thorf hydration quarter we already had gamers corner today as well we're

532
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:22,880
 on a roll yep we're can we get to four corners can we be square no one knows the theme music for
