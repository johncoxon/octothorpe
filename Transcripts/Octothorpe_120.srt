1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
 We do and I think we are vaguely organized and I put people's names in front of letters.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,120
 Randomly.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,400
 Randomly? What?

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,080
 Well, in a sort of semi-order but not with any particular thought.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,800
 Oh, I see what you mean. I thought you'd just like matched random names to random letters and it's like, well, a spaniel wrote in.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,560
 [laughs]

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,280
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 120th episode of OctaThor for

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,360
 Podcast for Science Fiction and Science Fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 10th of October 2024.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,560
 I'm John Coxon.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,960
 I'm Alison Scott.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,160
 And I'm Liz Batty.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,640
 And we're starting with some letters of comments.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,400
 But not as many as last week.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,280
 True.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,120
 So my wife told me that Dev Patel has said he isn't interested in being James Bond.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,920
 Sorry Liz.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,280
 What about M?

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,840
 Right, OK, I don't know if they went through a full roster.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,520
 [laughs]

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,600
 Ispania right in.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,240
 Every letter of the alphabet, test him.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,200
 But presumably if he said he wasn't interested in being James Bond, that was so that the people from James Bond would get in touch and say, can we offer you more money?

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,760
 I don't want the second guest, Dev Patel's methods.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,800
 Yeah, that's what politicians do is to have no interest in becoming Prime Minister.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,760
 It's like, why are you in this game then?

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,960
 Chris Garcia writes, "Hello Chris."

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,800
 You never write.

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,400
 Another close parenthesis for Alison as she left another one open, did I?

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,920
 I think we did have multiple people report this.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,040
 So I think yes.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,680
 I didn't notice this at all.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,200
 I have not noticed this now twice, but I'm inferring that you did it again.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,640
 Oh no.

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,240
 So do another close quickly.

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,920
 Close parenthesis.

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,120
 So listeners, what I'm going to recommend is don't.

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,520
 So this is the 120 episode I've done with Alison.

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,120
 And I have learned that Alison has a lot of wisdom in her head, but imposing your

39
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,560
 strictures on how that information should be structured or delivered will only lead

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,720
 to insanity listeners.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,480
 You've got to reach Zen.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,800
 I recommend Zen.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,280
 I recommend clipping out the little bit of audio where Alison says close parenthesis

44
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,760
 and just like keeping it on your phone in case you need it in an emergency.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,560
 Good plan.

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,800
 I'll put that in B3 in the show, those listeners, for anyone who needs

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 Alison to close a parenthesis, that will be available to you.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,880
 Yeah, no, I'm going to.

49
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,240
 This is going to happen in a bar at some point, isn't it?

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,480
 Anyway, what Chris says is I have in fact full archives of several podcasts,

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,240
 including Dr.

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,480
 Thorpe, some I've even less ought to transcribe.

53
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,520
 So he's got his own transcripts of his own podcasts.

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,000
 I got to I am going to digress now.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,840
 I'm not going to say open parenthesis because that will be bad.

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,760
 I got a paper fancy that the first this week, you know who it's from that says

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,040
 this is not available on PDF.

58
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,400
 So I wrote to the people and immediately said, can I have a PDF?

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,240
 And they were like, no.

60
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,280
 And I was like, OK, so you know how much I've got to do?

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,480
 Some of it just for you.

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,480
 I have to now unstable this fanzine, stick it through my scanner,

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,440
 source to allow it into scanned pages and then restapled it and dropped it

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,480
 in the fanfans box.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,320
 And you could save me 20 minutes of work by sending me a PDF.

66
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,240
 And they were like, no, it's a point of principle.

67
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,440
 So there we go.

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,600
 You know who you are.

69
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
 Thank you for the paper fancy.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,520
 I very much appreciated it.

71
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,720
 Chris also says on recusal's, I'm leaning towards that they are a bad idea

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
 for an absent part of nomination.

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,160
 We should be celebrating the best.

74
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,840
 If you're really uncomfortable repeating, just decline the nomination when it comes.

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
 I disagree with you there.

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,440
 Sorry.

77
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,720
 I don't think it's right to have our people waste their nominations.

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,160
 If we know when I go to decline it.

79
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,000
 That's fair.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,280
 I have listened to the business meeting episode at least three times.

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,400
 The kids enjoyed it as well, at least twice.

82
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,320
 I mean, did the kids listen three times?

83
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,160
 So Tammy Cox and left us a Facebook message, which dovetails neatly with that.

84
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,960
 In which she said something spinning off of Meg's lot of class episode as well.

85
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,280
 She says, count me as one who would be sad if I were to talk permanently recused.

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,520
 I'm a con runner, but not much of a consumer as ever.

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
 SFF media.

88
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,600
 I'm not aware of other fan casters that focus on fandom in the way I thought

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:09,960
 does.

90
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
 And that's why I like it so much.

91
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,840
 Nominating or to book is something I can do to indicate that I find this kind

92
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,000
 of content valuable.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,480
 And maybe that would encourage others to start similar podcasts.

94
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,520
 But if there's never anything like it on the ballot, that's one less signal that

95
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,120
 there's demand.

96
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,240
 And that is a good point, Terry, and very kind.

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,120
 So thank you.

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,000
 We also had from Farrah on Facebook saying, I think one should win three times

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,760
 consecutively before accusing oneself, which is also an interesting way of doing

100
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:33,880
 it.

101
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,560
 Basically, the point that you start to dominate the category, that is when you

102
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,920
 should graciously step back.

103
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,800
 I think that also is the thing where I wonder if we're going to get like,

104
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,960
 I think we've kind of been thinking about things like Ansible and Locusts and

105
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,920
 some very, very long running fanzines and fan writers.

106
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,040
 Fan casters knew enough that not many fan customer running for years and years

107
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,400
 and years.

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,120
 I mean, I think there is like writing excuses, but they were in best related work.

109
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,600
 There is Verity, which is always somewhere bubbling under on the ballot.

110
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,960
 But I can't think of many things which kind of have been going for, you know,

111
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,480
 10 years.

112
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,440
 Emily of January wrote and said, I missed your postbag episode, but have some

113
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,840
 thoughts anyway, which is fine.

114
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,600
 Alan Bond didn't get the DDH title until the convention, but they were

115
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,720
 acting as committee for much before that.

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,680
 So that happened in practice.

117
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,040
 John suggested that the online convention should be part of promotions,

118
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,080
 but Emily suggested it probably touches all parts of the convention.

119
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,600
 So needs to have people from all different areas of the convention.

120
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,880
 I mean, I'm kind of like it's, it's a convention like the in person

121
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,240
 convention is a convention.

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,080
 And anyway, it is, I think I probably agree with this to some extent.

123
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,800
 I think it is still the fact that there are a lot of people involved in

124
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,960
 Worldcon running who think that the online convention is something that can

125
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,160
 be put in a box is something that slightly bothers me.

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,560
 I think if you're working on a Worldcon, every job should have this

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,640
 sense of and how does that work online?

128
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,720
 Perhaps not the person who's responsible for negotiating with the SEC

129
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,680
 so they don't do bag checks, but you know, everybody else.

130
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,360
 And then a thing on formatting and saying, oh, but if you are going to use

131
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,720
 print formats, you should have use re flowable ones.

132
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,320
 I understand that fandom is attached to PDFs, but they are awful to zoom

133
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,920
 around and scroll on your phone.

134
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,360
 And I mean, I understand where Emily is coming from here.

135
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,160
 I am probably always going to be the person who thinks that beautiful print

136
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,960
 publications are lovely.

137
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,720
 But then I guess I also used to like 12 inch record sleeves.

138
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
 Look where that got me.

139
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,120
 I think we'll see a resurgence of interest in beautifully formatted

140
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,200
 print publications in the same way that the young people apparently buy

141
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,280
 vinyl records.

142
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,600
 I think the point about needing people to think about how it touches the

143
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,840
 physical convention and the online convention is probably true, like down

144
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,240
 the road.

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,880
 But I do think like three years on is probably too soon to expect that to

146
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,600
 have been completely embedded in everyone's brains at a level where you

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,360
 just don't need to have anyone worrying about it anymore.

148
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,840
 Like, I think I think that's going to be a I would I would guess that won't

149
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,040
 be true for years and years because we have done this thing in this way for

150
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,880
 over 80 years and it takes a long time to unlearn those habits.

151
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,800
 So I don't I think I think in the long, long run, you're right.

152
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,680
 But in the short term, I don't see it happening soon.

153
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,560
 But yeah, it's a timescale argument more than anything else.

154
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,760
 And John's timescale argument also applies to publications, right?

155
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,600
 Like we have made the shift from we provide everyone at the con with a paper

156
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,040
 thing to we expect them to use their device of whatever size to look at

157
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,680
 important content while they're at the con, but maybe not quite got the hang

158
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,080
 of providing that in the right format.

159
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,000
 And at some point, someone will be like, OK, this is not primarily a print

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,760
 thing. This is primarily information and we put it into the format.

161
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,400
 It needs to be, but we haven't quite got that.

162
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,560
 But in 10 years, I think we will.

163
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,480
 Maybe five.

164
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,120
 How optimistic are we feeling?

165
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,960
 I don't know.

166
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,520
 It depends on the day, Liz.

167
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,360
 I didn't sleep well.

168
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,880
 So less than usual.

169
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,720
 We also heard from noted science fiction critic Abigail Nusbaum, who

170
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,360
 email does what I think is a spoiler for the acolyte.

171
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,440
 So anyone who hasn't watched the acolyte yet and doesn't want to know the twist,

172
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,960
 say your fingers and your ears.

173
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,200
 Alison has in fact done this.

174
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,360
 Alison, take your headphones off and I will wave at you and it's time to put

175
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,960
 them back on Abigail the email is to say she's honored to be known as

176
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
 appreciated of Mani Gittinto's arms.

177
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,440
 It is a Star Wars show that finally figured out how to make the dark side of

178
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,440
 the force a seductive to its audience as it apparently is to characters within

179
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,080
 the universe and the key to that turns out to be arms.

180
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,280
 I mean, correct.

181
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,000
 I don't know about John, but I would probably go to the dark side for

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,920
 Mani Gittinto's arms.

183
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,880
 I do have a ribbon from my first Gallifrey one convention that says I heard

184
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,960
 Kylo Ren was shredded.

185
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,240
 I heard he had an eight pack.

186
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,040
 So, you know, it's not only Mani Gissino, who is a hot dark side user.

187
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
 Our Adam Driver is quite pretty.

188
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:59,080
 Hugo Girl in their report from Glasgow talked a little bit about us in in that

189
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,040
 episode, namely a report from the Hugo reception and a report from our live

190
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,000
 panel. If you're interested in what that was like, go listen to that episode.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,840
 I think it's the most recent episode as we record, but it might not be when you

192
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,800
 download this.

193
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,120
 But yeah, no, it was very sweet and it made me smile.

194
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,040
 And thank you to Laurie and Kevin for being me and Espani's plus ones for the

195
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,560
 reception because it was very lovely to have such beautiful dates.

196
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,600
 And also for being my airport buddies.

197
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,680
 Yes.

198
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,880
 Makes the con less longer when you just basically tap someone until they have to

199
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,200
 run away and get on a plane like the very end of the con.

200
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,320
 Yep, yup, yup.

201
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,680
 We also heard from Nicholas White, who points out that there's an eclipse in

202
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,640
 Spain before the one in Australia.

203
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,280
 So if you're a fan of eclipses, go look that up.

204
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,640
 Listeners will put link in the three notes.

205
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,240
 We also heard from Ivan Sinha, who has discovered that at sea, the pineapple is

206
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,960
 the universal symbol of the swinger.

207
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,720
 And therefore, the pre-support for Brisbane being pineapple could be quite

208
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,560
 funny.

209
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,600
 Brisbane, right in.

210
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
 Yeah, Brisbane, were you making a secret coded message about swinging or is it

211
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,200
 just that you pick some food?

212
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,400
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.

213
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,440
 Where are you?

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,400
 Where are you?

215
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,360
 Newcastle.

216
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,040
 No, no, I'm wrong.

217
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,560
 Ignore me.

218
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,080
 Talking, talking rots right now.

219
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,760
 So I thought the big pineapple was in Brisbane, but it's not.

220
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,240
 So what could have been a really interesting point is, oh, you were going to

221
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
 say there was a giant pineapple thing.

222
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,200
 Yeah, but OK.

223
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,440
 Yeah, there is a big pineapple, but it's not in Brisbane.

224
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,480
 So I was going to say, oh, but the big pineapple is a noted feature of Brisbane.

225
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,280
 And what does that tell us about the walk on?

226
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,600
 So, you know, but it's not.

227
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,320
 But it is in Queensland, which is nowhere near Brisbane.

228
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,560
 Brisbane is the capital city of Queensland.

229
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,600
 So I assume that it is in it.

230
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 OK, maybe it's in Brisbane.

231
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,200
 Hang on.

232
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,480
 And I know that Australians have a different perspective of what is near to

233
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,280
 things than we do on account of how their island is way bigger than ours.

234
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
 Yes, it is.

235
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,400
 It is close to Brisbane.

236
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,240
 And it's about 150 miles away.

237
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,960
 That's close to Brisbane, even by a British perspective.

238
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,040
 It's probably because of the big pineapple.

239
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,160
 So it's pineapples because the big pineapple is a noted symbol of Brisbane.

240
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,120
 And I hesitate to think what that tells us about Brisbane, Fandom.

241
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,480
 And I know that Pat McMurry was very taken with the big pineapple on his fan

242
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,080
 fund trip.

243
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,120
 So I hesitate to think what that tells us about Pat.

244
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,360
 I think it means that the Australian Worldcon is going to take some big swings.

245
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,840
 [Music]

246
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,400
 Do we want to do Hugo Stats?

247
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,760
 I am prepared for doing Hugo Stats, I think.

248
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,600
 For those people who were sad that Liz does not get enough airtime.

249
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,320
 Ho-ho listeners, do we have an episode for you?

250
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,080
 Yes.

251
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,920
 Activate Liz.

252
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,160
 And it's amazing it's taken us this long to get to doing it on the show.

253
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,960
 But straight after the Hugo's, we got Stats, which is quite funny when I went

254
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,320
 to get a drink and came back to a whole group of people just like with their

255
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,400
 heads buried in their smartphones, checking out Stats.

256
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,280
 And there's some interesting things in the Stats.

257
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,560
 So let's talk about them.

258
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,640
 So as we've discussed before, nominees are, well, finalists for Hugo's are

259
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,760
 generated using E-pluribus Hugo, the quite complicated method of giving you like

260
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,240
 a set of points for your nominations, which gets split over all the nominees

261
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,600
 you've put on and then they get removed and then they get reallocated.

262
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,880
 Anyway, if you want a long description of how it works, I'm pretty sure I've

263
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,800
 done it before on the podcast or we'll link to one in the show notes.

264
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,000
 But the interesting thing is this means that you can be on the ballot.

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,200
 Like you can be in the top six without getting the sixth highest number of

266
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,080
 nominations or whatever.

267
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,200
 This year, there are quite a lot finalists who were helped by E-pluribus Hugo

268
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,560
 to get on the ballot because they obviously did not share a strong voting

269
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,440
 constituency with anything else on the ballot.

270
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,440
 And in some cases, this might be an indication that because the

271
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,880
 nominators from Chengdu maybe nominated different things than the

272
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,480
 nominators from the UK and the US.

273
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,280
 And so there's a few instances of this.

274
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,440
 For instance, if you go to Best Short Story without E-P-H, there would have

275
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,040
 been a joint sixth nominee, which was another, I think originally,

276
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,360
 Chinese story called Heaven's Vol by Lu Guicha.

277
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,080
 And if you go to Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form, where as we know,

278
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,080
 there was a motion to extend the eligibility for Godzilla minus one.

279
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,920
 And as we later found out, it got the same number of votes as poor things.

280
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,280
 And so it was sort of knocked out there by E-P-H.

281
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,880
 But actually, the Wandering Earth 2 got fewer actual votes than Godzilla

282
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,440
 minus one and good Omen series two and the Marvels and Asteroid City and

283
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,680
 Guardians of Galaxy Vol 3.

284
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,160
 But because of E-P-H, it seems like the people who nominated the Wandering

285
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,560
 Earth 2 mostly just nominated Wandering Earth 2, whereas the people who

286
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,040
 nominated the other things probably split there, like they had multiple

287
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,720
 successful finalists on the ballot.

288
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,560
 So that really helped the Wandering Earth, which otherwise, you know, would have

289
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,480
 not been anywhere near the ballot.

290
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,160
 And how many how many votes did how many nominations did Wandering Earth 2 get?

291
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,760
 There's 69.

292
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
 Nice.

293
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,160
 Low right.

294
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,960
 I might be 35, but I'm 12 at heart.

295
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:06,600
 And there are a few other examples of this worth noting Nicholas also explicitly

296
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,320
 notes Godzilla minus one would have needed one more vote and it would have been

297
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,840
 on the ballot.

298
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,560
 Yes.

299
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,560
 So it was it was you can tell it's very close to the tables, but Nicholas does

300
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,600
 do a good job of pulling out little things that are not necessarily clear and

301
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,480
 just highlighting them for the reader.

302
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,040
 Yeah, because if it had one more vote, then it would not have been in the final

303
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,560
 runoff.

304
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,560
 I think Nicholas knows Nicholas knows all the details.

305
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,560
 There were a few other instances of like where a nominee got on with a

306
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,760
 slightly lower number of nominations due to E-P-H.

307
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,520
 I think Godzilla minus one is the biggest example, but for instance,

308
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,280
 Yao Hijun is on the ballot for a better long form, just by getting one fewer

309
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,280
 nomination than Gillian Redfern, although this did say that Gillian would have

310
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,880
 needed another five votes to get on the ballot.

311
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,160
 It was not quite as close.

312
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,240
 We also see this in best fanzine.

313
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,120
 And in this case, I don't think this is due to a Chinese nominating block.

314
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,880
 This is because idea made it onto the ballot, but the idea actually got fewer

315
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,240
 nominations than answer review books, which I nominated,

316
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,240
 Galactic Journey and Zero Gravity News, both previous finalists.

317
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,640
 So that's another case of that idea is an example of something that gets a lot

318
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,960
 of votes from people who are not otherwise voting for anything, because

319
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,680
 they don't actually read or like the other things in the category, or they

320
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,960
 like read and like other fanzines, but they're not the fanzines that are on the

321
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,440
 ballot.

322
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,880
 If you nominate something and other things that are not in contention, then

323
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,400
 your nomination has more power under EPH.

324
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,800
 Yeah.

325
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,640
 So for instance, you can see that when banana wings is eliminated,

326
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,240
 idea picks up quite a lot of points.

327
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,960
 And some of the others do pick up points, but not nearly as many.

328
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,960
 So clearly, a bunch of those points are going to idea.

329
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,840
 Oh, is this a good place for me to talk about?

330
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
 Thank you, diagrams.

331
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,800
 And yeah, this is basically showing the like the immutable artifact

332
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,440
 fanzine community and the it's on the internet as a HTML fanzine community,

333
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,560
 which any better snappy names for, you can see the two communities both

334
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,080
 nominating with remarkably little overlap.

335
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,480
 But yeah, it's interesting.

336
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,880
 I think the overlap is in Journey Planet.

337
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,080
 Yes, but even then not loads, although definitely some.

338
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,080
 But like, certainly when the rec center comes out, none of those people

339
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,880
 transfer to Journey Planet, whereas when Galactic Journey comes out, a few do.

340
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,800
 It's interesting.

341
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,480
 It is interesting.

342
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,920
 And we're not going to call them archaic and modern fanzines were agreed,

343
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,440
 dare I?

344
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,040
 I used, I didn't, I don't think retro has a value judgement in the way

345
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,280
 you think it does, but I understand the point.

346
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,000
 It's like retro games.

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,440
 I play a lot of retro games.

348
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,320
 Oh, yeah.

349
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,640
 Might be talking about that a bit later.

350
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
 For Shadow Week.

351
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,240
 The game convention I just went to had several mega drives for sale at 50

352
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,880
 quid each, including all cables.

353
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,520
 And I was like, what's old is new again.

354
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,440
 Well, I'm guessing, and I mean to a category with arguably no one retro

355
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,520
 because it's fan cast.

356
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,400
 And I already talked about how there are no, you know, fan cast from the 60s

357
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,680
 unless you can't work cylinders, see previous episodes.

358
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,720
 Anyway, the nominations in fan cast were interesting given that the two

359
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,880
 nominees with by far the most number of nominations were both eligible due to

360
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,320
 being professional and indeed, Discovery X didn't end up in the finalists.

361
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,160
 But also interesting that Hugo Girl were pretty close to making the ballot.

362
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,120
 And if Antman EPH, they would have been on there despite having deemed

363
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,520
 themselves to be ineligible.

364
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,200
 So those 30 people, unfortunately, like, yeah, they would have an example of what

365
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,040
 we were talking about earlier that you would have got your nominee onto

366
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,240
 ballot and then they would have declined.

367
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,960
 So yeah, you'd have got your nominee onto the ballot without I assert

368
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,680
 listening to the podcast where they'd clearly recused.

369
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,960
 Recuse early, recuse often because you might not listen to every single episode.

370
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,640
 Yeah, indeed.

371
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,800
 There's tricky, right?

372
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,480
 Because we don't encourage people during Hugo season, we are going to have to say at

373
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,680
 the start of every episode that we have recused because anyone who starts

374
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,520
 listening during Hugo season, we are going to feel just start and listen, right?

375
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,840
 And so we can't then be like, well, why didn't you listen to the back catalog

376
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,920
 when we repeatedly tell people they don't know, you know, like, it is hard.

377
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,640
 It is hard.

378
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,160
 The thing I love about this is that when Hugo Girl gets taken out, you can see

379
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,280
 that like four points get transferred to Octa thought.

380
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,400
 So there is a

381
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,160
 Oh, thank you, chaps.

382
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,680
 Big Venn diagram there, which makes sense because we are transatlantic

383
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,320
 podcast besties, but it's still lovely to see it in actual numbers.

384
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,680
 The first time we got on the Hugo Baller, EPH did us a massive solid.

385
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,840
 And this time we are like, yes, yeah, I won't go into it too much because it makes

386
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,760
 me want to curl up and cringe into a little ball, but it is very nice.

387
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,760
 Then that's that's people.

388
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,200
 So what else say something so I don't have to do that voice anymore?

389
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,160
 Yeah, let's move on.

390
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,040
 I'm cringing and killing a flippable listening to that voice, actually.

391
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,560
 Yeah.

392
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,560
 So just the other two instances where someone made it on the ballot by EPH this year

393
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,920
 were all hand-westering in fan writer and also Dan Taylor is in fan artists,

394
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,320
 but they are both very close and indeed in fan artists, you may need it.

395
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,760
 Not point eight more points. So like, you know, that's one or two nominations.

396
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,640
 So very close, but also there's a pretty low number of nominations still in fan

397
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
 artist, not your fan artists.

398
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,680
 And it is interesting.

399
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,920
 Fan artists is one of the categories where the highest number of nominations is not a

400
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,600
 good predictor of who eventually won, which I think is something will probably come to

401
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,520
 later on in this discussion for shadowing.

402
00:19:42,480 --> 00:20:03,600
 More shadowing, but now all the Alison get word in Ed

403
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,880
 on used for the hugos before. And it makes it very clear where the votes are going in the,

404
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,080
 in the process. And I thought this was interesting. And we have a link.

405
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,160
 The person in question was Zoe O'Connell, who I believe is a listener.

406
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,320
 Certainly they are in our Facebook community.

407
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
 Hello.

408
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,560
 Hello, Zoe. So that is great. And I love these and I looked at them a lot.

409
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,200
 And I particularly looked at the octave thought while.

410
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,920
 Because, you know, what am I like? But I thought it was very interesting because it does present

411
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,800
 this information in graphical form, which is quite nice.

412
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:47,360
 Yeah, no, it does. So Zoe credits Alexandra lanes for the idea in the last post in the chain,

413
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,040
 which we'll put a link to in the show notes listeners.

414
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:57,120
 And so if I have had thoughts of volunteering to help with the Hugo administration team for Seattle,

415
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,160
 because we will be recused, so there'll be no conflict of interest.

416
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,200
 And this is the sort of thing I would, I've always thought it would be nice to see more

417
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,160
 visualizations in the actual tables. Because one of the things I repeatedly tell PhD students at

418
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,560
 work is don't put tables in your papers because it's really difficult to read a table and draw

419
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,360
 any meaningful conclusions, which I'm thinking very hard and graphs to let you highlight stuff

420
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,760
 really well. But yeah, no, these are absolutely amazing.

421
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,680
 I have a couple comments. One is definitely also put the tables in the paper though, John.

422
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
 Then I can steal the data from them.

423
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,400
 Oh, yeah, yeah. No, no, no. Well, you put the tables in.

424
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,920
 Well, actually, no. Okay, so we're not allowed to put the tables in the paper anymore, Liz.

425
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,520
 We have to put them on a separate data repository.

426
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,480
 Yeah, that's also fair. NIRDY NIRDS NIRDS.

427
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,680
 Yeah. So it's the woman who put, oh, look at these beautiful visualizations and diagrams into the

428
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:53,280
 show notes. We're not out learning on this one. I am however, going to out-nerdy both by saying

429
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,320
 that actually the first Sanqui diagrams I saw for the Hugo Awards are in 2020 by a Twitter user

430
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,080
 called Martin P. I don't know how they made them. Oh, it looks like they use Sanqui Matics.

431
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,080
 So the same tool that Zouio Connell has used, which I've also used to make Sanqui diagrams,

432
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,760
 but I think the great idea was to like suck all the stats out of the Hugo Minestrator's report

433
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,680
 and write a Python script to feed them in Sanqui Matics, which is great because I had once tried

434
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:27,200
 to automate the making of Sanqui diagrams through R and found just the most complicated packages

435
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,280
 I'd ever seen in my life. So it looks like Sanqui Matics is the way to go. I will put a link in

436
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,800
 the show notes to the 2021s, which are quite fun. We probably missed them because we're having a

437
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,680
 pandemic at the time, you know, so yeah. Looking at like Python options for Sanqui diagrams, the

438
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,920
 Matplotlib ones look absolutely awful. And then you have to go to other packages and they look very

439
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,600
 complicated. So yeah, you might be getting into the weeds. Maybe. Although I will say

440
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,360
 that the ones you can make in Python, let you have interactive HTML ones with tooltips. So

441
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,800
 if you were going to do the EPH ones, that might be super good. But but but it's all going on a PDF

442
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,880
 anyway. So there's no reason that the Hugo stats have to be in a PDF, you know, they could be in

443
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,800
 a sensible day of format. Sorry, it's oh, there's a good reason for having them in a PDF. Well,

444
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,200
 they should also be in a PDF, but they should also be in HTML with CSV files that you can read in

445
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,160
 and do hacking with. But no, good. Thank you diagrams. Very good. Zoey. Thank you very much for this,

446
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,200
 because it is wonderful. And we love data. Now Liz, you what did you want to do things about

447
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,320
 the relationship of nominations to winners? There's also because the preferential vote,

448
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,600
 you can get winners in the who goes who do not have the most first preferences. And you sometimes

449
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,640
 get interesting voting patterns. And just to pull out a few in best novella seeds of mercury,

450
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,840
 which had quite a lot of nominations, but not the most has like a pretty whopping advantage in first

451
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,600
 preferences. It has like 280 more than the next nearest, which is Donhenge. But as you watch all

452
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,320
 the preferences get redistributed, basically these mercury only manage to gain about 200. And

453
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,840
 Donhenge gains like an extra 680 votes. So basically, Donhenge ends up coming from behind on the second

454
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,480
 to last round and winning it, which I thought was quite interesting. And you do get that in a few

455
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,000
 other, few other categories as well. That's one I was going to pull out. So the other one that's

456
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,240
 noticeable is three body problem is winning in best graphic story, quite comfortably again until

457
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,160
 the final round where when all the preferences get redistributed, it is saga again. And three body

458
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,400
 problem also got nominated with like five times as many nominations as the next nearest nominee.

459
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,760
 That was a pretty whopping. It's not only a giant kind of set of nominations, but also it has 151

460
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,640
 points from 151 nominators throughout the last 10 rounds, basically. So no one nominated three

461
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,600
 body problem nominated anything else that made it so final well. Dungeons and Dragons. I mean,

462
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,600
 we haven't had a chance to talk about Dungeons and Dragons, but it was a weird winner, wasn't it?

463
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,760
 So Spiderman had was had the most first round votes. There's not a huge amount in it above

464
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,720
 Dungeons and Dragons. And it carried on having the first votes right until the point where

465
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:17,520
 Barbie got eliminated and Barbie's extra votes were enough to make the difference and tip D&D

466
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,240
 to the top. So people who like Barbie like D&D better than they like Spiderman. I don't know if

467
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,960
 I think that's even likely to be true. Yeah, it's interesting because D&D did get the most

468
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,240
 nominations. So like it is interesting that that it ended up winning and got the most

469
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,440
 nominations, which was not true in every category. But I mean, I think these are examples of why

470
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,480
 it's important to have a ranked preference ballot and not just first post post because yeah,

471
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,720
 I love I love that D&D one. I mean, I did like this movie, but I'm not sure it was the better

472
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,280
 but it's not the best of the year. Poor things was best of the year. But I absolutely love

473
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:00,080
 that it won because I love that there was kind of an everyone was shocked and it beat out a lot of

474
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,840
 much bigger, bigger films because you know, nerds be nerdy. It was very old Brad for the

475
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,400
 World Card, I thought. It's fine, but it's not like, you know, it's a small independent production

476
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,400
 that makes it because no, it's like which one of these like top, I guess the top three are all

477
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,920
 big budget Hollywood films. It's more like poor things basically get smashed by bigger budget

478
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,560
 productions. That's just the motor, I think. Yeah, but pneumonia being streaming only

479
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:34,000
 possibly hurt it a bit if people hadn't picked it up. It also had low, it didn't have a lot of

480
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,760
 buzz around it, whereas I think all of the other movies here did have quite a bit of buzz. I think

481
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,080
 that's to do with theatrical release, if I'm honest. I think the theatrical releases do quite a lot

482
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:49,600
 for buzz for movies and I don't fully understand Netflix's model in terms of building excitement

483
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,360
 for properties in that sense, but you know, I'm not in charge. Netflix certainly never told me to

484
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,520
 watch it. I mean, it was a weird one anyway because Netflix kind of picked it up when it was dropped

485
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,200
 partway through by the studio and so on. So yeah, maybe it like they picked it up, but it was not in

486
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,520
 their plans as a big thing to promote. It's great though. So if you didn't watch it, and there are a

487
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,520
 couple of other categories that basically end up being very close. I mean, we're all cheered, I

488
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,480
 think when Strange Horizons was best-selling Proxin, but they did win by six votes and they got it on

489
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,840
 the final, on the final redistribution. Like they were on Kenny Wai-Zing were very close again,

490
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,480
 which is interesting. And yeah, the lead changed in Best Fan Zine three times. Yes, it did. The

491
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:38,400
 Best Fan Zine Sankey is quite interesting. I wanted to do best editor short form, which I found

492
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:45,760
 interesting because Lin and Lin-M and Michael Damian Thomas are winning for the first three rounds,

493
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,800
 and then when Yang Feng is excluded, the redistribution goes to Neil Clark, which I assume is because Neil

494
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:59,440
 has done a lot of work in China, and I assume is him having recognition with Chinese fandom,

495
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,560
 because I'm going to guess Yang Feng had supporters in Chinese fandom. So I thought that was interesting,

496
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,920
 just seeing that effect in the stats. I think it is also worth noting that Discover X, which

497
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,440
 we covered, was kind of had enough votes to be on the ballot in both fan cast and best related work,

498
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,640
 but as it is a professional production, it went in best related work. And as we know,

499
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:28,000
 Discover X was part of the Chengdu science fiction fandom in some way, and it managed to get 343

500
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,480
 nominations, but then when you look at the actual votes in best related work, it got 25 first

501
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,440
 preferences, which was below no award. So that is a pretty dramatic difference. So obviously,

502
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,680
 a lot of people who liked that and had nominating rights from Chengdu, but potentially did not join

503
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:49,840
 Glasgow and so did not have voting rights. So I think that is the only case of a finalist,

504
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,280
 which ends up with fewer first preferences than no award. And I mean, you do sometimes get no

505
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,040
 award a bit higher up, especially if it's in categories where there is just a sort of dedicated

506
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:06,080
 set of people who don't think that the category should exist. And you can see this in best fan cast.

507
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,680
 I do want to thank the one person again, who put no award top and then put a second.

508
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,760
 [Laughter]

509
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,760
 That was a vote for fan cast to not exist, but it does exist, it should be optimal.

510
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,040
 Yeah, I mean, you get that in quite a few categories, right? You get the, I don't think this category

511
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,720
 should exist, but if someone's going to win, I'm going to help choose the winner. And so some of

512
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,320
 their votes do redistribute. There was only that one case where an actual finalist was below.

513
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,160
 No award. That is my hu-kobit.

514
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,080
 A, thank you very much, correspondent Liz.

515
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:45,120
 Do we want to mention Reconnect?

516
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,200
 Reconnect has its PR2 out. It is an extremely beautiful PDF. Sorry, Emily.

517
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,920
 And I think it was one of the Januarys who alerted me to the, I am reading this on my phone and I'm

518
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,920
 like, why would you do that? But I know that a lot of people, the majority of people,

519
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,960
 data, read everything on their phones. So, you know, that's why you would do that. So I guess,

520
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,160
 but anyway, it's lovely, but it has lots of information in it. You should go and find it.

521
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,160
 They are also looking for somebody to run out, run that discord, because Emily and Andrew are

522
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,320
 taking a year off. So I think it would be a good idea for somebody to step up to the plate.

523
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,520
 Someone should do this. I have put a top by someone list. It will not be me.

524
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,120
 There are other things in there as well. I will put a link in the show notes.

525
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,680
 Oh, and hotel bookings are opening. I think they said in September, and I feel like that's not

526
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,200
 going to happen given that we are recording on the 29th, but you know.

527
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,920
 Real soon now. Real soon now. Maybe by the time you get this podcast, because we are recording

528
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,440
 slightly early. The news came out since we last recorded that David Curry, who people might know

529
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,800
 as Jersey Griffin, passed away after an illness. He was listener. He listened for a long time.

530
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,200
 I knew him through East Confandom, and he will be missed. He was lovely bloke.

531
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,600
 And yeah, very sad news. Yeah, he was one of our first regular listeners, I think. Yeah.

532
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:12,080
 Shall we do pics? I could go first, because I know what I'm picking.

533
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,080
 I know what I'm picking. All right. So I'm going to pick. So I'm going to pick.

534
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,120
 I'm not going to pick a thing, and then I'm going to pick a thing in the time-honoured John tradition.

535
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:31,760
 Oh, the thing I'm not picking is a play that I saw in Whitley Bay last night,

536
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,480
 which was called Subterrania. And the reason I'm not picking it is that this is spectacularly

537
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,280
 unhelpful recommendation for two reasons. Firstly, it was playing in Whitley Bay, and secondly,

538
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:47,440
 the last day was yesterday. But it was a really good little local production about a post-apocalyptic

539
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,560
 northeast with people living in the Metro tunnels. And it was just really nice. And I liked it very

540
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:59,840
 much. And I was happy to see a genre piece of local theatre playing. And yeah, really enjoyed it.

541
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,920
 My actual pick is The Substance, which is an incredibly stressful movie that honestly still

542
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,680
 makes me anxious when I think about it now, when I saw it on Wednesday. So that's like five days

543
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:19,200
 ago listeners. It was a lot. It is amazing. It is not subtle. It is absolutely haunting.

544
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,800
 It has like a list of content warnings as long as you're armed, and it's absolutely terrifying

545
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:32,240
 and incredibly gory. I thought it was incredible, mostly how angry it is. There are some people on

546
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,160
 Letterbox to are determined to read it as pro-objectifying women, which I think is a

547
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:44,720
 incomplete reading, I think I would say, because I think, I don't know, it was very

548
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:52,240
 obviously very angry about everything to me. But it was just, it was amazing. And yeah,

549
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,920
 we very much enjoyed it. But do be kind to yourself when you go and see it, because

550
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:05,040
 oh, it was hard. It was real hard. So yeah. And it's genre. It's science fiction. I won't go into

551
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:13,120
 the plot because yeah, but it's a kind of body horror science fiction piece. I wonder whether it'll

552
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,320
 be on the Hugo ballot. I can't decide. It might be a bit much.

553
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,400
 Fun fact listeners, Johnny Badley, noticed that this was the best film at Frightfest this year,

554
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,960
 and noticed that it's got a general release. I noticed that it was the only interesting film

555
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,160
 available for the magical Wednesday afternoon slot at Ascinemo, where two of us can watch a film

556
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,600
 for £6.75, the pair. And I said, should I go and watch this movie? And several people said,

557
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,360
 no, Alison, you should not. And I have put it down for streaming. So watch it streaming,

558
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,800
 possibly in quite small bits to determine whether it should be on my Hugo ballot or not.

559
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,960
 Yeah, I don't. Yeah, you're a horror. You have described yourself as a horror worse.

560
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,440
 I am. I am. And Steven is a bit as well. Yeah. You know, I sort of at the bits in movies where

561
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,800
 I flage, I noticed that Steven flitchers more. So, you know. So, I don't know. But I mean,

562
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,760
 it's obviously a very interesting movie with a lot, a lot to go on, but it's probably not quite

563
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:21,760
 my cup of tea. It'll be a bit scary for me. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I think it's a masterpiece.

564
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,880
 I will never watch it ever again, because it is too stressful. So, you know.

565
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:39,040
 Anyway, someone else can do a pic. So my pic is UFO 50. I mentioned retro games earlier,

566
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,120
 and this is a game which is out this week. The premise of the game is it's a collection like

567
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:50,560
 Atari 50 that collects together all of the greatest games of a particular console. In this case,

568
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,240
 the LX, an 80s console that existed in three generations from 1982 to 1989. So, the 50 games

569
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,400
 go from the earliest game released on the console and it has to the last one. And the thing about

570
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,120
 this is that the LX, the games and all the developers listed in the game never existed,

571
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:17,280
 and all of the and all of these games are new. They all have the hardware constraints of the

572
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,800
 non-existent console. So, it has a 384 by 216 screen with 32 bits of color and a four-way

573
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,760
 controller with with a and B buttons. This is a game for steam. It's produced by Derek Yu,

574
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,360
 who did Spelunky and brought in his old childhood mate, John Perry, who is now a board game designer

575
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:46,320
 known for spots amongst other things and Airland and Sea. They also brought in the designer of

576
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,600
 Aduro from Oto, who designed Downwell and Point P, if you know those games, and then they have

577
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:58,560
 some ex probably the best chip tune composer working in the industry, Eric Sucra, and then there's a

578
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,080
 couple of actual developers who probably did all the hard work of developing this game.

579
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,160
 The games, like in the 80s, the games come in a huge range of genres. So, some of them

580
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,920
 really quite in keeping of real games of the time, and some of them kind of use modern

581
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,400
 tropes. So, for example, there is a deck builder in here, and there is a tower defense in here,

582
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,440
 and there are a lot of games that did not in fact exist at the time. The very first game of the

583
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,560
 collection, Babuta, is they, I guess they knew that people would play it first, but it's supposed

584
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,960
 to be the very oldest game. So, it's really janky, it's got no music, there's a kind of little glitchy

585
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,480
 noise when you change screens, the character travels very slowly, and a lot of people are kind of

586
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,080
 bounced off this one, and yet if you actually play it, which I have extremely extensively,

587
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,800
 it's fabulous, it's full of secrets, there's lots of extremely cool things about it, and

588
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,840
 and yes, so I played it all week really, that's what I've done, it's I've fallen into a hole,

589
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:03,840
 and then having fallen into the hole, oh, and it's Windows only, so because I've not heard of this

590
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:09,520
 game, but as soon as, I mean it's obviously very much sort of game I like, as soon as I heard about

591
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,720
 it, I said, well I'm buying that, but of course it runs on Windows only under Steam, so I've got,

592
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,920
 I've got all that running under Whiskey, Whiskey is stronger wine, so Whiskey is a wine that

593
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,400
 additionally includes Max Game Port in Kit, so if you're from Mac, this is how you can do this

594
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,560
 with your Steam thing, and I didn't just put it onto my regular Mac, I also then put it onto the

595
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,680
 Mac in the living room, synced by controllers, so we can sit on the sofa playing the console games,

596
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:46,080
 like God intended with our little controllers, and discovered at that point that as well as there

597
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,280
 being 50 games here, which is an enormous number of games, quite a lot of the games have multiplayer,

598
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,040
 and the multiplayer games are not just everyone takes a turn at the single player game, or people

599
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,440
 fight head to head, they are really different, they are interesting takes on how you would do this,

600
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,640
 so one of them is semi-collaborative, because they haven't quite worked out that a collaborative

601
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,000
 game should have one score, one of them is competitive and you can also beat up your,

602
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 beat up the person who is trying to do the thing at the same time as you are, and there's a lot of

603
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,040
 we've only played a couple of them so far, so it's very exciting, and I don't know, I may be sometime,

604
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:26,240
 50 games, 50 games buy some really good retro game designers, it's like, it is like Christmas,

605
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:34,960
 it is like imagine you got at NES and 50 games, oh it's amazing, and people say well it's like the

606
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,400
 experience of having a console and a load and a bunch of games for it for the first time, but it's

607
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,680
 also like, I think the only time I've had an experience quite like this is main, but this is

608
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,360
 better because there's some quality control that didn't really exist when I downloaded main and also

609
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:59,680
 625 dodgy ROMs for it, so all the games, when you read reviews of UFO 50 people are kind of like

610
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,120
 well this was not very good and this was not very good, but I've really got into this one,

611
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:08,240
 and if you read 10 reviews there'll be 10 different games, so fabulous, strongly recommend if you

612
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,640
 like any sort of retro games at all, which obviously I do, because no issue with things like narrative

613
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:24,160
 or like cutscenes or video or voice acting or any of the things that I think get away from the

614
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,800
 the pure core of actually playing the game. Okay, fair enough. So this will certainly be on

615
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,680
 like Hugo Ballot because look alternative reality, yeah 100% Hugo pick. That is that is quite a

616
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,880
 conceptual, um, argument by like it. Oh there's also a meta game about which I think is probably

617
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,560
 about the history of the development studio, so there's quite a lot of actual starts

618
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,320
 fiction in there, there's a lot of history gaming in there. Ah fair enough. Liz, do you have a pick?

619
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:02,400
 Yes, basically I haven't read anything particularly exciting since we last recorded, and so I'm

620
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,720
 falling back on my old standby of saying you should just read an Aiden Tricoste book because

621
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,200
 they're all pretty great. So I'm going to pick Alien Clay by Adrian Tricoski, this is his

622
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:23,680
 one of his 2024 science fiction novels, it is about a dissident scientist, um in a society where,

623
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,760
 you know, earth is run by the mandate and dissidents essentially get deported onto alien

624
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,560
 planets for use as work parties in a way that you know shows they don't really care if you live

625
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,320
 or die, it's just a way to kind of get you out of the way and use your wise labour.

626
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:44,720
 We follow a dissident art on Dagdev who gets dumped on the planet and it's kind of all about the

627
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,240
 politics inside the work camp, um both within like the prisoners there and the kind of

628
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,360
 soldiers and scientists who are there but aren't prisoners but they are kind of trapped on an

629
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,480
 alien planet and this alien planet is weird, I mean this is why you really age in Tricoski book,

630
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,000
 it's maybe not quite as weird as like children of time but it is still weird, it's all kind of

631
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,440
 weird symbiotic creatures where every thing you could point to and say that's an animal is kind of

632
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,840
 a symbiotic relationship between different ones and you know how does that even work for evolution

633
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,240
 for things like that and then at the end it kind of all comes together and kind of ties up this

634
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,640
 alien planet and evolution and revolutions and the politics of that in a fairly satisfying way.

635
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,920
 I don't think it is my favourite favourite age in Tricoski book, I haven't read his other 2024 one

636
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,800
 so it may not even be my favourite 2024 age in Tricoski book but I think it is worth a read.

637
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,760
 That is legit, I'm just looking to see whether I've read this one, I don't think I have, I will add

638
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,120
 it to the list. I like that he helpfully labels the books on his website as to whether they're

639
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:56,400
 science fiction or fantasy or both, um because I'm going to have to read his science fiction 2024

640
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,280
 novels on a counter how I am a judge for the Clark Award this year. Oh so I have to read all of the

641
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:11,920
 UK published 2024 novels and make judgements listeners judgements. I'll talk about that in

642
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,000
 future episodes probably as it goes through although there's limits on what I can and can't say

643
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,760
 but yes I am a judge and I don't get a little shield or a helmet but that's all right I do get a

644
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:32,960
 little badge. Oh oh I've got an art prompts. Yes yes yes yes yes but you know I'm looking forward

645
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,440
 to looking forward to reading a lot of the genre this year and um my fellow judges are

646
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,520
 our Nick Clark, Dolly Garland, Glenn Morgan and Jean Rowe this year so um yeah I'm really looking

647
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,960
 forward to it, it'd be good. That was the Oct Thought Podcast and it's goodbye from me.

648
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,720
 It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.

649
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,520
 I am going to want carved on my gravestone and well I mean obviously this is an immutable object.

650
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,160
 The point about the PDF is that it can then stand as a historical record so even if you decide that

651
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,240
 you always want everything that you're um releasing at the time to be in reflowable versions it is

652
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,040
 incredibly useful to have something that you could point to that you could basically put in a file

653
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,000
 and say five years later yes this is what was used. So I wanted to write a letter of comment to

654
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,480
 Oct Thought because when you read Chris's letter last episode you completely misconstrued what he

655
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,400
 was saying because he was making that argument and specifically saying that's true of paper and it's

656
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,440
 not true of any electronic file and so I agree with you it's important that there is a paper

657
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,040
 record of this and I think that is what Chris was saying last episode. Paper records yeah no I

658
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:12,160
 don't think I'd ask you as you know Bob I have yes a yes you can all sorts of examples of that

659
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,360
 but B no if they don't need to be paper they just need to be they just need to be files that are

660
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,960
 a pain to change and and that it's obvious if they've been changed. I think Chris's point is that as

661
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,560
 an information archivist he's seen digital files go AWOL enough that he thinks the only reliable way

662
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,040
 of doing it was paper and I did when I was editing it as I always should bring this up because this

663
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,200
 is an interesting thing and this is a massive digression for this part of the podcast but I think

664
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,160
 that was what Chris was getting at specifically. Indeed yes no he did and I did I did a lie that

665
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:48,320
 point and I shouldn't have done I'm sorry Chris I feel like that was true when I first got into

666
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:53,920
 computers the file formats were really janky in that sort of way I mean one of the things I lost

667
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,720
 was my wedding invitation and all of the files for my wedding invitation and all the stuff around

668
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:07,840
 that I do have the printed copies in this case but the since I think PDF and MP3 have been

669
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:17,280
 are old file formats that have been relatively stable and jpeg has been pretty good and png

670
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,360
 and they've been good for like a generate you know 25 30 years at this point which I think is

671
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:29,680
 probably enough that it will always be easy to read those files. Archivist do I encourage to write

672
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,160
 in and me angry at Alison? Archivist be angry. The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for
