1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,220
Who wants to talk about science fiction? Anyway, shall we talk about the Hugo Finalists?

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,740
We want to talk about science fiction, John.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:26,260
Hello everyone, welcome to episode 6 of the Octothorpe podcast,

4
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,320
a podcast about science fiction and SF fandom. I'm John Coxon.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,720
I'm Alison Scott.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,100
And I'm Liz Batty.

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:42,540
And we have a letter of comment from Espania Sheriff, my wife,

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,920
who attended a one-day convention called Wi-Fi Sci-Fi, which was hosted by Anne Collette,

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,540
and it was a mini-con consisting of a single Zoom panel in two parts,

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,580
followed by breakout room cavi-clatches. The panel had the topic SF and the pandemic,

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,680
tackled by five panelists, and then the second half of the panel was on the same topic,

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,300
but with different panelists. And then afterwards, you were assigned randomly to a breakout room with

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,240
one of the panelists. And in Espania's case, she talked to Corrie L. Lee, who was charming,

14
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,760
and then suddenly switched out to Adrian J. Walker, who was also lots of fun.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,500
This is the second Wi-Fi Sci-Fi event that has been run, and you can find more details at

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,840
annecollettes.co.uk slash Wi-Fi Sci-Fi. I did not go, but I heard Espania having a lot of fun.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,200
I believe I was playing board games on the internet while that was happening.

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,480
Is that because you are playing board games on the internet roughly 50% of the time you are awake, Tom?

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:43,800
No, that is a vicious lie. At least 25% of the time that I am awake, I am playing them in real life.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,860
So there you go.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,180
I think this is the second Wi-Fi Sci-Fi event, isn't it?

22
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,160
Yes. Clearly the first one went well if they've done a second one, and it seems like a kind of

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,140
nice way to spend three hours on a Saturday afternoon.

24
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,180
And it sounds like they've got the social aspects down a bit by just like randomly allocating you to

25
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,240
a room and you have a chat, which is, yeah.

26
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:14,640
Yeah, I am wondering whether this kind of mini convention will turn out to be a really viable

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:22,000
way of doing programming in the kind of current virtual age, because it means you can really

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,480
pick and choose what panels you want to go to. If like three people a weekend run a panel with

29
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,260
some socializing afterwards, you can massively split the amount of effort between a lot of

30
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,540
different people. You don't have to have a centralized effort, and you can pick and choose what events

31
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,480
you want to go to, which is potentially very cool.

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,860
I've done a lot of Zoom parties now, and I'm coming to the conclusion that for kind of just

33
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:55,660
having a good time, a number at around 30 to 40 is, well, maybe probably less than that, say invite 30

34
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,440
so that 25 or 20 turn up is really quite good, because that's enough for three different solid

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,940
conversations, which is all anyone's really going to get into anyway. And when you have more people,

36
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,900
you just up the level of complexity of keeping everyone organized, and it doesn't necessarily

37
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,660
do any better for people. So larger meetings aren't necessarily better. The advantage of great big

38
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:27,240
conventions or great big gatherings generally is that more of the people you want to see will be there,

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,040
but you can actually set up a virtual event with just the people you want to see on a particular topic.

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:44,320
I think for Zoom parties, it's also not quite the size of the room, but the people in the room. You need a certain amount of people in the room who are reasonably happy to sit there and chat on Zoom.

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:04:02,580
And you probably have some people who are sitting and chatting a little bit, but mostly sort of happy to listen. Like you need to replicate the dynamics of the conversation in the Zoom. If you have a quite full Zoom room, but no one kind of knows each other well, and they're not actually chatting, then that's not going to work either.

42
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:14,520
So the Wi-Fi sci-fi approach of having, all right, the author is in this room, and you can chat to the author, gives a sort of focus to them in a way that a general Zoom room party does not.

43
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,400
I have just realised that I have never personally had the experience of being in a Zoom room and having nobody in the room being willing to chat.

44
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
I didn't want to name names.

45
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,720
It may be that not everyone's experience is equivalent.

46
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:43,960
Because I have like, however much endless management training from years and years and years being tried to become a corporate clone and failing, I know I never find it difficult to start conversations in empty rooms.

47
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:53,660
It's also true that you will never be in the, you know, when you have Zoom parties and put people into breakout rooms, you are never in the room you are not in.

48
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,420
Yes.

49
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,700
If that makes sense.

50
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,400
Yes.

51
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Like, you never know what's going on in the other room.

52
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,920
So you probably assume that all rooms are kind of chatting away happily.

53
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,840
Whereas I have been in Zoom breakout rooms, which are a little bit quieter.

54
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,460
And you're sort of waiting for someone to get things going.

55
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:19,920
The problem, the problem with a Zoom party, I think, no, actually, the problem with a party is when you invite all of your friends and you're the only person that everyone knows.

56
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,160
And so that means that you get the clicks.

57
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,480
And if you've got like a couple of people who you're great mates with, but don't really know the rest of your friends at all, they're going to find it very difficult to interact.

58
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,860
And that's true at any party.

59
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:41,620
But I think it's also true in Zoom parties where if you've got a group of people, all of whom don't really know each other and only really know the host and the host is in a different breakout room, that will obviously be a problem.

60
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:57,160
OK, so my most recent Zoom party was credited as specifically a chance for European and Australian and New Zealand fans to get together at a time which was more or less convenient for both of them, but not convenient for Americans.

61
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,820
Because it had a structure, I think that helps somewhat with the thing.

62
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,060
And I kind of pretended that they were there to help me plan my guff trip, which they weren't.

63
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,820
They were just there to.

64
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:17,720
It was just to foster relations between European and Australian and New Zealand fans, which I think it did, though we didn't actually get any New Zealand fans except for Ming and Smitty, who don't count.

65
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,400
For those who don't know, Ming and Smitty both used to live in the UK before emigrating to New Zealand.

66
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:31,560
And so counting them as New Zealand fans is obviously fine, but may not be the New Zealand fans you're trying to reach out to in this particular case.

67
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:52,800
I will also say on the topic of Australian and New Zealand fandom, we were recommended by Claire Briley a podcast called the Two Chairs Talking Podcast, which is hosted by David Grigg and Perry Middlemiss, who are ex-chairs of previous Australian Worldcons.

68
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,360
And I gave that a listen in between last episode and this episode, and it's quite good.

69
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,240
They talk about books.

70
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,940
If you like Australian people talking about books, you may also enjoy it.

71
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,840
So give it a look.

72
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,580
Yes.

73
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:12,460
And they also, I think, record on a fortnightly schedule, as we do, and they have quite a lot, 27 episodes so far.

74
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,920
So they're a bit ahead of us.

75
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:24,280
On the topic of things that have happened in recent times, the Hugo finalists came out.

76
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,220
We touched on this in a previous episode, but we haven't really talked about it in any great detail.

77
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,660
So we're going to talk a little bit about that today.

78
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,100
And also, the BSFA awards were announced in a glittering ceremony on Zoom.

79
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:50,080
I think three hours late because they timed their awards ceremony to coincide with Zoom's first major outage since the start of lockdown, which is a tiny bit unfortunate, but I think they recovered quite well.

80
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,200
Oh, that's unfortunate.

81
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,020
Did you actually virtually attend?

82
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,560
I did not because of the whole middle of the night issue.

83
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,480
I did not.

84
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:19,180
I did not because of the whole not being a member of the BSFA issue, which I become, I'm feeling increasingly embarrassed about, actually, because one of the things I have been doing in lockdown is that they've been running author readings to compensate for not being able to do their regular pub meetings on a Wednesday in the middle of the month.

85
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,420
And I've gone to a couple of these and they've been jolly good.

86
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,600
So it turns out that author readings are one of the things I quite like in lockdown.

87
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,940
I like to be able to put on an author reading while I'm working with my hands.

88
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:42,100
Which is also good because when I was more involved in the BSFA, one of the things people would generally say is the London meetings are great, but I live outside London and can't get to them.

89
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:48,100
And so in lockdown, if they're now doing things broadcast by Zoom, again, they can have a slightly wider audience.

90
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,300
Yeah, I think I say Zoom there, but I think it's actually Facebook Live.

91
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,800
So now they will only get criticisms from people who are outside London and hate Facebook.

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,900
It's the BSFA Vector Reading Series.

93
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,300
And we should probably put a link in the show notes.

94
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,200
We shall do that.

95
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,660
So the BSFA Awards this year are great.

96
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,680
All of them, I think.

97
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,280
The winner of the best novel was Children of Ruin by Adrian Tchaikovsky.

98
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,960
Best short of fiction.

99
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,180
This is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Matar and Max Gladstone.

100
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,020
Best nonfiction was The Pleasant Professor of Robert A. Heinlein, Farah Mendelssohn.

101
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:34,740
And best artwork was the cover for Warism and Other Stories by Ian Waits, by Chris Baker, who's obviously better known as Fangorn.

102
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,580
Yeah, and they streamed it on Zoom, as we mentioned.

103
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,260
It seemed to go well.

104
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,100
I saw people talking about it on Twitter.

105
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,500
I must admit, I didn't watch because I am also not a member of the BSFA.

106
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,620
Although I am on the BSFA Discord.

107
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,360
So, you know, maybe I should join up.

108
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,540
And it does seem like they're doing some cool stuff at the moment.

109
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,680
I should probably be on the BSFA Discord, for that matter.

110
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,820
That sounds like good people doing good things on it.

111
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,880
I think they need to plug it slightly more because I think at the moment it is rather quiet.

112
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,520
I get the impression they're using it for their committee meetings.

113
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,700
So I think it is being used internally by the BSFA and is therefore at least somewhat active.

114
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,140
We shall put a link in the show notes.

115
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,520
Sorry, yes, I have read most of Tharra's book, which I found pretty interesting.

116
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,680
People keep thinking it's a biography, which it's not.

117
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,620
It's a close reading.

118
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:34,180
So it's probably of most interest to people who have read all of Heinlein's books, but quite a long time ago,

119
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:41,820
because I think actually Tharra coming to it with a fresh eye here in the 21st century is quite interesting.

120
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,680
I have read only This Is How You Lose a Time War,

121
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,300
which I definitely enjoyed.

122
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,060
But I think I enjoyed it, but it didn't kind of speak to me in my heart the way it has to a lot of people.

123
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,340
I know it is one of those books that comes along occasionally and a lot of people really, really love it.

124
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,160
And I merely liked it and really enjoyed it and admired it and think it's quite well done.

125
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:11,540
I will read This Is How You Lose the Time War because it is on the Hugo finalists this year.

126
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,960
So I will be reading it as part of my Hugo reading.

127
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,460
I will read Children of Ruin because I read the previous book in that series,

128
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:26,420
which I thoroughly enjoyed after a colleague in my research group recommended it,

129
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,760
which was called Children of Time.

130
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
And that was that was an amazing read.

131
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,360
So I do really want to read Children of Ruin, but I haven't got around to it yet.

132
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:43,040
But I have been reading the Hugo finalists.

133
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,340
I've made a start on chewing through some of those.

134
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:55,280
And I've also obviously kind of watched and read various bits of the Hugo finalists over the last year when they were actually coming out.

135
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,580
And so we're going to talk a little bit about what on the ballot that we have read, what we're planning to read,

136
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,900
what we enjoyed and what we didn't enjoy out of the stuff we know about.

137
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,080
And so the thing we're probably the most well up to date with is the best dramatic presentation categories,

138
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,080
which I think the three of us have watched most of.

139
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,120
So should we start with long form?

140
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,140
Yeah, I've seen everything on BDP long form apart from Star Wars, which I did mean to go and see.

141
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:34,580
But it came out at the point when I was about to go off on a long holiday back in the times when I was allowed to get on planes for a long period of time.

142
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,340
And the reviews came out and everyone said, oh, it's fine.

143
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,360
Oh, it's all right.

144
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,920
Oh, it's not that great, really.

145
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,800
And I thought, fine, I'll just go and see it later.

146
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,900
And then I never got around to it.

147
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,840
So I haven't seen it.

148
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,080
I understand it's fine to bad.

149
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,340
I really liked it.

150
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,920
It made me laugh and grin and clap and do all of those things.

151
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,480
I can entirely understand why people might not have liked it.

152
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,280
I think it is not a well-made movie, but it is a fun movie.

153
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,500
And I thoroughly enjoyed myself when I watched it.

154
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,560
I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed Endgame.

155
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,880
And that might be controversial.

156
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,940
Endgame's plot fundamentally made no sense to me.

157
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,240
And no one else seems to have this problem,

158
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,800
which is weird given the number of people that had a problem that Last Jedi had a hyperspace

159
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,380
jump in it.

160
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,340
But like, I don't know, the time travel in Endgame was just nonsense.

161
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,400
And I don't, I liked it.

162
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,880
It was fun.

163
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,780
It was a good ride.

164
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,300
Time travel is nonsense in all films apart from Looper, basically.

165
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,900
So I just...

166
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,960
Whoa, 12 monkeys?

167
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,860
Sorry, yes.

168
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,340
I did mean Prime and not Looper.

169
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,700
Time travel in the first Terminator movie holds up very well.

170
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,220
It's just that Terminator 2 went back and ruined it.

171
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,180
Shall I go back and do...

172
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,600
Sorry, so I could...

173
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,420
No, we're not going to let you undo your mistakes, Liz.

174
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,340
This is all going straight in.

175
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:54,620
I have the same reaction every time I see a J.J. Abrams film, which is that I leave the cinema

176
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,380
going, I thoroughly enjoyed that.

177
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,640
He did justice to the franchise that he is working in.

178
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:11,060
And then over the next few hours or days or weeks, the critical part of my brain goes,

179
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,740
well, did he really...

180
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:21,720
All he has done is parrot and ape bits of it without adding to or extending them in a way that is clever or interesting.

181
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:29,580
He just serves up fan service that is the cinematic equivalent of a shoe bun.

182
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:36,260
And I'm not saying I don't like shoe buns, but I feel that this was the culmination of a series

183
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,660
that I've been watching since I was 12 years old.

184
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,740
And we deserved a little bit more than that, especially given that the second episode had

185
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:52,660
done quite a lot to say we are taking this in a direction that isn't just giving adolescent

186
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,600
men in America what they want.

187
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,780
So I've got two reactions to that, which is firstly, I think that take on the two Abrams'

188
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,200
Star Wars movies fundamentally ignores one of their greatest strengths, which is I think the

189
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,320
characterisation in both of them is the best characterisation in any of the Star Wars movies.

190
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:16,220
I especially think that's clear in the first act of Rise of Skywalker, where the interaction between Rey and Poe and Finn

191
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:22,860
does an awful lot to tell you how much time has passed and how much they've gone through in between

192
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,360
Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker in a way that doesn't need to be written down because it's all there in the direction and the acting.

193
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,560
And I actually think Abrams is the best director that has ever directed a Star Wars movie, which may be controversial.

194
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,300
And I think Last Jedi was fantastic.

195
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,680
I do enjoy Last Jedi.

196
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:48,360
I do wish that they hadn't decided to fundamentally reanalyse what it is to be Star Wars in the eighth part of a nine part series,

197
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,220
because I think that made it very difficult to tell a coherent story.

198
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,260
I think if the eighth part of your series is suddenly like, but now what about something completely different?

199
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,580
There are problems there.

200
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:03,860
And I think the other half of what's wrong with Rise of Skywalker is that it is very difficult to work out how you get from the end of The Last Jedi

201
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:10,500
to the end of the nine part saga in a way that's anything approaching narratively satisfying.

202
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,860
I do think that Rise of Skywalker has some absolute bobbins in it.

203
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:20,220
And it reminds me a little bit of some of the Russell T. Davis work on Doctor Who, where you've got the bit at the end.

204
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,040
Spoilers for those who haven't seen Rise of Skywalker.

205
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,600
But there's a bit at the end.

206
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,460
Liz, do you mind if I spoil Rise of Skywalker?

207
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,080
No, go for it.

208
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,560
Go for it.

209
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,000
Go for it.

210
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,400
There's a bit at the end where the Emperor basically uses force lightning on an entire solar system.

211
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,480
And it's a bit like, did we need that?

212
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,000
No.

213
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,720
If we did need that, did we need a little bit of text that explained why that was OK?

214
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,400
Probably.

215
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,300
I didn't mind it.

216
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,200
It wasn't great.

217
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,540
But Abrams does this.

218
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:50,440
He does the infinitely ratcheting up the stakes, which does cheapen the stakes in the earlier movies, which is a shame.

219
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,460
But generally speaking, I thought it had flaws, but I did generally really enjoy it.

220
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:02,800
I still think the best of the three sequel movies is The Force Awakens, which I thought in many ways was almost perfect.

221
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,380
And I thoroughly enjoyed.

222
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,360
But that is my take.

223
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,160
Can we agree that you should not give the Hugo to it?

224
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,640
I would suggest at the end of this segment, we decide who we should give the Hugo to.

225
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,720
I have ideas.

226
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,440
Neither of them are Rise of Skywalker.

227
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,800
So I am not arguing that it should be the Hugo Victor.

228
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,540
Ha ha!

229
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,240
The Hugo Victor.

230
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,920
Victor Hugo.

231
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,740
It was a pun.

232
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:41,500
I have not seen the two episodes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe extruded product because it is getting very large and life is too short.

233
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:48,200
Actually, you only need to watch two movies and two television series a year or something and you're all right.

234
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,100
But that.

235
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,240
I genuinely enjoy the MCU.

236
00:17:51,240 --> 00:18:02,200
I enjoyed Captain Marvel, although in a way it was like, OK, this is maybe the 10th or 12th superhero origin story in the MCU I have seen.

237
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:11,380
And the exciting bit is now that they keep setting them in different random decades so they can have a different soundtrack and you can go, oh, it's got some 90s things in.

238
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,220
But I did.

239
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,480
I did still enjoy it.

240
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,220
I would probably go and watch another one.

241
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,660
I was thoroughly entertained for two and a half hours or whatever it is.

242
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,280
And it is nice to see a female lead.

243
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,960
Yes.

244
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,100
Brie Larson is someone I really like.

245
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,400
And so I liked her in it.

246
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:38,380
I will say, so I think I think Alison's point about it being the extruded Marvel Cinematic product, which is a very evocative metaphor, which I love.

247
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,720
I think it's true.

248
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:55,640
And I think it's difficult because I think one of the really shining things the MCU has done and whether or not you like the way it's done it, it's really interesting that they've taken a story and told it over a series of 20 movies with ancillary material.

249
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,180
Because I don't think that's really ever been done before.

250
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,640
And the closest you've probably got is James Bond, but that doesn't tell anything near a single story.

251
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:11,660
And so I think I think in some ways the MCU is actually really revolutionary in a way that people aren't really talking about.

252
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,660
But I think part of that is because it is really revolutionary telling a story where a lot of the beats are repeated.

253
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:25,840
And I can definitely see why there are people who are getting to the point where they're like, this is a bit I have gotten to the end of my patience with this.

254
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:35,260
Compared with most people I know, I have very low tolerance for the same story being told over and over with bigger bits over series.

255
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,140
From television series as well, I also struggle with this.

256
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,060
And we will get to why I think the two short television series are my favourite things of what I have so far seen.

257
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,660
I thought Good Omens was rather good.

258
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,660
I wasn't particularly expecting it.

259
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,760
I mean, I kind of knew it was in production.

260
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,320
I think that they did it in a way that did not overstay its welcome.

261
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:14,080
I think that the fact that Gaiman was on board probably helped sharpen the script to match modern sensibilities because Good Omens is 30 years old now.

262
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:21,900
And there are there is a lot of subtext in that novel that is not made anything like as clear as it was made in the series.

263
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:29,360
I thought a lot of ways that they used animation and time travel and all of that sort of thing were very clever and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

264
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,140
And of the ones I've seen on this list, which, as you know, is not very many, it's my second best.

265
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,360
I also enjoyed Good Omens.

266
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,480
I think I first read Good Omens when I was 10 or 11 years old and I loved it.

267
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,820
And it remains, you know, a book I have reread many times over the years and still really enjoy.

268
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:54,160
And while I like the TV adaptation, it is almost too faithful to the books.

269
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:03,080
It felt to me like there was too much trying to keep a lot of the actual wording of the books in by having some pretty unnecessary narration.

270
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,900
Narration from God.

271
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,300
And some of the bits they kept in, I think you could have cut entirely.

272
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:18,980
And also, I think some of the bits with, yes, I think some of the stuff with Sergeant Shadwell and Madam Tracy has not aged particularly well.

273
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:26,540
And it's really noticeable in the show, minor spoiler, the bit where Aziraphale sort of takes over Madam Tracy's body.

274
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:32,900
Works much, much better in the books because in the TV show, it just puts Michael Sheen out of action for an episode.

275
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:42,280
So I would really have liked to actually, if they trimmed it more, maybe trimmed out some of the bikers of the apocalypse, trimmed out these bits that I think don't work as well on screen.

276
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,160
And it was almost too faithful.

277
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,300
But it was way, way better than what I feared we might get.

278
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,420
So I can't complain too much.

279
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,720
So I will say, I think I agree with you.

280
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,880
I think it was too faithful.

281
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,060
I think they should have taken more liberties with it.

282
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,480
And I am also in the same boat that I think I read Good Omens when I was 10 or 11.

283
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,940
And it remains a very, very fond memory.

284
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,880
It was the book that introduced me to both Pratchett and Gaiman's writing.

285
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,620
So it will always have a place in my heart.

286
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:17,140
I think I agree with you that they needed to do more to make it into a TV show rather than into a TV version of a book.

287
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:23,400
I will say that I thought the chemistry between most of the characters was amazing.

288
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
And I thought the actors did a tremendous job.

289
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,600
I am happy that Michael Sheen and David Tennant are getting a lockdown TV show together.

290
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,520
As far as I can tell off the back of the fact that they were good together in Good Omens, which is Chef's Kiss.

291
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,980
I thought Jack Whitehall was very good, which surprised me because I was expecting not to think he was very good.

292
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,940
The thing you said about the Bikers of the Apocalypse is really interesting because my main problem with that is that they cut out all of the funny bits and left in all of the other bits.

293
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:58,340
And I think they really needed to decide whether they were going to keep the hilarious other four bikers, which made it work, or whether they were going to really slim down that whole thing.

294
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,980
But they sort of went for a middle road where they took the funny bit out.

295
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,580
And that I'm not sure.

296
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,140
And I do wonder whether that's because it was Neil Gaiman that was overseeing the adaptation and not Terry Pratchett.

297
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:17,760
Because I wonder whether some of the more out there funny bits of Good Omens were more on Pratchett's side than Gaiman's, shall we say.

298
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,560
But generally speaking, I thought it was very good.

299
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm not sure it's my favourite of the roster, but I really liked it.

300
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,800
Gaiman is very good at whimsy, but he is not a humorist in the way that Pratchett was.

301
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,100
And very little of Gaiman's solo output is laugh out loud hilarious.

302
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,260
So I think you can reasonably assume that everything properly funny in Good Omens comes from Pratchett.

303
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:49,460
Everything that's properly funny and I think properly sort of sharp humor as well seems to me to be more of a Pratchett thing than a Gaiman thing.

304
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,660
I mean, obviously, this is all speculation and we may be entirely wrong, but it seems reasonable from what we know about the two authors.

305
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,500
With a bit of luck, we'll get a lock from Neil Gaiman telling us how we're going.

306
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,800
Yes, Neil, please write in and tell us how we've gotten all this wrong.

307
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,900
We would love to hear from you.

308
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:12,700
I really like Russian Doll.

309
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,140
I like lots of things it did.

310
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:23,880
And I like the fact that just I think I hadn't noticed when it came out that Netflix was in the habit of just sticking up some stuff that was quite out there.

311
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:34,540
And I like that Russian Doll is I don't think it's like hugely original, but I like the fact it was clearly quite cheap to make.

312
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:41,960
And so therefore it doesn't have when you read novels and they're great and interesting and weird.

313
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:55,900
You think, well, if this had been made into a film or a television series, people would have shaved bits off the edges to make them fit more tightly into a mold of what they think extruded cinematic product should be like.

314
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,780
And Russian Doll absolutely doesn't do that.

315
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,640
It's got a load of characters and they're quite wild and they do a load of things.

316
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:13,400
You know, a harrowing is actually spectacularly not particularly nice in a way that is not that common, even in the more elaborately varied television that we get now.

317
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,200
And it's short.

318
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,920
So they made quite a short amount of it and it tells a whole story and then it's done.

319
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,580
And I don't know if they're planning to do any more.

320
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,460
Obviously, when things are a big success on Netflix, they tend to do a second series.

321
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,540
That's a little bit of a shame.

322
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:38,400
But it feels like it told a whole story and it was done and it had lots of proper science fictional content, which even now, even with all the science fiction around us all the time, we don't get as much of that as we maybe should.

323
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,200
And I thought it was funny and entertaining.

324
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,500
And that's what I want from my long form dramatic presentation.

325
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,480
Thank you very much.

326
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,240
And don't necessarily get it, though.

327
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,400
It's kind of eight short form dramatic presentations.

328
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,320
So it once again demonstrated that the Hugo categories are very complicated.

329
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:10,380
I think I would say that it feels like something which fits much better in long form than many series which have been nominated in long form, because I think it does tell one complete story over eight episodes.

330
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,180
And that's one reason why it's so satisfying to watch.

331
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,500
Without spoiling it, it is not a concept that is entirely new.

332
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:29,940
I did think that it is quite innovative in that it is a very dark comedy in a way that you don't often see US kind of situation comedies do.

333
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:36,480
And the bleakness of it and the humour of it was really refreshing.

334
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,740
I really liked that.

335
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,600
I think it's relatively unusual for comedy to be taken seriously.

336
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,800
It's relatively unusual for genre to be taken seriously.

337
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,020
So the fact that this was a genre comedy that was taken seriously was really pleasing.

338
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:56,780
And I think stands in opposition to The Good Place, which is another genre comedy that was taken seriously, but has a very different feel in terms of its optimism to Russian Doll.

339
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,680
And so I'm really happy that Russian Doll is on the roster.

340
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,780
And I think it's one of the two that I would be the happiest to see win.

341
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,920
And what is the other one, John?

342
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,840
The other one I would be happy to see win is US, directed by Jordan Peele.

343
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,440
I have not seen US, but I do want to.

344
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,480
And I suspect it's quite good just because everything Jordan Peele has ever done is good.

345
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:26,060
So we will not be spoiling so that Alison does not have to put her fingers in her ears and shout la la la, because I do not want to have to edit around that.

346
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:31,200
So, Liz, can you spoiler free discuss what you liked about US?

347
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:42,920
I think what might be funnier is if I did it with spoilers and elaborate hand gestures and Alison had to put it on mute and just watch me, you know, mime the entire film.

348
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,500
But that would probably not be much fun for the listeners.

349
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:51,480
I will not be doing that.

350
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,160
Alison, you can put them back in.

351
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,040
I feel that would be too boring for the listeners.

352
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,200
I think the best part about us was when the Hoff turned up.

353
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,500
No.

354
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,820
I liked it.

355
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:14,800
I don't watch a lot of horror films, but I did find this one to be scary, but in a really sort of plot and character driven way, if that makes sense.

356
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,560
Like it felt like a slasher film, but with something really deep going on under it.

357
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,960
I think that acting is fantastic.

358
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:30,080
I don't think it's really spoiling anything because it's in the trailer to say that there are lots of doppelgangers involved.

359
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,800
And I think all the acting of the people with their doppelgangers is amazing.

360
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,900
You can always tell who is who, even if they're not speaking.

361
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,320
The acting in it is phenomenal and the direction is phenomenal.

362
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:49,300
But I also think it is creepy in a way that I find most horror movies are not.

363
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:58,300
But I think both Us and Get Out are incredibly creepy movies that made me feel really uncomfortable in a really nice way.

364
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,320
That's going to sound weird, but like I enjoyed the feeling of uncomfort I had while I was watching them.

365
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,660
They really got under my skin and I really enjoyed them.

366
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,680
I think Us is really, really great.

367
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:17,440
And I think you can see that Jordan Peele's background in comedy is helping a lot with his ability to do the timing.

368
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,480
I think his sense of comic timing is helping him a lot with the pacing and the way he can make you feel uncomfortable through the film.

369
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,920
I really liked it.

370
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,460
I would be very happy to see it win.

371
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,240
I would highly recommend watching it.

372
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,520
Me and Espania bought Us and Get Out on iTunes for 15 quid because they've got a bundle at the moment.

373
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,960
We thoroughly enjoyed watching Us the other week.

374
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:46,580
So what do you feel should win based on the ones you've seen anyway?

375
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,860
Of the ones I've seen, I'd be voting for Russian Doll.

376
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:56,500
For all the reasons about things not overstaying their welcome and telling a story in the right amount of space that I've seen.

377
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,960
But I mean, I'm sure that Us is well up there as well.

378
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,620
And I also like Good Omens.

379
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,360
Do you want to rank them in order, Alison?

380
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,580
Like, as you would on your ballot?

381
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,960
Of the ones I've seen, I've only seen three of these, haven't I?

382
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,220
She has ranked the three she's seen, I think.

383
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,860
Which are Russian Doll, Good Omens.

384
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,040
Rise of Skywalker.

385
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,260
Sorry, I should say more clearly.

386
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,620
Russian Doll, Good Omens.

387
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,020
Noah Ward, Rise of Skywalker.

388
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,140
Fair, fair.

389
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,760
What will you be ranking them, Liz?

390
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,100
You've put me on the spot now because I hadn't thought about my lower ranked choice voting.

391
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,980
I think number one is Us.

392
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,500
Probably Russian Doll.

393
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,680
I'm going to have to think about it some more.

394
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,140
There's things I love about Good Omens and Captain Marvel and Avengers Endgame.

395
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,300
But I really need to think about it some more.

396
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,880
And how much of it is, am I judging Avengers Endgame as a film?

397
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,780
Or am I judging Avengers Endgame of the 20th in a series of 20 films?

398
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,840
I think this is actually a really interesting question.

399
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:08,340
Because I kind of wish that the Marvel Cinematic Universe had been nominated as a single dramatic presentation long for.

400
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,040
Like the whole thing from Iron Man to Endgame.

401
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,300
Because if that happened, I would have ranked it one.

402
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,660
But as it is, I'm going to put Russian Doll.

403
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,920
Then I'm going to put Us.

404
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,760
Then I'm going to put Good Omens.

405
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,040
Then I'm going to put Captain Marvel.

406
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,480
Then I'm going to put Rise of Skywalker.

407
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,780
And then I'm going to put Endgame.

408
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,920
Because I fundamentally didn't feel like Endgame did a good job of wrapping up the MCU.

409
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,060
I think a lot of people liked it because it had a lot of fan service in it.

410
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,860
But I just didn't think it held together as a movie very well at all.

411
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,200
But I did enjoy seeing it in the cinema.

412
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,680
And there are some really good bits.

413
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,240
I enjoyed all of them is the problem.

414
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,020
I wouldn't put any of them below no award.

415
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:49,020
We may get on to discussions of when you would put something below no award.

416
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,380
But this is not the category where I would.

417
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,720
Yes, okay.

418
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,980
I'm probably being a bit harsh.

419
00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:01,240
I just would be so sad if we got to Virtual Con Zealand and they gave the Hugo to Rise of Skywalker.

420
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,320
And I do think it's a very significant risk because I think there are a lot of people at the World Con

421
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,920
who've been watching Star Wars movies for 40 years and would like to see an award for that.

422
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:19,920
I think that's a good point because I think if Star Wars and Endgame are going to get ranked on the entirety of the sagas they belong to instead of as individual works,

423
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,380
it becomes much harder to predict what the fandom is going to give the Hugo to.

424
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,180
So I think if people don't do that, it will go to either Russian Doll or us.

425
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,980
I think if they do do that, then Endgame's got a really good chance of winning, is my thought.

426
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,660
Although Good Omens has a lot of fans, so maybe I'm wrong.

427
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,900
Maybe Good Omens could steal it.

428
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,500
I wouldn't want to bet money.

429
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,720
Oh, Good Omens really does have a lot of fans.

430
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,820
It really does.

431
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,600
Okay, so we were going to discuss best dramatic presentation short form, but it turns out we had a lot of thoughts.

432
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,940
And so we're going to leave that for a future episode.

433
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:59,700
Do we want to touch on staying sane in the apocalypse?

434
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:07,060
My method of staying sane in the apocalypse is having discussions with you two about the minutiae of Disney-based marketing schedules.

435
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,600
How are you both coping with COVID-19?

436
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:17,780
I do find that making sure that I'm having chats with my friends, and not only that,

437
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,520
that I'm making sure that those chats go in different directions,

438
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,900
so that I'm talking to different friends about different things on different occasions,

439
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,840
is really important for me.

440
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,760
And that I do set up Zoom chats where unexpected people are talking to each other,

441
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,540
because I think you get...

442
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,360
If you're always talking to the same people,

443
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,400
even if you frame it around a board game,

444
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,260
or a quiz night,

445
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:38,820
or whatever,

446
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,400
you inevitably get to the point where somebody goes,

447
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,860
have you been anywhere nice recently?

448
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,100
And the other person goes,

449
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,940
well, I went for a nice walk in Bluebell Woods at Castle Barnard.

450
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,220
And then you realise that there's only so much you can say about walking in Bluebell Woods.

451
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,240
It's not true.

452
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,700
But you actually run out very quickly of things to talk about,

453
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,000
even though we've all been watching things and doing things.

454
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,340
Whereas if you actually get some different people together,

455
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,520
you can actually start to have the meaty conversations about,

456
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,420
you know, everything else in the world.

457
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:16,040
Because people from different countries and people in different situations do have different experiences,

458
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,820
and they're good.

459
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,400
I think I've been doing much the same.

460
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,720
Have you been talking to a plethora of people, Liz?

461
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,260
I mean, I have, but that's because I also went out and had socially distanced outdoor coffee with some people yesterday,

462
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,860
because we are on a much freer schedule, I think, than you guys are at this point.

463
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,520
Caroline came round and had a coffee at my house,

464
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,620
and I did not think we had broken any rules, but it turns out that we did.

465
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,900
She came to my house and put six Georgettea novels on my doorstep,

466
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,240
whilst in the process of doing other errands which are legal.

467
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,900
And then she went and sat in my front garden, some distance away from the house.

468
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,920
And I came out with a polypin of beer, which I was selling her,

469
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,860
and put it on my recycling bin.

470
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,160
And then we had a cup of coffee together at about three metres apart,

471
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,120
which I thought was completely legal and fine now.

472
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,100
But it turns out we needed to actually walk into the street,

473
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,700
because you could only do it at this in an outdoor public place.

474
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,680
So if we'd had done exactly the same thing,

475
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,860
but I'd started off by putting two chairs in the middle of the road,

476
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,180
we'd have been good.

477
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,040
Fair enough.

478
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,700
But as it was, it was legal.

479
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,720
It was great fun, though.

480
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,780
I've got to the stage where every time you see another human being,

481
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,160
you're like, oh, this is amazing.

482
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,400
It's a person.

483
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,280
We can drink coffee.

484
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,620
We can have a conversation.

485
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Yeah, we have in our garden, we have a fence which is short enough

486
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,580
that if we sit in the middle of our garden

487
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,240
and our neighbours sit in the middle of their garden,

488
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,820
we can shout at each other while having lunch.

489
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,820
And that is quite good for conversation.

490
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,240
It does need you to shout.

491
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,380
You can't talk normally.

492
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,220
But it works quite well, actually.

493
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,040
We're probably about three or four metres apart, I would say.

494
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,460
But yeah, it's not bad.

495
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,280
And then I've also been having Spanish lessons from my sister-in-law,

496
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,040
which has been fun.

497
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,360
It keeps you occupied.

498
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,300
And I really, really hate talking in Spanish.

499
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,680
Not because I don't like Spanish,

500
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,280
but because, as listeners will have noted,

501
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,420
I talk quite a lot.

502
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,360
And talking and being unable to say the thing you want to say

503
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,920
is a very frustrating thing.

504
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,480
I think if you talk a lot, I'm finding it really difficult.

505
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,980
But I am persevering.

506
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,680
And it is quite good so far.

507
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,300
This is why extroverts struggle with language learning.

508
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,600
Because, you know, you have all these things to say

509
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,000
and it's incredibly hard to say them.

510
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,740
And then you do language learning.

511
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,600
And I've got to the stage where I can read quite a lot of Japanese now,

512
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,680
but cannot say anything in Japanese.

513
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,340
And that's it.

514
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,660
And that's really embarrassing.

515
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,100
You're learning Thai, Liz.

516
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,080
I am.

517
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,840
Yes, I'm having online language lessons.

518
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,620
And one of the problems is that

519
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,400
it can sometimes be quite hard to hear.

520
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,460
And one of the key things that we are

521
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,200
supposed to be learning right now

522
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,340
is how to read the different tones

523
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,140
from the different combinations of consonants and vowels.

524
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,760
And so what it actually leads to

525
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,040
is me saying something

526
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,520
and then doing a hand motion

527
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,900
to prove that I do know

528
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,360
what tone it's supposed to be in,

529
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,540
even if it's not possible to hear over Zoom

530
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,060
exactly what tone I'm using.

531
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,960
So there's a lot of like hands going up

532
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,820
and hands going down

533
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,640
and hands representing rising and falling tones.

534
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,500
It's quite funny.

535
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,300
Excellent.

536
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,900
And we can have a octothor

537
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,080
where I speak in Spanish,

538
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Liz speaks in Thai

539
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,000
and Alison is the only one anyone can understand.

540
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,620
And that will be fun.

541
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,400
Absolutely.

542
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,780
Because you do need my hand gestures

543
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,640
to tell what tone I'm supposed to be attempting.

544
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,860
I can embed pictures of you doing them

545
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
in the podcast art.

546
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,080
So I don't know whether listeners have picked up on this,

547
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,740
but I put pictures in the podcast.

548
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,140
So if you're looking at your podcast player

549
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,020
when a certain part of the podcast plays,

550
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,700
the picture will change sometimes,

551
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,500
you know, if there's a relevant picture to the discussion.

552
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,520
And I could do second long chapters

553
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,340
with Liz gesturing to indicate where her tone should be.

554
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,540
And that would be a delightfully hacky way

555
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,220
of solving the problem, I think.

556
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,300
Thank you everyone for listening to the sixth episode

557
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,360
of the Octothorpe podcast.

558
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,660
We will see you in a four nights time.

559
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,440
But for now, I have been John Coxon

560
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,820
and it's goodbye from me.

561
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,600
And I have been Alison Scott

562
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,780
and it's goodbye from me.

563
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,060
And I have been and still am Liz Batty

564
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,160
and it's goodbye from me.

565
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,220
Yay!

566
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,540
Yay!

567
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,800
Yay, that's six episodes.

568
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,680
That's amazing.

569
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,160
Are we eligible for Hugo yet?

570
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,360
The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space

571
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,100

573
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:55,440
Okay.

574
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,660
So I think one of the really interesting things

575
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,700
about the MCU is that they're doing this kind of

576
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,240
two or three movie a year product

577
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,640
where they're doing movies which are

578
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,700
in some ways very similar to each other.

579
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,300
And then occasionally there's a movie

580
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,180
which is quite different.

581
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,820
Like for instance,

582
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,760
the first Guardians of the Galaxy felt quite different

583
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,180
or the Ant-Man films feel quite different.

584
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,060
But then other films feel quite similar.

585
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,060
And one of the really interesting things

586
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,460
is that they did try that with Star Wars.

587
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,360
They released Solo,

588
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,960
which was an attempt to do a heist movie

589
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,660
that felt different from the saga.

590
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,540
And it was relatively poorly received

591
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,680
by the fandom and financially.

592
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,080
And I think they have almost decided

593
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,800
to retreat from doing a lot of movies

594
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,060
into the realm of TV.

595
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,160
So they've announced

596
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,120
they're doing the Obi-Wan Kenobi TV series.

597
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,220
They're doing the Mandalorian.

598
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,540
They've brought the Clone Wars back.

599
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,700
I'm sure they've announced something else

600
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,360
that I'm forgetting.

601
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,480
But a lot of what they're doing in Star Wars

602
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,860
seems to be more on the television

603
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,660
slash book slash comic side.

604
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,800
And they seem to be really hesitant

605
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,680
to try and make a Star Wars cinematic universe.

606
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,240
And I think it's really interesting

607
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,420
the way that Marvel has been able

608
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,540
to tell this multi-movie story.

609
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,700
But when Star Wars tried something similar,

610
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,120
I think it was quite poorly received.

611
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,960
And I am wondering how that's going to impact

612
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,180
Lucasfilm and Marvel's decisions

613
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,920
going forward from here.

614
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,340
Because for whatever reason,

615
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,920
I think they're in quite different situations

616
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,240
with regards to their fan bases.

617
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,940
And I'm not entirely sure why.

618
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,160
Well, I think part of that is that

619
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,340
basically the film landscape

620
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,620
is just too crowded for Disney right now

621
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,740
because they have Marvel films.

622
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,300
They have Star Wars films.

623
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,620
They have Pixar.

624
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,420
They have Disney animation.

625
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,500
They have their live action remakes

626
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,280
of Disney animation.

627
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,900
And they're in a position

628
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,940
where if they're not careful,

629
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,340
they will start cannibalizing

630
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,940
their own audience.

631
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,100
But in a way,

632
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,640
I think it's also just that

633
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,560
Solo was highly anticipated

634
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,100
and not that great.

635
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,460
I think I would also cite Rogue One here,

636
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,480
which is also a chance to tell

637
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,620
a different sort of story

638
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,880
in the Star Wars cinematic universe.

639
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,420
And I think which worked

640
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,860
completely on its own terms

641
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,620
and was great.

642
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,460
So, you know,

643
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,340
I think there is still,

644
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,560
there is more they can do here.

645
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,640
I think,

646
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,620
I think I will push back a little bit

647
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,100
on Solo being hotly anticipated.

648
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,120
I, I, I, I'm quite,

649
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,580
it may surprise you to learn

650
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,800
I follow quite a few people

651
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,600
who are fans of Star Wars

652
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,280
on the Twitters.

653
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,160
But I didn't see a lot of excitement

654
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,740
for Solo.

655
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,340
And a lot of people I follow

656
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,320
were very skeptical

657
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,620
that it was a story

658
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,660
that needed to be told.

659
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,820
And I think part of the problem

660
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,380
with Solo is that it was a prequel.

661
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,020
And I think Star Wars fans

662
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,200
are very skeptical of prequels.

663
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,000
I can't think why.

664
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,860
But, and I think one of the really

665
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,020
interesting things as well

666
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,660
was that because it came out

667
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,600
five months after The Last Jedi,

668
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,580
The Last Jedi had only been out

669
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,300
of cinemas for about six weeks

670
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,620
when Solo was in cinemas.

671
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,960
I just wonder whether

672
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,880
they should have pushed it back

673
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,860
to the, because,

674
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,740
because they had been trying

675
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,940
to release all of these movies

676
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,280
at summer and they had all

677
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,220
been pushed back to Christmas.

678
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,960
And Solo was the first one

679
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,360
of the new Disney era

680
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,840
where they managed to release it

681
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,520
on time.

682
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,820
But I actually think releasing

683
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,120
it on time was a huge mistake

684
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,000
because it meant you didn't

685
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,200
have enough time to build up

686
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,020
that anticipation

687
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,680
in between The Last Jedi

688
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,360
and Solo.

689
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,300
It felt like The Last Jedi

690
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,580
had only just come out really.

691
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,940
And so I think,

692
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,500
I think there were a large number

693
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,760
of missteps made.

694
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,400
And I, but, and I agree

695
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,380
that I think,

696
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,320
and I don't know

697
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,940
whether I'm right.

698
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,960
I think the reaction to Solo

699
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,040
was much more because

700
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,720
of the lack of marketing

701
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,540
and the lack of thought

702
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,620
about when to release it

703
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,740
than it was about the quality

704
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,300
of the movie.

705
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,120
Because I think quality

706
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,880
is almost irrelevant

707
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,040
when it comes to blockbusters.

708
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,420
And that's not just Star Wars.

709
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,240
It's like, there's a very

710
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,780
pessimistic view of all movies.

711
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,740
Yeah, they had a very serious

712
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,400
not Harrison Ford problem too.

713
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,440
I watched the Star Wars movies

714
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,200
when I was very young

715
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,180
in like the 90s

716
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,160
and I am not as attached

717
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,800
to Harrison Ford

718
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,220
as my parents are

719
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,580
who were very appalled

720
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,280
that Harrison Ford

721
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,900
was not in it.

722
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,300
But I do wonder

723
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,460
whether that's the other part.

724
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,200
It's like a film

725
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,540
that's designed to appeal

726
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,620
to original trilogy fans,

727
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,560
but it's a film that

728
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,540
treads on the old trilogy's

729
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,600
toes in some ways.

730
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,340
Liz, did you have any?

731
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,460
I did have several things.

732
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,200
Can I say the several things

733
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,660
I was going to say?

734
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,600
Yes, say the several things.

735
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,420
So one thing I would push back

736
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,220
on that is Marvel released

737
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,860
Captain Marvel and Avengers

738
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,700
Endgame two months apart.

739
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,140
So I don't think there's a reason

740
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,520
you can't release these things

741
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,560
in quick succession

742
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,260
if you think the audience,

743
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
you know, obviously there is

744
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:36,860
an audience there

745
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,520
for some of them.

746
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,380
I mean, Avengers Endgame

747
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,960
is kind of a special case,

748
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,540
but it didn't seem to hurt

749
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,140
Captain Marvel.

750
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,200
People were not staying away

751
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,020
thinking, oh, I'll go

752
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,760
and see the next one

753
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,940
or I've just seen one.

754
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,820
And my main issue with Solo

755
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,100
is I don't think

756
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,260
Alden Ehrenreich does

757
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,460
a particularly great job

758
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,460
and I just found it to be

759
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,220
not that entertaining,

760
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,000
to be honest.

761
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,060
So just to push back on that,

762
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,980
Solo has a higher

763
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,060
Tomatometer score

764
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,900
than Rise of Skywalker

765
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,360
and a higher audience score

766
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:03,960
than Last Jedi.

767
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,400
So if we're going to say

768
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,060
it's about the quality

769
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,680
of the movies,

770
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,600
I would have thought

771
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,560
either Rise of Skywalker

772
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,520
or Last Jedi

773
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,640
should have been much worse

774
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,820
in terms of box office

775
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,220
than Solo.

776
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,020
and I appreciate

777
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,820
that the Marvel movies

778
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,860
have been much closer together

779
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,820
and I don't know why

780
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,840
I think the Marvel movies

781
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,940
don't have this problem,

782
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,660
but I definitely feel like

783
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,640
there was a large reaction

784
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,360
in the Star Wars fandom

785
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:28,940
which was

786
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,480
we don't need this movie

787
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,060
and a large lack

788
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,840
of anticipation

789
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,200
in a way that there isn't

790
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,560
for Marvel.

791
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,320
And so I agree

792
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,280
on the face of it,

793
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,280
I think it seems like

794
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:37,820
you should be able

795
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,320
to release Solo

796
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,300
five months after

797
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:39,640
Last Jedi.

798
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,360
It should be fine.

799
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,360
But I am just

800
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,560
deeply unconvinced

801
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,240
that I think it was

802
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:44,740
anything to do

803
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,400
with the quality of the movie.

804
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,460
Because like I say,

805
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,620
in some ways Solo

806
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,480
was better received

807
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,060
than Episode 8

808
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,660
and Episode 9

809
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,840
and it did far worse

810
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,480
than the box office.

811
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,620
Like far worse.

812
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,920
I miss what you were saying

813
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,620
about Last Jedi.

814
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,240
Were you saying about

815
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,200
what were you

816
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,140
rating Last Jedi by?

817
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,440
So if you look at

818
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,000
the Last Jedi

819
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,860
audience reviews,

820
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,340
Last Jedi got 90%

821
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,180
from critics

822
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,840
and got like 40%

823
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,760
from the audience.

824
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,400
Rise of Skywalker

825
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,740
got about 40%

826
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,260
from critics

827
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,300
and about 90%

828
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,280
from the audience

829
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,020
if I recall correctly

830
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:19,640
or it might have been

831
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,200
lower on the audience side.

832
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,180
And then Solo

833
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,200
got about 70%

834
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:23,740
on both.

835
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,820
And so if Solo

836
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,540
is worse

837
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,100
and that's why

838
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,900
it did worse,

839
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,260
then either Last Jedi

840
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,040
or Rise of Skywalker

841
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,500
should have done

842
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,160
even worse.

843
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,680
And the fact they didn't

844
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,400
I think is difficult

845
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,020
to explain.

846
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,340
I think there is

847
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,300
a quality-based explanation

848
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,580
which is that Marvel

849
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,440
at this point

850
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,620
is an extremely solid,

851
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,600
reliable brand

852
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,840
and they very rarely

853
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,240
drop films

854
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,420
people feel are duds.

855
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,740
So people are now

856
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,220
reassured that if they

857
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,500
go and see a Marvel film

858
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,580
it will probably meet

859
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,120
at least a particular

860
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,860
high-water mark

861
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,980
and probably go higher.

862
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,060
I don't think people

863
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,840
are convinced of that

864
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,260
for Star Wars films yet.

865
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,560
And I think there's also

866
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,240
the obvious problem

867
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,020
with looking at

868
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,880
The Last Jedi's

869
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,340
audience rankings

870
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,380
and that we know

871
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,020
The Last Jedi

872
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,560
is really not liked

873
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,340
in a particular

874
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,380
subset of fandom

875
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:06,860
who are probably

876
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,740
more likely to have

877
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,180
gone and written

878
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:08,840
reviews of it.

879
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,620
We may be going

880
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,440
too far into

881
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Star Wars versus

882
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:12,860
Marvel.

883
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,080
I have one tiny

884
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,420
more thing to say

885
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,540
about Marvel

886
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,220
which is that

887
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,760
one of the reasons

888
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,140
I think that

889
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,920
Marvel,

890
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,720
the whole Marvel

891
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,900
cinematic universe

892
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,580
with all its

893
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,280
entrails and tendrils

894
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,760
is accepted

895
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,140
and even loved

896
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,680
for that

897
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,260
by its audience

898
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:34,920
is that it's

899
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,680
actually coming

900
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,360
from a source

901
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:37,920
which is its

902
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,780
comics which

903
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,420
because Stan Lee

904
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:40,940
invented

905
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,660
the system

906
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,420
of getting people

907
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,100
to buy more

908
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:44,680
product

909
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,120
in comics

910
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,400
by having

911
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,040
all of these

912
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,600
crossovers

913
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,320
this is what

914
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,820
this is

915
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,460
it's always

916
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,020
been doing

917
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:51,420
this.

918
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,260
it's the

919
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:52,620
thing that

920
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,060
is unique

921
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,800
about Marvel

922
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,600
and so

923
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,020
to some extent

924
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:56,600
they have just

925
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,320
encapsulated the

926
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,180
Marvel unique

927
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,880
selling point

928
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,420
which is they

929
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,040
don't just sell

930
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,380
you stuff

931
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:01,840
they sell you

932
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,580
a very large

933
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,040
amount of

934
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:03,520
stuff and

935
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,280
you like it.

936
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,300
That's actually

937
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,260
a really good

938
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:06,500
point.

939
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:06,980
I think

940
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,720
the fact that

941
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,200
Marvel has

942
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:10,720
source material

943
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,240
that is tried

944
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:11,680
and tested

945
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,260
may also

946
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,060
massively help

947
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,580
and I

948
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,360
it's very

949
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,240
but I think

950
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,180
I didn't

951
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,760
sorry I didn't

952
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,300
intend to

953
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:18,900
derail this

954
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,200
into the

955
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,480
discussion

956
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,980
it's become

957
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,640
but I just

958
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,380
I'm not

959
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,400
I'm not

960
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,960
sure I'm

961
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,840
right but

962
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,240
I'm not

963
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,660
sure it's

964
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,600
obvious why

965
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,240
Star Wars

966
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,000
can't sustain

967
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,740
the same level

968
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,180
of movie

969
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:30,780
releases as

970
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,500
Marvel and

971
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,060
it could just

972
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:32,620
be that Solo

973
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,520
was empirically

974
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,480
bad but I

975
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,420
am sceptical

976
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:35,860
that that's the

977
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,720
whole story but

978
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,240
I don't know

979
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,760
and so that was

980
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,360
all I was trying

981
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:39,600
to

982
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,560
welcome to

983
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,720
Octothorpe

984
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,360
where this

985
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,140
week in the

986
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:44,780
absence of

987
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,580
new news

988
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,320
from science

989
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:46,780
fiction and

990
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,780
fandom we are

991
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,420
having a two

992
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,660
hour animated

993
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,620
discussion on

994
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,620
Star Wars

995
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,540
versus Marvel

996
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,760
it's definitely

997
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,820
on topic guys

998
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,100
I think you're

999
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,000
correct I don't

1000
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,700
think it that

1001
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,580
Solo is it's

1002
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,220
not a bad

1003
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:01,860
film I just

1004
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,940
didn't enjoy it

1005
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,460
that much but

1006
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,040
I think had

1007
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,220
Solo turned out

1008
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,180
to be a

1009
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:06,780
really really

1010
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,960
good film like

1011
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,680
a Guardians of

1012
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,140
the Galaxy

1013
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,840
level of quality

1014
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,620
or something like

1015
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,360
that then people

1016
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:12,700
might have

1017
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,460
gone ah they

1018
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,160
can make good

1019
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,500
films that are

1020
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,360
entertaining in

1021
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,160
between the

1022
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,760
big trilogy films

1023
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,220
oh I was not

1024
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,440
expecting a close

1025
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,260
reading of the

1026
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,320
Marvel v Star Wars

1027
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,480
that was not where

1028
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,220
I thought this was

1029
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:26,620
going

1030
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,660
not sure it was

1031
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,360
that close a

1032
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:28,780
reading

1033
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,420
fighting talk

1034
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,000
let's fighting

1035
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,780
talk

1036
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:39,680
Johnny you know

1037
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,080
definitely like

1038
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,200
screen sharing

1039
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:42,560
with us

1040
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,920
deliberately

1041
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,180
yes look at

1042
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,720
this graph

1043
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,280
oh I see

1044
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,120
okay

1045
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,060
this is the

1046
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,240
lockdown spike

1047
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,240
index published

1048
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,920
per month on

1049
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,980
arcumtv.com

1050
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,680
which I thought

1051
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,220
was interesting

1052
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,640
because it just

1053
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,200
rockets

1054
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,180
what's the

1055
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:56,540
graph

1056
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,900
oh yes

1057
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,920
I've been

1058
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,640
you know how

1059
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,560
people say you

1060
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,060
should not

1061
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,940
extrapolate from

1062
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,500
your personal

1063
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,820
experience to

1064
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,420
to the world

1065
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,000
in general

1066
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,920
I've been

1067
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,320
extrapolating from

1068
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,540
the things my

1069
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,100
Facebook friends

1070
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,560
talk about

1071
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,300
I have a fairly

1072
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,620
diverse large

1073
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,720
I mean they're all

1074
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,660
middle class obviously

1075
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,520
but I have a fairly

1076
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,700
diverse large group

1077
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,420
of Facebook friends

1078
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,960
and I've been

1079
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,140
extrapolating like

1080
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:21,860
mad from my

1081
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,920
Facebook friends

1082
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,580
what they've been

1083
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,140
doing and it seems

1084
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:24,740
to work out

1085
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,320
and I have now

1086
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:25,900
noticed that it

1087
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,540
also works on

1088
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,260
gaming I think

1089
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:27,840
people are gaming

1090
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,740
about three times

1091
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,360
as much as

1092
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:30,980
they did before

1093
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,480
lockdown

1094
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,540
I guess but

1095
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,340
the thing you

1096
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,000
have to bear in

1097
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,700
mind Alison is

1098
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,280
that I am

1099
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,380
responsible for

1100
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,100
how many

1101
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,760
arcum horror decks

1102
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,240
have you made

1103
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:38,660
John now how

1104
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:39,340
many of those

1105
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,300
that spike is

1106
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,080
just you

1107
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:41,900

1108
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,640
arcum horror decks

1109
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,580
uh actually no

1110
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,560
so okay so that

1111
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,220
is actually a very

1112
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:46,900
good question

1113
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,860
I will count

1114
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,880
it is not a

1115
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,800
trivial question

1116
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,820
shall we

1117
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,060

1119
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,740
and then get

1120
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,460

John is

1132
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,800
responsible for

1133
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,440
the global

1134
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,240
spike in

1135
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,420
arcum horror

1136
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:11,920

1146
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,060
