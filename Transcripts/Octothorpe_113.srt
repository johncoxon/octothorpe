00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Hi everyone, John here, just before we get going.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 Alison is about to tell you a thing, and that thing has meant that the audio on her track is very slightly worse than usual.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,840
 I've done my best with it. Hopefully it's not too catastrophic.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,560
 But sorry about that, in advance.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,120
 And onward with the show.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:25,280
 I brought my microphone and my microphone stand and my microphone cable to the place where I'm staying this weekend,

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,640
 but I did not bring the little doohickey that my microphone clips into before you were taken to the stand.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,760
 So I'm holding my microphone like a cabaret singer.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:54,840
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 113th episode of Octa Thorpe podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,040
 which is coming to you on the 4th of July 2024.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,480
 I'm John Coxen.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,000
 I'm Alison Scott.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,440
 And I'm Liz Batty.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,480
 I assume you have also posted or voted Liz.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,720
 I proxy vote actually.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,920
 Or...

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,760
 You'll be able to listen to what you thought while waiting for the election results to come in.

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,960
 I mean, I don't know how you mean by you, well, I won't.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,880
 Our listeners.

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,360
 Our listeners, this is a good distraction.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,880
 You all our listeners will be able to listen to the podcast while you're waiting for the election results to come in.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,400
 Yes, and if you are eligible to vote and you haven't voted, turn off our thoughts,

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,840
 run to the polling station.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,560
 Actually, you know you can listen to what you thought while you run to the polling station.

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,680
 Then vote, then come back.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,160
 Yeah.

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,440
 Yeah, John, you need to get this episode out before 10pm when the vote...

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,320
 False, Liz.

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,080
 It's up to you, John. We're counting on you.

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,240
 I want to hear more about Liz's proxy voting, which we interrupted in the middle of this and was interesting.

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,520
 Well, I have a proxy vote. I'm not sure if that's interesting.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,880
 It is interesting.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,480
 Well, basically you just nominate someone who has to vote at your polling station.

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,120
 So the polling station is where I would have voted before I left the UK.

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,640
 So I can nominate someone who goes to that polling station and votes for me.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,360
 And I nominated friend of the podcast, Ruth O'Reilly, who gets to go to the polling station and vote for me.

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,760
 And conveniently, she votes to the same polling station I used to.

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,600
 So basically she just gets two goes.

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,720
 Nice.

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,560
 Back back to the letters of comment.

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,800
 We have a letter of comment from Karen Schafer who processed a lot of pounds of peaches while listening to Octathor

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,240
 talking about human nominations, which is an exit news of Octathor.

43
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,640
 And if you want to send us any pitch jam, pitch cobbler, anything like that, we accept all donations.

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,840
 Peach bourbon.

45
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,880
 Peach bourbon.

46
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,320
 Oh, this one. Well, I mean, you basically take half a bottle of bourbon and you stick as many peaches as will fit

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,560
 and you wait for months and it's very, very good.

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,800
 Have you had Octathor recipe quarter?

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,560
 That does sound pretty great.

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,440
 I've also found a recipe for peach and bourbon pie, which sounds pretty great as well.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,120
 Peaches.

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,040
 Karen bounced hard off some desperate glory, but it's going to give it another go because we endorse it.

53
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,240
 So I mean, I think yay, but I hope that doesn't mean you read it and just dislike it.

54
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
 I read it because we told you to.

55
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,400
 And the same that she is reading the final architect trilogy, which I think I have endorsed quite heavily.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,600
 But we have endorsed basically all Adrian Tricoski products.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,680
 Yes. And also apparently we occasionally pronounce a word fantasy,

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,080
 which I'm pronouncing very carefully here, in a way that sounds like fancy,

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,240
 which is probably true. Probably you say fancy.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,960
 Fancy.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,920
 Fantasy, yep.

62
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,720
 Fancy.

63
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,440
 Fancy.

64
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,400
 Fantasy.

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,320
 It's because English.

66
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,160
 It's because teas are a lie.

67
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,120
 Yes. Sometimes English decides that syllables are not entirely necessary.

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,120
 It could be replaced by a glottal stop.

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,480
 Yes. And then we come up with the idea of fancy con.

70
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,840
 I would go to fancy con.

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,960
 I would go to fancy con.

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,440
 This is the sequels of fun con.

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,480
 If you did fun con, did you fancy doing fancy con then, you know.

74
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,600
 And it could be ambiguous about whether it's just a it is a fantasy con or just a fancy con.

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,920
 I assume it'd be a romance convention.

76
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,200
 It's going to have good cosplay.

77
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,440
 Why would it be a romance convention?

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,240
 A fancy con.

79
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,880
 It's about people who fancy other people.

80
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,000
 It wasn't a good joke, but it was technically a joke.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
 I mean, I feel like I've been thinking,

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,640
 what can I put on a river?

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,680
 What can I put on a river?

84
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,760
 I feel like it was technically a joke.

85
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,120
 It's not a bad choice.

86
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,360
 Yeah, that's fair.

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,520
 Christopher J Garcia wrote in saying that he had no idea.

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,720
 It was the 20th of June.

89
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,120
 So cool.

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,160
 Good Chris.

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,000
 I'm glad we could educate you.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,040
 He also says that he knows the exact image that Liz is talking about

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,880
 of the Netflix CEO.

94
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,800
 And he's pretty sure that Ted loves that vest

95
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,800
 because every time Chris sees him eating at Orin's Hummus in Las Gatos,

96
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,520
 he's either wearing that exact vest or a t-shirt from

97
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,040
 whatever the latest terrible Netflix series their slinging is.

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,160
 I just, it's the very finest name dropping.

99
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,680
 If name dropping was remarks and Spencer's, this would be it.

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,520
 It's a specificity, isn't it?

101
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,400
 Yeah.

102
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,480
 It's not just that he sees the Netflix CEO

103
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,880
 is eating at Orin's Hummus in Los Gatos.

104
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,000
 Yeah, exactly.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,760
 Which means the cats.

106
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,520
 Spanish Corner.

107
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,400
 That's a rad.

108
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,640
 Vanessa Mitalin wife loves bats so much.

109
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,320
 There are multiple framed bat skeletons in the house.

110
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,720
 That is pretty goth.

111
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,600
 And then he says,

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,680
 "Eastcon releasing financial reports is a good thing.

113
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,520
 Convention center prices are astronomical,

114
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,080
 so much so that even the middle big media cons around here

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,000
 started using hotels for their events,

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,160
 which is interesting because it's interesting to see the US kind of

117
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,400
 events going more in a British direction.

118
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,840
 I just want to say we had multiple people comment on the last episode that

119
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,800
 we had made it sound like levitation had chosen to use a conference center

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
 and that they should have used a hotel because it was cheaper.

121
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,400
 The intent was to tell people who are less familiar with Eastcons,

122
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,720
 why most Eastcons haven't used convention centers,

123
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,800
 and why this conversation is new,

124
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,240
 not to indicate that levitation had a different option.

125
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,720
 We regret any confusion caused.

126
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,200
 But we are trying to bear in mind that not everyone listening has a

127
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,960
 historical view of these events.

128
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,520
 And we're trying to give them one, but we will do better next time.

129
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,480
 Yeah, they definitely didn't have a suitable quote from a cheaper hotel,

130
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,120
 which they would probably be used if they had done.

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,200
 But yeah, that's why it is also why historically

132
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 Eastcons have not been very expensive for the amount of programming they provide.

133
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,240
 So, you know, because we were doing these deals.

134
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,560
 America gets to do what has been described by Chris because

135
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,120
 America has these enormous hotels.

136
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,920
 Yes.

137
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,080
 And Britain does not have hotels the ties of a small city.

138
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,360
 You know, I've lived in villages smaller than the high at Regency Chicago.

139
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,400
 Chris ramps up his lock by saying he hasn't seen the latest Godzilla,

140
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,120
 but he's considering a chronological rewatch with the kids.

141
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,400
 And I can't remember whether this made it into the episode last week.

142
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,800
 But there are 38 of them, Chris, like in what order and which one are you skipping any?

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,120
 And like, do you mean chronological in release order or in internal chronology?

144
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,800
 Like, please write in with a full and detailed plan.

145
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,880
 I'm not sure they're all suitable for kids.

146
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,520
 And then I think it's Alison with Peter Sullivan's lock.

147
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,640
 I'm not sure that Peter Sullivan's lock is a lock, actually, so much as a plug.

148
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,200
 He says, "I've planned for online for Glasgow, coming long nicely.

149
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,320
 We will have 10 streams of program from the convention itself,

150
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,880
 plus two more online-only streams.

151
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,560
 We've also taken onboard Alison Scott."

152
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,520
 Who is that?

153
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,040
 Alison Scott's first line of online socials, TM,

154
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,520
 which I would basically summarize as, quote,

155
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,560
 "They don't just happen.

156
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,680
 You need to provide some sort of framework," end quote.

157
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,160
 And so they have assigned a designated person for socials on Discord.

158
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,960
 And I believe that person is John Coxon.

159
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,160
 Hey.

160
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,720
 Yeah.

161
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,280
 Well done.

162
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,240
 That's all sounds good.

163
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,760
 I personally will not be my second law of online socials for in-person conventions

164
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,880
 is that you have to have people who are not actually going to be at the

165
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,120
 convention in person in charge of the online,

166
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,200
 because the people who are at the convention are probably going to be a bit busy.

167
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,320
 But, you know.

168
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,120
 So are you thought the person who's going to sit in the SECC

169
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,960
 connecting people in Glasgow to people online?

170
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,160
 Is that the idea?

171
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,880
 No.

172
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,920
 What are you doing then?

173
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,320
 My plan is to spool up the Discord some time beforehand

174
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,960
 and to get people talking on the Discord,

175
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,800
 so that by the time we get to the convention,

176
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,080
 we don't have to do that, because people are doing it themselves.

177
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,120
 Oh, I see.

178
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,880
 Because I think if you start trying to get people to talk on the Thursday of the Glasgow,

179
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,840
 of Glasgow, where everyone at Glasgow is ignoring Discord,

180
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,400
 that is a plan that is doomed to fail.

181
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,880
 And so that is not my plan.

182
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,400
 We're going to do a scavenger hunt,

183
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,400
 and we're going to do choose your own adventure if I run the zucon

184
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,680
 so that people can do it, and then we're going to get Esther to do it later,

185
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,920
 and we're going to see whether she does better than the denizens of the Glasgow Discord.

186
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,360
 Oh.

187
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:08,600
 And we're going to have a sort of chaos costuming thing during the convention.

188
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,240
 We wanted to do like a Hugo Red carpet, but I don't think they work very well.

189
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,880
 I think it's a nice idea that everyone ignores, basically.

190
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,200
 Okay.

191
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,360
 Are you going to have a scavenger hunt with most items,

192
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,960
 which you can find not at the convention,

193
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,080
 but a couple of items that you can find at the convention so that it needs teams

194
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,720
 that have both on the line and online offline people?

195
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:32,280
 No, because the scavenger hunts will be happening before the worldcon,

196
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,200
 because at the worldcon, there will be quite a lot already happening.

197
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,920
 The idea of most of what I'm doing is trying to get people on the Discord in advance,

198
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,960
 and making people feel like the Discord is a place they want to be talking,

199
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,760
 because as I say, if I think I'm relying on people online,

200
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,920
 nagging people on site to pay attention, I've already lost.

201
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,520
 Is my strong feeling.

202
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,400
 And then we have Kat Corbet from Liz.

203
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,840
 Yes, we have a letter from Kat Corbetty,

204
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,960
 who listened while she was at the gym on the treadmill.

205
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,280
 See, we're full of like healthy options here.

206
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,880
 People listen while they're going for walks,

207
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,400
 they listen while they're on the treadmill.

208
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,040
 They listen while they're pressing peaches.

209
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,760
 They record while they're in pancakes.

210
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,560
 Yep, John records while he is eating pancakes,

211
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,040
 and every time this happens, I get very sad,

212
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,600
 because this banner is not bringing me pancakes.

213
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,240
 Yes, to return to Kat's letter, she suggests more George McKay goodness,

214
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,400
 including Sunshine on Leith, a Pratlamas jukebox musical.

215
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,360
 Femme, in which he plays a closeted gay thug who attacks a drag queen

216
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,760
 and ends up being seduced by her out of drag,

217
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,960
 which she says is phenomenal, it does sound phenomenal.

218
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,640
 He's in 1917, the World War I film shot in a single take,

219
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,040
 and apparently he has also in another SFN film, How I Live Now.

220
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,760
 So there you go, if you want a George McKay cat-drop list,

221
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
 we have one provided by our listeners.

222
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,680
 Mike Scott writes, "The large games convention that Allison attended in the 1980s was Gamesfair,

223
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,840
 organised by TSR in Reading long before they sold out to Wizards of the Coast.

224
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,440
 It seems to have almost disappeared from the historical record,

225
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,640
 which is what I'd found.

226
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,160
 It was probably the 1984 one, I think it was the 1985 one in fact,

227
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,280
 because we didn't do East Columbia and I think we did do Gamesfair."

228
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,880
 Yeah, so yes, it was Gamesfair, it wasn't that huge, but compared to modern conventions,

229
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,240
 but it was quite big, much bigger than the Stabcon.

230
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,080
 "And you can buy on eBay ends in two days and two hours,

231
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,120
 so it might not still be there, but I'll put a link on the show notes if it is.

232
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,040
 You can buy the Gamesfair 85 AD&D team competition module on eBay,

233
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,840
 The Great Paladin Hunt by Mike Brunton."

234
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,440
 How much would I buy it for?

235
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,040
 11 pounds 20.

236
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,480
 Oh, so if I wanted it, it wouldn't be that much, because it, you know,

237
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,920
 so if you're a rare D&D stuff collector, then, I mean, it wasn't,

238
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,360
 I was just doing tabletop all weekend, I didn't do any, do you do as far as I remember?

239
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,360
 Fair, I just googled Gamesfair 1985 and the only thing that came up was that one thing on eBay.

240
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,640
 Malcolm Hutchison writes in saying we were discussing East Kong's at Worldcon years and

241
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,760
 their Morship numbers and he points out that the 2014 East Kong probably had a boost from initially

242
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,200
 having to approach it as a special guest of honor, and that is a good point.

243
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,760
 Johnny Bradley writes, "Aliceson, you made me blush. It would not be the first time, Johnny."

244
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,600
 And he has pointed out that my husband Stephen knows no fear.

245
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,080
 A man who will air saxophone, yakety-sax, ain't afraid of napping.

246
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,640
 And there is quite a funny video, but I'm not sure it's available, though,

247
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,760
 if you follow the, if you follow our Facebook group, then Ivan, who ran the item, has said,

248
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,320
 "Oh yes, I have videos, so there are videos." It was very funny item.

249
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,040
 It sounds good.

250
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,960
 Fun facts, Stephen strained various muscles at Funcon and I had not previously thought about

251
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,680
 the air saxophone being one of the causative occasions for that, but it might want to be.

252
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:26,520
 Glasgow in 2024. I had an email from Glasgow and I think there are some people who have had

253
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,720
 this email. I had not had it yet, so I've had it now, asking me to fill in the confirmation of

254
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,560
 participation email, and they will say, "They said that they hoped to send me my provisional

255
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,040
 schedule in the second week of July." So next episode, we might be able to report what's on it.

256
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,240
 But yes, I know there were some people who were a bit worried that they hadn't had this yet,

257
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,960
 but like I think it's coming out in stages, so if I had mentioned I'd received mine, Liz and

258
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:59,880
 Alison, have you had anything from Glasgow? Yes. Way. Mine says, "We are delighted to welcome you as

259
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,720
 a confirmed programme participant, which is presumably the email, and it says, 'We hope to send you

260
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:13,480
 your provisional schedule by the end of June.' So I wonder if they have revised that prediction

261
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,000
 since sending mine, because they sent me that on the 17th of June, which is some time ago.

262
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,680
 So I might be fairly early in that process. And they may have gone, 'Ooh, the end of June, that's

263
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,040
 pushing it a bit.' Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's really, I mean, I have inside a knowledge anyway

264
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,640
 what was being on the programme team, which means I have been scanning Planarama looking for

265
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,560
 participants and stuff, and everyone has little flags saying like what status they're in, so I

266
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,760
 kind of knew if everyone's been accepted or what. But I don't think it's going to say that like

267
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,680
 they will prioritise people, they expect to use a programme like say Hugo finalists,

268
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,720
 and possibly they also did it in Alphabetic Lorda, which is why it's so strictly high up.

269
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,840
 Hey, it's for Alison. Yes. We always alphabetise our letter of comment contributors by first name.

270
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,240
 That's not true, is it? It is true. Is it? Yep. John, look at our letters of comment, they're not

271
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:15,240
 alphabetised. Look at the show notes for episodes 112, 111, 109, 108. No, wait, are you

272
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,840
 alphabetising them in the show notes? Yeah. So they're not in the order that we actually read them out

273
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,440
 on the on the show? No. You absolute mad lad, what are you doing?

274
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:34,360
 So we read the matter to give an order based on how we think we'll make a good show,

275
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,040
 and then for doing the show notes, you then put them back into alphabetical order

276
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,040
 so that people can find their figure the index, but we'll have to listen to the

277
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,440
 entire show to work out what we've actually said about them. Yeah, I mean, I don't think knowing

278
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,520
 what order they're in in the show meaningfully makes it faster to find a specific one anyway,

279
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,920
 because it's not like you know how long we spend on each. I guess I could put a chapter marker in.

280
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,800
 No, no, don't do that. Where did this end, John? Are you just going to start putting

281
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,320
 pics at the beginning of the show notes? You know alphabetical order? No, because letter, yeah,

282
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:15,880
 L comes before P-list. Oh, oh, but then we'd always do well-con at the end. Yeah. Ahead of only

283
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:23,880
 yachting and if at what if we do Glasgow, just like our first then? No, because G is after like A,

284
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,400
 so if we did odd part, sadbing before Glasgow. Anyway, other funny animals are available.

285
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,880
 None as funny as an odd vark. Oh, to be fair, it's deeply inconsistent because you only have

286
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,320
 to go back like six and you find what I forgot to do it. So, so fun fact, there is currently a

287
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,440
 humble bundle for the whole of Syrabus the odd vark by Dave Sim. And this is occasioned much

288
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,960
 discussion on online forums I'm in about whether any of Syrabus is worth reading or whether the

289
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:58,520
 entire thing is irrevocably dood by the fact that Dave Simbeth went a bit bananas part way

290
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,000
 through the run and got increasingly unhinged the more of it he wrote.

291
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,960
 Didn't someone just finish like a complete review of Syrabus? Like they read all of it

292
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,720
 and wrote about it in detail. Does anyone know what I'm thinking about? I do not. I'm looking for

293
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 Syrabus review and there's a ton, there's a problem. Hmm, I will try and find it.

294
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,640
 It will either be in the show notes or if it is not in the show notes, please write in.

295
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,080
 Yeah, if we put a link we found it and if we didn't we haven't.

296
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,000
 Yeah, so uh, Syliz, am I going to be on any program?

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,640
 I can't tell you. Oh, it's a secret.

298
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,320
 Secretless. You'll just have to tune in next time.

299
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,760
 Yeah, soon we will know. I can't go around telling people things. I also

300
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,400
 sign the thing saying I would not just like use Planarama for frivolous reasons,

301
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,760
 look at people's email addresses and stuff like that. So I actually don't know.

302
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,320
 Yeah, I wasn't, I wasn't asking you to tell me like Neil Gaym is email address.

303
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,680
 I feel like my my proposed infraction of the date of policies was I think quite me specific.

304
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,880
 All right, do we want to talk, are we got anything else on Glasgow?

305
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,560
 I'm excited about Glasgow.

306
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,960
 I could say I am collecting a lot of combages at the moment.

307
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,840
 I am drowning in combages. People, people keep saying, oh, would you like some combages from this

308
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,520
 con? I discovered that there was a series of cons conventions, not only had I never heard of them.

309
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,000
 In general, student-run conventions in Britain that I had never heard of, but they were 11 off the

310
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,800
 which is quite a lot. So this project turned out to be quite a bit bigger than I thought.

311
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,880
 It started when we were given a large posthumous donation of combages and it was said, would the

312
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,120
 fan funds like to do something with this? And and instead of what we should have done, which was

313
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,600
 go, yes, we would like to put them unexamined into the into the bin. We said, oh, it would be good to do

314
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,000
 a display for Glasgow about convention badges. So there's going to be a display at Glasgow about

315
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,840
 British and European convention badges, probably. And in support of this, I've been collecting British

316
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,400
 and European convention badges in order to not go bad. I have decided arbitrarily that these are

317
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,560
 fan-run conventions and that they are conventions about science fiction and fantasy and related

318
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:12,280
 subjects generally, rather than the works of a particular show or author, because actually it's a

319
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,800
 huge job even with a general brief. And then after the WorldCon, I may be going to expand that to

320
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,960
 include all of the other conventions, the Star Trek conventions and the Discworld conventions and

321
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,520
 the H.H.I.K.S. conventions and all of those conventions. But at the moment, it is just kind of all of the

322
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,920
 it is for general conventions. And I've got quite a lot and it is not going to be complete at all.

323
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,520
 So the title of this display is provisionally an extremely incomplete guide to the convention

324
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,160
 badges of Britain and Europe. And it's lots of fun in a kind of, oh God, did I need another large

325
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,760
 project inserted in my life this close to the WorldCon? To which the answer is no. But there we go.

326
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,960
 I've also done the guest of Honor exhibit for Claremark, so that is done and has been delivered

327
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,680
 very early. So that is not because of me, that is because of Claremark who were very efficient

328
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,560
 in giving me everything I needed to do it. And so I think it's fair to say that if you have any

329
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,520
 combatges you don't want, bring them to Glasgow and give them to Alison as a surprise.

330
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,280
 You know, actually that's fine. But don't be surprised if I then put them straight in the bin.

331
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,280
 I mean, the fanfants probably does want your collection of combatges, but please,

332
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,600
 please remove weird, you know, not if they're weirdly stained unless it's a very rare badge.

333
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,440
 Are you just doing the badges or is it badges and people's giant ribbon collections?

334
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,240
 I am not doing giant ribbon collections at all. I think I've decided I don't really care. I think

335
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,480
 there is another project that in actually collecting and documenting and his terrifying

336
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,160
 convention ribbons I think is quite interesting. But I am not going to be that person at least not

337
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,680
 this year or next year. Well, the year after. Probably not the year after. But I mean, if

338
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,640
 nobody's picked up that fan historical idea, I think it's partly my feeling that a lot of the

339
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,800
 fan historical material is very text based. And I would like to see us do a better job of collecting

340
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:08,600
 the artistic illustrative material around fan history than we are currently doing.

341
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,800
 But I don't want to be the entire person who does this because, you know, I have other things.

342
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 But I'm happy to do this. But it did grow into a much bigger project than I was thinking about.

343
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,280
 Right. That's that's all I'm well con. After that, my only remaining world con task is to

344
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,760
 organize the fan fun tables in the dealer's room. If you have been a fan fund delegate,

345
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,680
 if you think fan funds are interesting, if you're coming to Glasgow and if you'd like to do a

346
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,080
 couple of hours on the table, we would really appreciate it. Let me know that sound, you know,

347
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,960
 because we need lots of people. We're going to have three tables. We'll need quite a lot of people

348
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,920
 to help. And it's going to be a lot of fun because being in the dealer's room is fun and having

349
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,160
 being on the fan fund tables is fun. That's it. That's all I'm doing at Worldcon, I think.

350
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,800
 Fair enough. And I have got to the stage in my life where people keep emailing me with questions

351
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,960
 about the world con despite the fact that I'm not actually working on the Worldcon at all,

352
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,360
 which is interesting. This is because every time anyone mentions the Worldcon, you have several

353
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,200
 opinions. And so they know that if they email you about the Worldcon, you will have opinions,

354
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,360
 and so they might as well email you to get the opinions. And if you want them to stop,

355
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,120
 there's a clear and obvious route that I think will never happen. Do you think?

356
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,680
 Most of the time I'm saying to people, why don't you ask this question in the Glasgow

357
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:26,280
 Community Group on Facebook? I repeat, the Glasgow Worldcon Community Group on Facebook,

358
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:32,840
 which is an excellent place to ask questions like, why is my Baldur's Gate 3 code not working?

359
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,600
 Where is there a laundrette near the SEC? Or did you know that someone posted this funny meme about

360
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,760
 Haggis last week? Except don't post funny Haggis memes because that group is going to get more

361
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,200
 and more active for the next month, right? Let's not clog it up entirely with Haggis memes.

362
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,280
 Let's only partly clog it up with Haggis memes. Okay, octavort listeners, if you have a Haggis meme

363
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:03,560
 you don't want to do. No, I realised too late what I'd done. There's the last name in it, the

364
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:10,200
 the Streisand effect. Streisand effect? Where you say something should not be a thing everyone talks

365
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,920
 about and you saying the thing means that everyone talks about it. Named after Barbara Streisand who

366
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,280
 asked people to stop talking about where she lived and that caused an awful lot of attention to be

367
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,360
 diverted to the topic of where she lived.

368
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:37,240
 Since we last recorded, or actually one of these came out before we last recorded, we just forgot

369
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,320
 to mention it. The winners of the Locust and Nebula Awards have been announced. So they have

370
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,680
 announced the Nebula's and Locust Award which I guess from my perspective is partly interesting

371
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,520
 because it's a good way of, it's a good sort of prediction for the Hugos. And I've got to say,

372
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:01,400
 say in the Nebula Awards, the St. Bright Doors won Best Novel, which I was not necessarily expecting

373
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,960
 given that Anlechia and Martha Wells are both in that category. So I think that both are well

374
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,600
 for the St. Bright Doors at the Hugo. Best Novel Act was the year without Sunshine, which I was fully

375
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,200
 accepting, expecting to scoop every ward because I think Naomi Kritzer has that and also better

376
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,280
 living through algorithms, which is also on the Hugo Ballot, Anel, the Nebula Ballot.

377
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:28,840
 We're both kind of, they're good stories but they have this particular vibe which is like

378
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,120
 people working together as communities is a good thing and the story is basically

379
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:40,520
 asked, stories of how people start working together more and that is good and nice. And in fact,

380
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,640
 the novel that's in the Locust Award, Liberty's Daughter, is a little bit of that. So I, and I think

381
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,000
 that is something that the Hugo's kind of likes to reward. I think they definitely have a soft spot

382
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 for well-written good stories which have a sort of hopeful community binding message. And so, so I

383
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,760
 slightly surprised when it did not win Best Novel Act in the Locust Awards, it went to the Rainbow

384
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,600
 Bank by Ochechicu Nwaka from Giga Nautosaurus, which I actually haven't read or heard anything

385
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:16,920
 about but it won the Locust Award. So, I guess my take-home messages, the Nebbers and Locusts are

386
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,120
 probably a good prediction of what's going to win the Hugos except for when they are a terrible

387
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:28,440
 prediction of what's going to win the Hugos. I think it is interesting that St. Abright Doors

388
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,720
 won Best Novel of the Nebula's and Best First Novel at the Locust Awards. It is also interesting

389
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:43,160
 that some desperate glory did not even get nominated in the Nebbers and lost out to St. Abright

390
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,920
 Doors in First Novel in the Locust Awards. So yeah, we will see if that presages things in the Hugos

391
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:55,720
 as this says. Also, Baldur's Gate 3 won Best Game Rating at the Nebbers and I have started

392
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,400
 playing Baldur's Gate 3 and I've played one hour of Baldur's Gate 3 and I suspected is going at the

393
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,520
 bottom of my interactive work ballot because it is not my cup of tea.

394
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:13,480
 Are you off the spaceship yet? No. I think I've just triggered, oh no I am. I had to watch a very

395
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,880
 there was a very long cutscene and then I was on a spaceship with sphincters and then there was

396
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,000
 another very long cutscene and now I'm on a beach. Okay, so that is all that has happened in the first

397
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,200
 hour. I would say there's a no cutscene in Baldur's Gate 3 has yet to be let it seem like as long as

398
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,560
 the cutscene in Horizon Zero Dawn that almost caused me to give up the game permanently.

399
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:43,320
 But that was just one. The point is that Horizon Zero Dawn concentrated its cutscenes into one

400
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,760
 incredibly long lump of exposition about halfway through. But also Horizon Zero Dawn's cutscenes

401
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:55,640
 had characters in that I cared about which is one quite big difference so far. Yeah, so you're

402
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,760
 gonna care about some of these characters but you don't care about them yet do you is the point

403
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,240
 about Baldur's Gate 3. I've met some people but I immediately unmet them again and they all seem

404
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,400
 terrible. I'm not saying it's a bad game everyone loves it it's clearly a great game but oh I'm not

405
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,320
 sure it's a John game. That's interesting because I always thought you were way more into narrative

406
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:25,480
 in games than I am so. I am that's why I don't like it. Read us write it. I think if there hasn't been

407
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,560
 it feels like so far and I'm hoping this gets better and I will keep playing it to see if it gets

408
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,880
 better but so far it feels like a bad Captain America movie but fantasy. So it feels like the

409
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,800
 level of writing of the MCU but like two steps down and in a genre I don't really care for and I'm

410
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,800
 like is this the pinnacle of games in science fiction because because I would argue no but but

411
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,000
 as I say lots of people love it so maybe I just haven't got to the good beat yet. Yeah I liked it

412
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,880
 much more once I got into the gaming game but you know as I said it's clearly not my game either so

413
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,760
 I didn't pick it last week but I picked it because you know I was just so amazed that I could play

414
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,880
 it on my Mac which then died so I don't know whether those two facts were collected. And then

415
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,720
 the other one is Two Shape A Draggers Breath 1 the Norton Nebula Award for Middle Grade a Young

416
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,040
 Adult. I have been reading that it's quite good. There's no other crossover between the load star

417
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:28,920
 and the nebula so I suspect it is the only Norton finalist I will read. Yeah but also then in the

418
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,600
 Locust Awards Charlie G and Anders promised to stronger than Darkness 1 which is also a loads

419
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:41,400
 star nominee. Yes I read the first of that trilogy when it was up for the Hugo and I thought it was

420
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:48,920
 okay. I will also say at the Locust Awards congratulations to Tor for winning Best Publisher

421
00:28:48,920 --> 00:29:00,600
 for the 25th year in a row. Get rid of the category. There's no point. We know Tor's a publisher.

422
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,480
 We know they're good. The nominees are interesting though right because the nominees do include

423
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,560
 things like Neon Hemlock who are a very sort of small press who published a lot of interesting

424
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:17,640
 looking novels and novellas. Hello everyone John here after we recorded this but before it went live

425
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,000
 the most recent Locust editorial says that the Tor Publishing Group which includes Tor.com publishing

426
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,760
 as well has recused itself from consideration for the Locust Award Best Publisher for a few years

427
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:34,680
 quote to allow others to shine unquote and they note that this year's award is in fact the 37th

428
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:41,000
 that Tor has won. Applause for this classy move which we will talk more about next time.

429
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,280
 Commiserations to all these world reviews and essays by Neil Harrison in the Locust Awards

430
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:53,480
 which did not win. It lost to a person a little known person in the genre called Ursula K. Le Guin.

431
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,880
 If you're going to lose there are worse people to whom you might but I'm expecting people to come

432
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:07,160
 out for the hugos. Vote Neil unless you don't want to in which case don't but I think you should want

433
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,680
 to. I think your campaign slogan needs a little bit of work John.

434
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,440
 Possibly. I had a lot of space chrome being discussed in discussions of what one might

435
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,640
 vote for this year in non-fiction categories. Nope I never heard of it. I've heard of it now but

436
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,520
 you know. Part of the reason I do a podcast is because most of my non-fiction is in podcast form

437
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:37,240
 may not be surprising. I had not heard of it because I'm not sure I'm particularly well read

438
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,520
 in that regard. So what you're saying is that Neil should start a podcast for you.

439
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:50,920
 Yeah I have told him that repeatedly but it is not taken. He was on I think critical friends right?

440
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,320
 Yeah.

441
00:30:51,320 --> 00:31:03,720
 Right so since the last time we recorded there has been an announcement of a bid for a world

442
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:11,000
 convention in Brisbane in 2028. This is not being a real I think by Brisbane fans if you're a Brisbane

443
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,440
 fan writing but by fans from around Australia who have put together a bid they the committee is

444
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,560
 chaired by random Jones who I do not know but also includes on the main committee Eureech,

445
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:31,640
 G, Green and Tax both of whom I met on my guff trip and liked very much and so obviously that's a

446
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,560
 great reason to to think people will be able to run a world con. It's not necessarily but they seem

447
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,680
 to be sensible interesting people with a lot of good ideas when I met them and there are a number

448
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:46,520
 of other people involved and also an advisory committee which includes Rose Mitchell and

449
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:52,360
 Perimidleness who are previous Aussie con chairs and they are running they are hoping to hold Aussie

450
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,240
 con 5 which is a thing where they've actually said this which is not normally done but they're

451
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,720
 running they're hoping to run Aussie con 5 in 2028 in Brisbane and if they succeed in that day they'll

452
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:10,040
 be they'll be bidding at the 2026 World con we don't know where the 26 World con will be but the only

453
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,800
 site that has filed papers is Los Angeles so they will be bidding in Los Angeles to hold the World

454
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,360
 con in Brisbane and if they win I will try and get to the World con in Brisbane because I still kind

455
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,760
 of want to go to a World con in Australia or New Zealand not having managed to do so in 1990

456
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:33,720
 in 1990 2020 my brain is completely fried guys I have reached senility another year has turned on

457
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,600
 the year clock and I'm clearly heading down the slippery slope anyway they they don't currently

458
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,080
 have a method of joining them or paying them any money but they do have a Facebook page you

459
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,480
 could go enjoy to learn more about the bit and they do also have a web page and we will dig into

460
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,560
 those things in the show notes I think I know what you mean about people don't usually announce what

461
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:01,480
 the name of the convention will be but I think a careful read of the previous names of Australian

462
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,840
 World cons probably could have had a stab anyway so for the listener they were called Aussie con 1

463
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,800
 Aussie con 2 Aussie con 3 Aussie con 4 it's a good brand so and they're hoping to have a table at

464
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,240
 Glasgow I should probably have said this and obviously I'm looking forward to meeting all the

465
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,240
 people I met at Australia again in Glasgow lots of Australia fans are going to be in Glasgow which

466
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,960
 is very exciting to me see you all there guys I think this bit is basically not connected to the

467
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:37,480
 previous Perth in 2025 bit I think this is a new thing that's spun up right Brisbane in 2025

468
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,000
 I think it was Brisbane in 2025 as well Brisbane's got a right sized convention centre and the

469
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,040
 thing about Brisbane is it somewhere that's the weather's pretty good in the middle of winter

470
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,640
 for running a World con so I think it's got a good a good choice of location all right there

471
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,680
 was definitely at some point a Perth in 2025 bit so this is and then there was also when Brisbane

472
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,920
 in 2025 bit so now we're on Brisbane in 2028 okay they announced the Perth 2025 bid

473
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:12,280
 before Dublin and then by Dublin that was on hiatus and then that bid folded and the Brisbane

474
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:19,480
 bid came about in 2025 and now it is Brisbane in 2028 so it was PRK who launched the Perth

475
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,520
 bid and they're on the advisory committee for Brisbane in 2028 and 2025 the Brisbane in 2025

476
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:33,560
 one was Devin Madsen and Leaf Leaf I don't know how to pronounce your name I'm sorry Shell Cross

477
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:40,920
 and I don't and neither of them are on the committee or the advisory committee for Brisbane in 2028 now

478
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:47,560
 so I don't know internal Australian politics presumably if you are Australian and internal

479
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:53,960
 right in so the current line up of World Conbid for the next few years we know 2026

480
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:01,240
 Los Angeles Anaheim is the only bidder 2027 is currently Montreal versus Tel Aviv I haven't

481
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,600
 heard anything from Tel Aviv for a while but I suspect that's going to be Montreal's yeah I would

482
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:15,800
 be surprised if a Tel Aviv World Conbid won the bid session next year yeah 2028 is now Brisbane

483
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:24,440
 versus the Kampala Uganda bid yeah and then 2029 is Dublin currently unopposed that does appear to

484
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:32,040
 be correct in previous years there have been persistent repeated but ultimately doomed bids from

485
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,680
 France and Japan which have made it seem like there are a lot more bids happening but whenever you

486
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,080
 go to their parties it's like this isn't probably actually going to be a thing is it because there's

487
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,800
 like two people and a small tub of beer and so it's tricky because I think in the last decade it has

488
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,920
 seemed like there are more but I do wonder whether the number of like actual going concerns is staying

489
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,240
 about the same and there are just few people fewer people doing it sort of speculatively but I would

490
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:08,120
 still love to see a nice World Con I would love I would love to go to France World Con yeah is there

491
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:16,680
 anything in 2030 and beyond nothing in 2030 so far there is Texas in 2031 yes why are they not

492
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,320
 running 2030 because they don't want to okay and then presumably there will be UK in 2034

493
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:33,640
 and then I mean place your bets now as to whether or not I'm high but New York in 2039 I have no idea

494
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:41,640
 you'd hope there's a lot of enthusiasm for it but it's it's quite complicated

495
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,960
 is yeah and it's going to be interesting to see what the Irish what the Irish fans do

496
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:54,360
 because they have carved the nine out but if they are up against New York in 39 I do not think

497
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,040
 Dublin will beat New York so I don't know they'll be interesting to see how that shakes out but it

498
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,440
 might just be that there isn't a New York bid the reason for newer listeners or listeners who are

499
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,280
 less familiar with World Con history the reason we are discussing New York in 2039 is because the

500
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:17,560
 first World Con was in New York in 1939 and fandom does like an anniversary right yes I'm reminded of

501
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:24,200
 the Olympics where they were very very keen to get the Olympics back to Athens for the 100th

502
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,560
 year anniversary but it just did not come together they did later but but there was all this oh well

503
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,280
 Athens will definitely get it from I guess it was 1996 and of course it didn't it was just

504
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,080
 impossible and and that might happen with New York because putting a World Con in New York is

505
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:45,960
 quite hard so but I'm sure people would love to see it if it was possible I don't know 2039 it's

506
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,440
 a long way away I don't know what I'll be doing in 2039 it's a long long time it is a long way away

507
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,600
 it is a long way away it is and remember 2073 is getting closer the reason Alison says that is

508
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:04,520
 because there is a Minneapolis in 2073 bid which was initially extremely funny and presumably gets

509
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,280
 a bit less funny with each passing decade. Transitioned to a real bid some time ago it was like when

510
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,040
 they failed to win in 1973 or whether 1973 bid didn't come together they were like oh well we will

511
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,320
 you must run again and they were like 100% will run again we will run for Minneapolis in 2073

512
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,720
 and the funny thing about time is that if you if you just don't do anything it just kind of carries

513
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,760
 it anyway. There is an email newsletter I read since we are now in like there are an a sense of

514
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:40,360
 internet email newsletters got put onto it actually because of a post they did about a graphic designer

515
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:47,080
 called Barbara Salfatcher Solomon who died a few months ago who did the entrance of SF MoMA if you

516
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,320
 remember that John with all the red and the black phrase tracking signs anyway even more of a

517
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:58,760
 digression that this email newsletter is all about the preparations for the LA 2028 Olympics and kind

518
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,960
 of what that means for LA and the surroundings because the idea of LA was you know the previous

519
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,080
 one was oh we can do this on the cheap will reuse existing venues I think it's still the only

520
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:15,320
 Olympics to make a profit and so the idea of going back in 2028 is you know can they do that again

521
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,600
 and the Olympics is on a completely different scale but it is another event that is running into

522
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,520
 well this is expensive where can we hold it what do you actually need how many of the things we

523
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,920
 kind of assume you have to do for the Olympics actually have to happen that that kind of thing

524
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,000
 and I find it quite interesting although occasionally a bit inside baseball on things like how you pay

525
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,720
 for bus tickets in LA it's good it's called torch by a lister walker. It's such nice please put a link

526
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:48,280
 in the show notes in this part of the podcast which we're talking about the Antipides. If you are in

527
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,640
 the Antipides or if you like the Antipides and you are free this weekend the New Zealand

528
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,120
 Nikon is happening on the 6th of July it is happening online and we will put a link in the

529
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,280
 show notes I went to this latter I was one of the online guests of honor at it and it was very good

530
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:09,160
 fun and I kind of time shifted a bit for it and it is also in person in Wellington so if you're in

531
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,960
 or near Wellington which most New Zealand fans are then you've got an actual convention to go to

532
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,960
 this weekend for the first time in quite a long time so and if you're otherwise in a time zone

533
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,720
 that's New Zealand compatible then then there's a convention going on virtually as well and if

534
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,720
 you're listening to this I think you've got like one day to buy a ticket before they close memberships

535
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:36,600
 so yeah get on it oh yes though you need to get on to it yeah you're walking you're walking to the

536
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,240
 voting center but stop stop walking to the voting center buy your membership to this and then

537
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,240
 keep going unless time is not on your side in which case do it the other way round but don't

538
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:54,520
 vote for the Nikon remember to take your photo ID with you yes to both to both I don't know if

539
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,680
 you need it for the for the New Zealand that card but you need it to vote um right yes and

540
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:06,280
 congratulations to New Zealand for getting their national conventions back rolling more conventions

541
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:13,640
 more news more zealand's

542
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:20,920
 true do picks my pick this week is a video game that is the video game which I started playing

543
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,560
 well I got a bit bored of Baldur's Gate 3 which was slightly after two weeks ago's episode this is

544
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:34,520
 a game called animal well and in this game you are in a well and there are a lot of animals and I'm

545
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,000
 following up the John descriptive game descriptions

546
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,080
 file do you want a little bit more than that no it you play as a tiny little blob and it is a

547
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:51,960
 sort of game called a metroidvania which I think obviously people are kind of extremely steep to

548
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,360
 games will immediately know what I mean by that but for everybody else it is a game where you are

549
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:04,360
 um jumping around and moving around a little 2D area and every so often you find a thing that

550
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,480
 will help you solve some of the puzzles in the area that you are in and also help you with some

551
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,000
 of the puzzles elsewhere of the thing and there are great many puzzles and a great many secrets

552
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,280
 but I am enjoying it very much and I am very much expecting to continue to have fun as I go through

553
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,360
 it's getting a little bit harder but I'm still making progress every time I pick it up well

554
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,200
 these games tend to get to a point where I stop making progress without having to check the

555
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,480
 internet and I think that's a bit boring I don't want to be checking the internet all the time

556
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,880
 and also I have an OLED switch and this is the first game I've played that

557
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,640
 we're really having really dark blacks are really nice for the game so it looks really really good

558
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,560
 on OLED if you have an OLED screen to play it on some steam and switch and other things I don't

559
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,520
 know I should probably have checked what things it was on it is on steam and switch and ps5 because

560
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:56,760
 I just checked if I can play it yes and it's it's fabulous oh so anyway this is my this is my first

561
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,400
 here is a copper bottomed choice for the 2025 best game or interactive design Hugo in my view

562
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,280
 because it's there's not going to be six games I enjoy more than this this year okay I am going

563
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:15,480
 to pick Alan Wake 2 which completes our group picking of all of the interactive work finalists

564
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,720
 that we are going to play we haven't played the Zelda so we're probably not going to pick the Zelda

565
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,760
 would be my guess and there's Liz has been like frantically playing Zelda and I'm just unaware

566
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:31,400
 which is not impossible but yes no she's shaking her head Alan Wake 2 is real good I like it a lot

567
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,640
 it is bloody terrifying I played a little bit before bed the other day and that was a mistake

568
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:47,240
 I would not do that Alan Wake 2 is about a lady called saga and she has and I cannot stress this

569
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:55,880
 enough an amazing jumper saga jumper Alan Wake 2 Anderson

570
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:04,920
 saga Anderson yes it does not initially include anyone by the name of Alan Wake and I have not

571
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,520
 played the first Alan Wake so I was you know there are messages there are like there are hints

572
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:18,280
 as to who Alan Wake might be and there's definitely weird stuff going on and you play a bit and

573
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:27,080
 it gets weirder it definitely gets weirder I really like it I'm not good at it okay so the website

574
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:33,480
 the Alan Wake 2 website includes a knitting pattern good the official knitting patterns for sagas

575
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:41,640
 it looks like a fairly ordinary Icelandic type jumper of the sort that Anna Fruilliedaldan knocks

576
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,040
 off in a couple of days I love that there's an eating guide that's amazing if you're watching

577
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:54,680
 this Anna John would like a saga Anderson sweat of Christmas I am I like say I'm really enjoying

578
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:02,600
 Alan Wake 2 it's really good I think it might be second on my baller but it is I'm really struggling

579
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,480
 to work out which I like best out of chance of sennar and Alan Wake 2 I will say that John

580
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,920
 texted me and he said this game is a perfect storm of all the things Alison does not like it

581
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,280
 video games Alison would absolutely test this game I stand by that yeah I can't play it because

582
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,200
 although there are codes at the Hugo Pack I do not have the necessary hardware to play it with

583
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:29,560
 but it does sound like as a primarily narrative game with limited gameplay choices with the horror

584
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:36,440
 theme that is really unsettling it's probably not my game no so Liz picked chance of sennar on a

585
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:42,600
 previous episode and I have now played it as it was in the pack um and I I did adore it I thought

586
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:48,040
 it was really really good um I'd be very happy to see it win the the category I think it's very

587
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:53,000
 good but I I also really like Alan Wake but they're quite different games and I'm really struggling

588
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,480
 to think which one I like best so I like them both a great deal I think at the moment and I

589
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,960
 have just looked and I lied to you listeners because I have not yet picked Star Wars Jedi

590
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:10,600
 Survivor yeah no you haven't and I will pick that next episode I guess so I won't talk much about it

591
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,560
 now but that's definitely going to get third for me and then Dredge and Baldur's Gate will be

592
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:21,320
 very up the rear I like Dredge a lot but it's like there are a lot of good games in this category so

593
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,160
 yeah it's very good it's very good category this year it's quite nice having such a lot of interesting

594
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:32,040
 things to have and it's not there's not an obvious thing where I go oh it is a tragedy that this game

595
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,600
 from 2023 didn't get on the ballot because I don't feel that's the case fun fact based on

596
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,200
 last week's stuff I have now watched Godzilla - 1 because it turned out I did have Netflix after

597
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:48,360
 all I think I might have said on the pod I don't have Netflix but I do what is my life like and

598
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:56,440
 Godzilla - 1 which I think YouTube both said last time was good Godzilla - 1 is shockingly good for

599
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,360
 a monster movie it's very good it's it's got loads of things I like to hold lot shouldn't be

600
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:09,720
 shockingly good we both told you it was good yeah but I kind of you like Marvel movies right yes okay

601
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:17,640
 it's shocking if you're a snob I will give you that is that helpful oh 100 but well also it's it's

602
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,240
 Alison did laugh Alison did laugh for that listeners it's just quite funny anyway Liz do you

603
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:31,000
 want to do a pic yeah so I don't really have a pic so John has been suggesting that since

604
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,080
 he has picked Alan Wake AW and Alice has picked Animal Well AW I should pick something with initials

605
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:44,680
 AW but instead I'm going to pick something with initials WA whoa I'm basically going to plug

606
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:50,280
 something that I've plugged elsewhere but having just checked I have not yet plugged on the podcast

607
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:57,480
 basically there is a YouTuber called Will Anderson who is the 2017 North American Scrabble Champion

608
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,440
 and he's got a YouTube channel all about Scrabble and it's great I'm no good at Scrabble I don't

609
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:08,040
 play Scrabble and yet I will like go to his channel every time he posts a new video to look at some

610
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,440
 awesome Scrabble playing I recommend Will Anderson Scrabble channel that I sound like the source

611
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,960
 of YouTuber I like I mean I think if you like cracking the cryptic you'll probably like the Scrabble

612
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,800
 YouTube well I'm hoping that cracking the cryptic play Animal well actually I mean I'm sure they

613
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,360
 will at some point might be a bit un-puzzle-like for them I do have problems when they play video

614
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,760
 games because they end up like shouting at the screen I mean when they're doing a Sudoku I'm not

615
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,280
 pointing out things they're missing but when they're playing video games I'm like no go and do this

616
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,840
 instead don't push that yeah oh I do that when they're doing Sudoku because they do often one of

617
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,600
 the things that's so good about the channel is that they're absolutely brilliant at Sudoku but

618
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:50,040
 obviously they'll sometimes miss something that you have spotted and you'll be like 29 minutes later

619
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,600
 they'll finally make that collection you go you'd have found this puzzle quite a lot easier if you

620
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:02,760
 noticed that you know 25 29 minutes ago do we have anything else on on Scrabble I've never well I

621
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,560
 know that John likes Scrabble but I and I guess I don't I've never liked Scrabble very much because

622
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,480
 I I probably like so many other things I'll probably be fine with Scrabble if I played it with a chess

623
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,320
 clock I mean you do play Scrabble competitive Scrabble they do have a clock and that does

624
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,720
 come into it as you'll find out if you watch the latest video on well Anderson Scrabble YouTube

625
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:27,640
 channel at time of recording anyway cool back but but lots of people don't like chess clocks in

626
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:32,680
 in casual games because they're kind of like obit makes the game so much more pressurized but I

627
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,320
 kind of I would much rather have the game have that little bit of pressure caused by a timer

628
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,440
 than the very large amount of pressure caused by somebody taking 25 minutes about a move especially

629
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,240
 it's me I think Scrabble is also worse and I believe I believe this is a house rule that

630
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,480
 Alison plays with but a lot of people play with a house rule where you can look up words in between

631
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:57,000
 your goats and Scrabble is infinitely worse if you are allowed to do that Scrabble is great when

632
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,400
 you have a word on your rack which you are 95% sure is a word and will win you 50 points and you have

633
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:09,160
 to work out whether the 5% chance that you're going to lose your turn is worth the reward and then

634
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:14,680
 it becomes a push your luck game and an area control game and that is where it sings for me

635
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:20,040
 but a lot of people do not do that and I think that is I know takes away a lot of the crunch

636
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,800
 from my perspective the other thing is if someone plays a word which you are 95% sure is not a word

637
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,440
 and you challenge them then that also goes bad for you and then the game lives in those percentages

638
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:35,960
 and those percentages are something I love in gaming so yeah I like that push your luck aspect

639
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:41,880
 almost to Scrabble that was the old podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

640
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,360
 and it's goodbye from me

641
00:50:47,080 --> 00:51:02,920
 [Music]

642
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:10,280
 Do you know do you know where our listeners come from John? 40 42% of our listeners come from the

643
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,400
 United States and 37% come from the United Kingdom okay five five and a half percent from

644
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:24,760
 Australia 3.15% from Jersey so hello to our two Jersey listeners and so on and so forth

645
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:33,640
 and presumably one from Thailand yes well no well I don't know 0.33% of our listeners come from

646
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:40,280
 Thailand but I should think Liz does not download the episode once it is out I do not download the

647
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:46,600
 episode once it is out because I've already listened to it spoilers listeners I listed before you

648
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,720
 no but I did I think I have gone and I have gone and downloaded some in order to correct our

649
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,840
 transcripts for Hugo purposes so that is almost certainly me and not anyone else gonna say I have

650
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:02,920
 downloaded downloaded a few from time to time that's fair do you want to guess where our largest

651
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:10,520
 non primarily English speaking country is so for the purposes of this I'm I am deciding the

652
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,120
 United States United Kingdom Australia Canada Jersey and New Zealand and Ireland are primarily

653
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:21,960
 English speaking countries I do not intend to erase any of the other languages spoken in those

654
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:28,920
 territories but where is the where is the highest country that is not one of those Poland not Poland
