1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
 Right, let's give it go otherwise I might have to go and get the Alan Key.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:21,120
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 114th episode of Octa Thorpe podcast for Science Fiction

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,360
 and Science Fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 18th of July 2024. I'm John Coxon.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,600
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. We have some letters of comment and Liz is going to take the

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,320
 first one. We have a letter of comment from Christopher J Garcia so he confirms that he will

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,240
 be watching Godzilla in release order adding an important non-canon pieces like Bambi vs Godzilla

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,600
 and SNL skits which is a level of dedication I had not expected. Yep he also thinks Saint

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,920
 of Bright Doors will be second for the Hugo right we're gonna make a note to come back to that in

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,960
 after what? He thinks it will come second for the Hugo behind something Chris tell us what will

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,760
 win the Hugo in fact if you'd like send us your Hugo predictions for everything then we will check

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,400
 back in on them on like whenever our post will con episode is. Yep. And also he was in LA during

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:23,040
 the 1984 Olympics and he got to hold the torch. Fucking love you Chris. I mean how how did you get

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,080
 to hold the torch? I didn't get to hold an Olympic torch but I got to hold a Paralympic torch because

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,600
 that's one of the photo opportunities that they give you at the Olympics. Oh I got to stand near

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,280
 the torch. I mean it's not there was not only one torch in 2012 and I don't suppose there was only

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,480
 one torch in Los Angeles either and they have a lot of torches. Olympic secrets. We all know this

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,080
 because of Doctor Who. I know lots of stuff about the 2012 Olympics because fun fact it was sufficiently

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,000
 close to my house that I could hear the fireworks through my window as they come on the tally a

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,800
 little bit later and it was quite quite wild. Nice. I didn't know what was that Doctor Who episode.

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,680
 I guess it was during my phase of not watching Doctor Who. Well you remember when Russell T. Davis

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,240
 was in charge and it was all a bit nonsense. Yeah I was still watching that. Was the Olympic torch in

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,800
 it? Yeah David Tennant's Doctor did the like the like the brazier I think in what episode?

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,760
 I don't think I've dreamed this. Listeners right in. No but I think I've blanked out of my

24
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,840
 memory for like safety. I can only keep so many things in there now. I'm trying to get rid of

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,520
 some of them and if I got rid of that one I'm quite pleased. You say nonsense. I do. Going back in

26
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,240
 time and then making history work the way it's supposed to is a something that Doctor Who has

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,360
 been doing since its earliest days. Yeah but the bit where a paving slab gives a amount of blow job

28
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,440
 that was pre-nonsense though. Yeah okay. So I talked about collecting convention badges by accident

29
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,480
 last week and we had a couple of walks. Collect wrote to say that she and Alan made all of the

30
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,160
 badges for Discworld Con and Bristol Con and would I like them? And the answer is yes but

31
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:07,200
 and I sent you an email about when. For a Mendelssohn wrote to say I'm sure the Sartre's

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,280
 fiction foundation collection in Liverpool would love the convention badge collection.

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,600
 I will write to them at some point and say would you like a box full of moldy badges

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,840
 and see what they say. I put a pickup in last episode about Tor recusing themselves

35
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,720
 from the Locust Award and I said it was a classy move and Edward Morland wrote to say

36
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,040
 that he thinks if you've won 37 times in a row then it might be a bit late to call recusing

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,760
 yourself a classy move and all I can advise Tor to do is try not to win any awards on the way

38
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,080
 back to the parking lot. Yes so after we discussed the Locust Awards last time and Don does a little

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,640
 drop-in on this we actually looked at what was said about the Best Publish Award in Locust.

40
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,880
 Debbie Pillai in her speech accepting Best Publisha has withdrawn Tor and also Tor.com

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,120
 from consideration for a few years to allow others to shine which I think is I think it's

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,800
 still a classy act because it may be the 37th they've won but you know there's been a different

43
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,080
 string of managing editors for Tor and Tor.com so it's not like this is one person winning

44
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,520
 and so I think it's quite nice that when Debbie Pillai obviously had the power to do this

45
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,000
 she decided it was time to take a back seat and for someone else's whip so we look forward to

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,440
 seeing who is on the list next year. Recusing yourself has become more popular in recent years

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,120
 so that they may have thought it was time and I don't think Tor.com has won anything like 37 times

48
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,280
 so you know I think recusing them as well they are separate publishers although they have

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,720
 the part of the same publishing group but then a lot of things are the part of the same publishing

50
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,080
 group publishing is a bit like that. It's also a bit tricky because you know Tor and Tor.com

51
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,760
 I wonder if there are people who read Tor stuff and Tor.com stuff and just think it's all Tor.

52
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,040
 No I'm sure there are lots of people who think that but it's definitely not.

53
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,560
 I think Tor UK is still totally separate and therefore would still be eligible.

54
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,160
 I may be wrong. I feel like it's separate in the same way which is just a separate publisher

55
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,120
 managed by the same overall massive publishing conglomerate but you know if you're part of a

56
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,040
 massive publishing conglomerate please write it and explain your corporate structure to us.

57
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,720
 The thing is there's like a massive publishing conglomerate right like there's Halt's Brink which

58
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,840
 is a massive publishing conglomerate of which Magmillan is a sub bit of which Tor is a sub bit

59
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,560
 of that and what I don't know is whether Tor UK and Tor US sit under the same sub bit called Tor

60
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,360
 Publishing. It's very complicated. All right whoever knows this write in and tell us.

61
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,520
 Somebody who's listening to the podcast knows this I am 99% sure.

62
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,040
 I know it. Tor UK isn't in the Tor Publishing group because if you go to Tor Publishing Group.com

63
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,040
 they have a list of the things that are in it and Tor UK is not on the list.

64
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,360
 Research. It's Tor Bramble, Forge Nightfire, Torteen Starscape and Tor.com.

65
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,800
 So it's kind of slightly further removed but it is still all part of I guess McMillan?

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,840
 Yes which is all part of Halt's Brink. I do think it is fair to say that if Tor had

67
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,520
 recused themselves and then Tor.com had won 25 times we might plausibly have argued that that

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,960
 was not quite what we meant when we asked them to recuse so I think in general this is probably

69
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,960
 the right way to do it if you're going to. So next year everyone vote Tor UK in the locus

70
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,840
 publishing award because I think that would be very very funny. Oh Edward does also say

71
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,920
 if there's nothing else on locus expecting individuals or individual organisations to

72
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,000
 recuse themselves in order to fix the awarding organisation or the voting base is complete lack

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,720
 of interest in the breadth of the field. Feels like putting a sticking plaster over a gaping wound.

74
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,280
 It's tricky in it. I don't think I want the Hugo to forcibly recuse people

75
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,320
 and I don't think it's unreasonable that people tend to vote for the things they know

76
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,200
 and that most people don't have a massive breadth of field which they can call on especially when

77
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,600
 it comes to stuff like Publisher. But yeah I don't know. What do you guys think about that?

78
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,040
 It's tricky because when would you recuse someone because you know you win a few times in a row

79
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,280
 all right and then at some point you're like oh maybe I should recuse but then you know we've

80
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,400
 talked about recusing before like there's a point in which it is kind of awkward you're sort of

81
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,600
 recusing yourself because you're saying well uh you know everyone else who wins after us is only

82
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,040
 winning because we recused ourselves. So I think it's a tricky balance. I don't think I think it's

83
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,360
 working okay in that people are recusing themselves after multiple wins and that's probably how it

84
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,400
 should work. Maybe up to thought pointing it out helped because we are so influential. Yeah I'm

85
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,760
 an influencer. If anyone from Tor is listening right in yeah I think the thing is right that like

86
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,840
 obviously if you codified it in the so phrases if you do it with the Hugo you need to codify it in

87
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,560
 the Wussfuss constitution and that would make it very awkward because we all know it when we see

88
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,920
 it I mean it's much easier if people recuse when it becomes taking the piss and that's what

89
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,680
 annoys me so much when people don't recuse when it's taking the piss because I don't think it's

90
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,600
 easy to codify it's much easier to do it if you're the one that won but maybe I'm wrong I don't know

91
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,680
 what other people think listeners right in. When we were discussing it last episode we weren't

92
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,040
 necessarily saying Tor should recuse themselves we were also saying to voters if you have voted for

93
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:25,840
 Tor 12 times in a row is this because you genuinely have read lots of different books and you think

94
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,800
 Tor put out all the best ones or is it because you're still remembering oh Tor put out some good

95
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,440
 stuff I've already for them last time I'll put them at the top again and just like be aware of

96
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,840
 what you are reading. We also heard from Mike Scott who says yes I did indeed find the cerebus

97
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,320
 reviews that I was talking about but he also notes that Andrew Willstone did a very insightful

98
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,680
 review of the entire run a few years ago which he did and we will link to that in the show notes

99
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,800
 this is quite a lot of thoughtful discussion of cerebus I don't know what triggered all this kind

100
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,160
 of reevaluation of it but it does seem if you want to read it then there is a lot of discussion of

101
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,800
 basically whether you should start and when you should stop. I nearly I was reading Andrew Willstone's

102
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,480
 review and I realized that I had not said something about cerebus last time which is that it's it's

103
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,520
 hard to overstate how influential it was and how important it was until it went completely off

104
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,960
 the rails it's and I think it's the first example of my lifetime of the victor a lot of Victorian

105
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:31,600
 novels that we think of as great were serialized and I think cerebus gives the sense of what it

106
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,080
 must have been like as those were coming in because you know it was just people were talking about

107
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,600
 at the time and it was wildly influential and it just became weirder and weirder and weirder and

108
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,560
 it is quite a lot like um real dimensions just from Shandy in his review and I I think it is quite

109
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,440
 like just Shandy in that way of course cerebus does go off on and tangents quite a lot like all

110
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:02,640
 of the time and I have not read all of it Raj wrote in on mastodon and said when we talked about

111
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,640
 Rebecca's World on a previous episode quite a long time ago now he had loved it as a kid much like

112
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:17,840
 I did and has set a price alert for it I guess on eBay and has now bought a reasonably priced copy

113
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,440
 and so thanks us for getting him to reread it so you are welcome Raj I saw that you gave it four

114
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,880
 out five on Goodreads so I'm glad it held up so hurrah and if you're interested in that listeners

115
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,680
 and you haven't been listening since the beginning the episode I was on of alleybaker brooks' podcast

116
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,320
 fantasy book swap I picked Rebecca's World and we discussed it so if you're interested in my

117
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,600
 thoughts you can go and listen to that I'll put a link in the show notes and Alison was also

118
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,400
 all fantasy book swaps well put that in as well why not I picked Marianne Dreams by Catherine

119
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:55,520
 Store the book I named my daughter after and a lovely segue is that Ali left us a comment on

120
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,320
 Facebook Ali is our occasional children's and young adult literature correspondent

121
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,200
 saying that the sequel to this rather delightful quest novel should be eligible for award nominations

122
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,280
 and it's called Vivi Conway and the Sword of Legend by Lizzie Huxley Jones thank you very

123
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:20,560
 much Ali Duncan McGregor says he went for a walk good on you Duncan Bridget Badger says that super

124
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,480
 art referring to our episode art last time which is quite super if you haven't seen it because it's

125
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,680
 very small in the show notes you can click through to octothorp.podbean.com and see the full size one

126
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,360
 and it is a good one last time I said to Alison Alison Alison please can you draw like Godzilla

127
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,880
 smashing the octa-thop logo and she has drawn Godzilla smashing the octa-thop logo and now I'll

128
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:56,560
 be demanding ever more elaborate show art. We're going to talk about the things that we're picking

129
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,360
 for the Hugo Awards that are not best novel because we went through our best novel picks in episode

130
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,760
 111 and we also will be skipping over best game or interactive work and if you want to hear our

131
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,840
 thoughts on that you can listen to episodes 104 we talked about chance of sinaa 109 we talked about

132
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:23,520
 dredge 112 we talked about Baldur's Gate 3 113 we talked about Alan Wake 2 and I will be picking

133
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,800
 Jedi survivor later this episode. I'm talking about Zelda and you'll have to listen to the other

134
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,600
 episodes to find out why we'll start with novella yes novella who wants to introduce novella I have

135
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,200
 read five of the six novellas I should say it's it's gonna look like I've read an extremely

136
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,240
 haphazard selection of stuff and this is basically because I loaded all the stuff up on my kindle into

137
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,840
 a very random order so it's because you've read an incredibly haphazard selection of stuff listen

138
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,120
 I'm wondering about whether I should recuse myself for the rest of this episode because of how little

139
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,920
 of the Hugo stuff I've read I will ask clever questions about it maybe it's fine it'll just be

140
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,200
 an episode with lots of me so I have read five of the six I have not read life does not allow us to

141
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,640
 meet by hee-hee but I have read all the rest they're all pretty good I don't think there's any

142
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,600
 duff ones I just think there's kind of five novellas that I all think are not quite

143
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,120
 amazing don't want to be read I have read all six Liz oh hey my main

144
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:34,720
 thought is that I don't like Alex Woodens translations and I don't know whether the underlying stories

145
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,200
 would have been better translated by someone else for me but certainly life does not allow us

146
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,520
 to meet I detested see to Mercury I thought was a really interesting conceit but I thought it was

147
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,480
 clumsily written and I assume that is in the translation and not in the original Chinese but

148
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,680
 I might be wrong I loved Rose House by Arcadimartin which is probably not a surprise because I love

149
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,240
 everything Arcadimartin right but I thought it was really creepy in a really nice way

150
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,320
 Malath's the gates was pretty good Thornhead's Ditto and the mimicking of known successes

151
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,680
 I remember enjoying but can't remember anything about what was that one about does anyone remember

152
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,280
 I read this category first yeah so that's the one where basically humanity has left

153
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,080
 earth to do climate change and gone to live on these sort of orbital platforms and there's a

154
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,880
 detective investigating the death of a man who appears to have just stepped off one of the platforms

155
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,840
 oh I do remember that yes yeah you meant that one yet it's because the title has nothing at all to

156
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:41,440
 do with the story it does though it does yes no I did enjoy that but in a very it was all very

157
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,560
 competently done but there was nothing completely outstanding in any of the books on this I think

158
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,160
 the only one that kind of thrilled me was Rose House so I think I probably agree with you basically

159
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,560
 yeah so it's I think one thing that's interesting is all the Chinese nominees that were previously

160
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,840
 untranslated have been translated by Alex Woodend so I've not seen it mentioned anymore but my

161
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,520
 assumption is that Glasgow arranged some translations it could be totally wrong on that so yeah it's

162
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,400
 very hard for me to say whether I am put off because of the translation or because of the underlying

163
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,640
 story we have no particular expertise here I also quite enjoyed seeds of mercury but there were

164
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,760
 certain things that just didn't quite make sense like the main character essentially inherits

165
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,400
 after his aunt dies she had like this groundbreaking idea essentially for new life and the main narrator

166
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,440
 ends up inheriting that and I couldn't quite work out why that was necessary it's one of those

167
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,160
 things where if you take that out and just had that aunt there running out of money and then

168
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,920
 trying to get the funding for it the story would have worked I think just as well would that have

169
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,960
 required a female protagonist oh yes it would but why wasn't it an uncle I mean you know no that

170
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:59,200
 but that is true it basically has this kind of pioneering female scientist who is entirely like

171
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,840
 offstage because she dies at the start of the develop but I did enjoy that I enjoyed them all

172
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,960
 I thought mamas at the gate and Thorn hedge so mamas at gate buying Nivo and Thorn hedge by

173
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:15,040
 Tking Fisher both suffered a bit because they are very much in the mode of what I know Nivo and

174
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,800
 Tking Fisher right which is that Thorn hedge is like a sort of fairy tale retelling of Sleeping Beauty

175
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,880
 and mamas at the gates is another in the long-running series of singing hills novellas that's one

176
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,040
 and so they're both good installments in that but didn't give me anything new the mimicking of

177
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,800
 known successes I really like the setting and found it an extremely slow mystery and Rose House I

178
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
 just I don't think I quite gelled I really like the idea and everything it just didn't come together

179
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,000
 so it's going to be a very tricky category for me to vote in because I really don't know which

180
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,440
 one to put first as of listening to this I will have two days to do that so I've hopefully thought

181
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,720
 about it a bit by then when Liz says she enjoyed all of them it's vital that we reiterate she didn't

182
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,720
 read like it does not allow us to meet yes sorry I did not which it's a gender not like and so John

183
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,840
 is now like he's like if you like that we're not friends anymore twisting the knife I was not the

184
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,960
 only one who really detested this novella at the moment how would you rank them Liz if I forced

185
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:20,640
 you to if you forced me to it's probably mammoth at the gate Thorn hedge Rose House mimicking of

186
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,120
 known successes seeds of mercury but then as I get further through that I'm like am I really

187
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,440
 going to put that on fifth it's hard that's tricky isn't it because I think my list Rose

188
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,760
 house goes at the top I think for me mimicking of known successes goes at the bottom because

189
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,120
 although I really enjoyed it I don't think it's it's just it's a nice detective story and then

190
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,480
 probably Thorn hedge above mammoths of the gate and I really don't know where seeds of mercury

191
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,960
 is going because I did not like the writing but I thought some of the ideas were interesting

192
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,800
 and I don't know how to slot it in amongst the others it's definitely not going first but I could

193
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,880
 see on the day me putting it second or fourth so there's quite a lot of variance there

194
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:12,400
 novelette I've read one of the novelets I read three okay which ones of you read Liz

195
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,120
 I'm really sorry I read introduction to 21 81 over to your second edition by Gucci translated

196
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,720
 by Emily Jin one man's treasure by Sarah Pinska and the year without sunshine by Naomi Quitson

197
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:34,640
 hey I read I am I was it I am I am AI or is that the trick well it's I am yeah it's about a woman

198
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,720
 I am assuming it's pronounced I is it it could be a I'm so sorry I don't know but basically it's

199
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,720
 about a woman called I who runs a company called I am AI what did you think of the ones you read

200
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,520
 so it's actually well since I read two of these because I read them pre-nomination because they

201
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,400
 were ones that were highly rated and so I was reading them to see if I wanted to nominate them

202
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
 so finally I did not nominate either of them because they're quite good but they're just maybe

203
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,280
 not my type of thing woman's treasure by Sarah Pinska is basically about garbage men and finding

204
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,640
 magical objects and it's pretty good but it didn't kind of stick with me and the year without

205
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,720
 sunshine by Naomi Quitson I think I talked about last week it's the one about kind of

206
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,840
 communities banding together in a post-apocalyptic well not really post-apocalyptic but

207
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,680
 something has occurred and communities are banding together and it's about neighbors and I think

208
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,880
 a fairly reasonable story about how they they might come together it just didn't have a lot

209
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,080
 else for me an introduction to 2181 over to your second edition is very interesting I enjoyed

210
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,080
 this one so it's about kind of essentially a world in which we have figured out cryo sleep

211
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,000
 and it reminded me a little bit of almost Ted Chiang who does you know he does like

212
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,760
 wrote "Liking What You See" which is like what if we have this technology let's explore loads of

213
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,080
 aspects of it and it's a little bit similar to that I just found that the key thing in 2181

214
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,200
 over to is kind of it's supposed to be the introduction to a book there's kind of lots of

215
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,440
 characters who are talked about in this and that you're supposed to kind of find how it all comes

216
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,840
 together at the end and I think I had not got strong enough impression of the different people

217
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,760
 and how it all fit together at the end but there is a lot of interesting stuff about what would

218
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,240
 happen if you could actually put yourself into cryo sleep and wake up in the future yeah I think

219
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,840
 at the moment that's probably top of my ballot but I do have another three to read and I have

220
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,400
 heard good stuff about I am I. I have just realized I have indeed I have actually read Warman's Treasure

221
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,160
 by Sarah Pinsker and I did quite enjoy it it was before I cancelled my uncanny subscription

222
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:54,320
 and I thought I at the time really enjoyed it I am I I thought was good I don't know I obviously

223
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,400
 I've not read any others except for Warman's Treasure at the moment it's going below Warman's Treasure

224
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,960
 for me yeah so I will just say here that I have realized that I read Give Me English by I.J.ang

225
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,880
 because it was on my Kindle from the Vote Packet and I thought it was a best short story not many

226
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,960
 but it's not it's just in there for the Astounding Award eligibility I think but that was also quite

227
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,920
 interesting interesting I sure that is obviously I'm going to read I'm going to read that at some

228
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,240
 point I haven't got to eat it it's one of those ways like it's got a science fictional premise I

229
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,760
 don't think the world building quite works but the premise is interesting enough that I didn't care

230
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,760
 how many short stories have we read four I've read all of them I think tasting the future delicacy

231
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,760
 three time is the one which actually has some it leaves some things untranslated and puts it in

232
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,640
 a footnote which I like when if there's not an obvious translation and so you can either go for

233
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,680
 something that doesn't quite fit or you can leave it untranslated and put a footnote in to say here

234
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,640
 is the concept that you need to know and I've left it untranslated because you can't put a single

235
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:06,240
 word in I prefer that way I think than to doing it as a straightforward not quite accurate translation

236
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,080
 even if it does break up the flow a bit because you have to read an extra footnote so I think it's

237
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
 a balance you don't want to do it in every sentence because you're going to spend your whole life

238
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,320
 reading footnotes but I kind of like it as an occasional look I cannot translate this perfectly

239
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,240
 you should know that this is the word that was used and that it has all these different meanings

240
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,840
 for people who can read it in their original language yeah I did enjoy the tasting the future

241
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:36,240
 delicacy three time story so hurrah it's translated by jwetting si nie the author talks about the

242
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,280
 translation choices made at the start of the story which is really interesting the part of the reason

243
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,960
 I think what I'm bouncing off is Alex Wooden's translation and not the underlying text is that

244
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,640
 the you're I'm going to read the author's note verbatim in Chinese I purposely used the title

245
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,760
 insert string of Chinese here to express manifold meanings such as taste delicacies three times

246
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,560
 three kinds of delicacies and three sections of an article about delicacies it is extremely

247
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,400
 difficult to keep the manifold meanings in translation the English translation of the story

248
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,200
 translated the title is three gourmet delicacies different from the previous offered translation

249
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,080
 so the version in the pack has a different title to the title on the best short story roster

250
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,560
 because the version of the pack is titled three gourmet delicacies that I really think underlines

251
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,640
 how much control you have over the English you use when you're translating Chinese and the fact

252
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,640
 that this translation I found much more compelling than the wooden translations I think is also

253
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,680
 telling so that's a brief digression at the beginning on on the Chinese translations in the

254
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,640
 packet it makes me really wish I read Chinese I feel I want to say at this point if you're Alex

255
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,080
 Woodend write in Alex is a very well respected translator of Chinese science fiction and

256
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,400
 I mean I know this is hard but I do I do feel everything you're saying about overly literal

257
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,960
 and therefore clunky translations really often getting in the way of stories quite a lot

258
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,960
 especially for Chinese science fiction but actually other science fiction in translation it's not

259
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,160
 you other other SF authors have been bedeviled by having translators who did not let the story

260
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,520
 sing as much as it might have done I know this is an incredibly hard topic though I'm just going

261
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,800
 to put into the show notes because we recognize this is a topic that you know we are pretty badly

262
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:34,240
 equipped to discuss there's like an essay by Ken Liu about translation and also a piece by

263
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,080
 someone who reads Chinese and English looking at some of their translations and discussing how

264
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,560
 they feel about them and will pop those in the show notes for further reading which which other

265
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:51,040
 ones did I read I read better living through algorithms which I mentioned briefly last week

266
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,800
 that's the Naomi Quitsa story which is very much in the vein of the other Naomi Quitsa stories

267
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 I read How to Raise a Crockling in Your Bathtub by P. Jelly Club which I liked enough to put it on

268
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:05,920
 my ballot and I read The Sound of Children Screening by Rachel K. Jones and what was the fourth

269
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,480
 old future delicacy? And future delicacy three times yeah so what do you think of them Liz?

270
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,760
 I'm trying to think what's so about them if you have something to say then you should you should

271
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,760
 go ahead and do it and I'll just argue with you that's more fun. Hey better living through

272
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:25,520
 algorithms is I really liked it I like Naomi Quitsa any way I thought it was fascinating

273
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,360
 as a concept and it reminded me a lot of the stuff she's done in her catnet YA novels which

274
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,400
 have been in the load style category previously it kind of feels to me like she wanted to look

275
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,600
 at the same basic concept but in an adult short story rather than in a YA novel so I like that

276
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,440
 a lot. How to raise a crackling in your bathtub I thought was great I really enjoyed it

277
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,480
 I thought it was just I liked the ending a lot and The Mausoleum's Children I thought was okay

278
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:00,880
 and The Sound of Children Screening I liked a lot and tasting the future delicacy three times

279
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,280
 maybe really laugh at the end. I very much liked how that came together. An Anselis journey

280
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,280
 I thought was fine I'm not sure I thought the concept was up to much so I'm not sure whether

281
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,760
 I would have liked it more with a different translator or not because eh but yeah Liz promised

282
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,320
 to argue with me. I did but there's not a lot to argue with. Am I just very sensible and right

283
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:36,000
 about everything? Everything no but possibly a short story. I can agree with you yeah um I think

284
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,400
 I probably like tasting the future delicacy three times a bit more than you did because I think

285
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,400
 that might actually be top of my ballot. But I also like The Sound of Children Screening I think it's

286
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,680
 it's essentially kind of fantasy horror fiction that plays with the idea of Portal fantasy

287
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,680
 while also writing about school shootings which is a very tricky thing to do and I think it does

288
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:04,400
 a really good job. I also think it landed the ending I liked the ending I thought it ended where

289
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,200
 it needed to and the ending made sense which is not always true in that kind of short story.

290
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,000
 I think yeah Sound of Children Screening is probably top of my ballot and then probably

291
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,200
 Kraken and then probably algorithms and then probably tasting the future delicacy and then

292
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,840
 probably Moseleym's children and then probably Anselis journey that would be probably my ranking.

293
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,160
 I've used the word probably about 15 times there probably you probably have Liz taste maker

294
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,880
 Batty do you want us take us through the best series finalists? Yes so there are six finalists

295
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,320
 the final architecture by Adrian Tchaikovsky Imperial Radge by Anne Lecky the last binding by

296
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,400
 frame ask the laundry files by Charles Doss October day by Sean and Maguire and the universe of Zuyar

297
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,840
 by Aliette de Baudat and I have read some or all of five of those. Is the one you haven't read any

298
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,720
 of the last binding by frame ask? No. Oh which one is it October day? I know it's been nominated

299
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,280
 for series like four times and I've still never got around to meeting any of them. So I have I have

300
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:15,760
 read this is basically there are three things here where I've read either all or part of one novel

301
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,120
 and decided that the series is not really for me. There is one that everyone says is excellent

302
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,760
 and I'm saving it for sometime when I need something fantastic to write and read it. There's one that

303
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,320
 I've read all of I think is very good indeed and one that I've never actually heard of.

304
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,760
 And weirdly the one you've not heard of is The Laundry Files by Charlie Stross.

305
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,800
 It is not The Laundry Files by Charlie Stross but the laundry files by Charlie Stross is probably

306
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:44,960
 not the series for me and neither is October day and neither is the universe of Zuyar and I have not

307
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,840
 read the final architecture because honestly there's so much Adrian Tchaikovsky I mean I don't think

308
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,040
 I've read the final architecture which series is this? This is the big space opera one with the

309
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:02,160
 kind of race of crab alien crime lords. Tell me which the books are. No Google fine.

310
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,920
 Shards of Earth yes shards of earth haven't read it.

311
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,160
 I think it's going at the top of my ballot. I'm about to say something that might upset people

312
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,560
 but The Laundry Files would have gone at the top of my ballot in the days when there were only five

313
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:22,800
 books in that series but more recent books I'm like no it does not. I liked it when it was still

314
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,320
 it and it doesn't feel like it anymore to me. Maybe that's unfair but that is my opinion.

315
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,960
 It feels a bit diminishing returnsy like I loved the first few but the first few are the ones that

316
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:40,080
 we gave Hugo's two in like 2005 or something and it has not kept me entertained for 20 years.

317
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,600
 Yeah I think I would agree with that.

318
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,400
 So I think the Anlecchi is fabulous under the I can't imagine why it hasn't won best series

319
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,240
 before but presumably because the first three books were before we did invented best series

320
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,040
 and it's certainly going to win and it's going to be top of my ballot.

321
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:01,920
 I hope it doesn't win because it has already won Hugo Awards and Adrian Jiekowski has not

322
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,240
 so I hope he wins. But I haven't actually read the here Adrian Jiekowski so I would feel

323
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,320
 slightly bad about saying it's top of my ballot when I haven't actually read it.

324
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,640
 And I haven't heard of the frame mask but this has read some so could you tell us a bit about

325
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,520
 the last bundle by frame mask?

326
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,880
 I have read the first one which is a marvelous light which I actually read I think when it was

327
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,120
 in a previous Hugo packet. I was just going trying to work out when I was discussing it.

328
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,160
 It's the first one which is rather like is definitely sort of romance with magic.

329
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,000
 So it's about a young man who thinks he's got a little posting government and it turns out he

330
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,040
 is like liaison to Secret Magical Society and he gets thrown together with someone from the

331
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:50,000
 Magical Society and they have a romance. It had quite a lot of sex scenes.

332
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,280
 I was looking up what I wrote about it and one of the things I wrote was I had to stop reading

333
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,760
 this on the train because I was worried someone would look over my shoulder and see I was reading

334
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,640
 a big sex scene. It's a teeny bit Harry pottery because there's a Secret Magical Society and I

335
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,040
 know Harry pottery is not actually set in Edwardian England but it feels like the Magical Society is

336
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,680
 100 years behind or whatever so you get that feel a little bit. I quite enjoyed it. I have not yet

337
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,400
 read the other two which are in the voter back so I will be getting round to them but you know I

338
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,040
 thought first one was pretty good. Not going to be top of my ballot because I'm pretty sure that is

339
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:32,160
 Adrian Charkoski. But it might be third. Is it romanticy? Yes. But I think of romanticy as being

340
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:40,000
 more sort of like fantasy that is not set in our world which has romance in. But I guess you probably

341
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,600
 I don't know that's just maybe my definition of romancy which is not everyone else's definition

342
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,240
 of romancy. I say you could pick this one. I think the romance aspect is stronger than the

343
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,920
 fantasy aspect if that makes sense. Like I've read fancy novels where there is some romance

344
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,760
 I would just ask this as a romance novel where there is some fantasy. One reason I'm not putting

345
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,960
 the end lecky top is because as we previously discussed I did not like the fourth Imperial

346
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,200
 Raj book as much as you two did and I feel like the first ones have already been pretty well

347
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,000
 rewarded. So that is not a rational way to look at it. I'm not you know thinking of them as a series.

348
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,440
 As a series I think it's very close to Tchaikovsky and possibly ahead but I also think it has had

349
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,560
 awards love elsewhere and I think final architecture needs more awards love.

350
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:30,720
 Yeah I think I agree with that. It's worth noting that translation state is the fifth novel

351
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,160
 in the Imperial Raj universe. There was also provenance which I remember nothing about

352
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:42,160
 and which I thought I think seemed to remember thinking was fine at the time but I was not blown

353
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,120
 away by. Could I completely forgotten that was in the same universe but again I have read it and

354
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,600
 completely forgotten about it but it's very that one is much more like lightly connected

355
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,600
 than the latest one I think. So the reason I would say I'm not going to put an lecky at the top of

356
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,640
 this category is because I think she is better at writing standalone novels than she is series

357
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,920
 by which I mean I think and celery justice and translation state are both very very good.

358
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,920
 I mean the other three books in this series are okay whereas I think if you read the Tchaikovsky

359
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,480
 trilogy I think I mean I've only read the first two but certainly unless he massively fluffs the

360
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,520
 ending and unless he's been very untchaikovsky like and had a wibbling quality the thing I think

361
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:31,440
 Tchaikovsky is very good at is delivering consistent high quality works without fail and lecky seems

362
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,240
 much more bumpy and I think a series should not be as bumpy as lecky's writing is.

363
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,120
 You're making it sound like I should get the Tchaikovsky read before the deadline so that I can vote for it.

364
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,960
 I think you should read it all about the deadline. Yeah I might manage one.

365
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,600
 I mean there's just like three 800 page books it's not much.

366
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,120
 Well but I know it's just like three 800 page books but I'm gonna say I prefer this to somebody who

367
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,120
 writes like 17 novels in a series because I find it very hard to believe that 17 novels series are

368
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,800
 gonna hold the quality and also actually be doing different exciting things with every book.

369
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,520
 Yeah so I think one of the things I like about the final architecture is it is three enormous scale

370
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,000
 galactic space operas that are very heavily serialised and yet when I reach the end of it

371
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,760
 the main to the main character Idris Telemia Telemia basically has a kind of really sort of slightly

372
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,160
 sad and tragic story which manages to pass the wall three and I think ends really well.

373
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,520
 So one of the things I like is when you are having this galactic scale like clash at the end you

374
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,680
 also have this very human story going on that I found really satisfying. I may have had a little cry.

375
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,640
 Hey. And how many space opera books make you do that?

376
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:52,400
 That is a fair point. I think yeah I think for me I suspect the reason I am such a massive

377
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,320
 Tragofsky fan is that he is that he is one of the authors that manages to bridge the massive

378
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,160
 ideas and world building with stories about people and not every author manages to do both of those

379
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,760
 at once. I think one of the massive problems I have with Summer Lecky's books is that they fall

380
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,680
 too far to one end of that spectrum. I actually think Lecky kind of goes both ways and her best

381
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,400
 is in the middle but she doesn't always land in the middle. I just want to pick up you kind of

382
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,840
 like saying Adrian Kuchakoski does the massive ideas in the world building. I love that stuff.

383
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:33,120
 The stuff I don't like is is space adventure where I go. Oh no this is a big old story just

384
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:39,120
 just with spaceships instead of biplanes. And I don't think I've never seen Adrian Kuchakoski do

385
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,800
 that. I mean you know you might do for all I know but not in the things I've read at all.

386
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,360
 So I think I probably am going to like it quite a lot but like just sit down and get on with it.

387
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,280
 You're going to mean him eventually. Just go for it.

388
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:59,280
 What's your ranking going to be? Alison and Liz. So I will try to get some of it read.

389
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,640
 And then otherwise yes I'll be voting for the Lecky. I don't know what I'll do with the rest.

390
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,080
 Haven't read the mask but really then probably I'll be an order. Bode,

391
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,360
 Stros, Maguire. My order will be Tchaikovsky, Lecky, Stros, Devodar, Maguire.

392
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,120
 I don't know where mask is going because I haven't read that one yet. What about you Liz?

393
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,600
 Hi, order is Tchaikovsky, Lecky, Mask, Stros, Devodar, I think.

394
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:30,320
 That's actually the same as my order except you've read Mask and not read Maguire. So maybe I will

395
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,000
 agree with you or mask and we will have the same order. All right I'm useless at the next two categories.

396
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,120
 So I've read, I've read 4.5 Best Graphics Story. So Beowulf, I've not read.

397
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:48,400
 None of my libraries have copies. The version in the Hugo Packet was not the full version

398
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,560
 and I'm reluctant to spend 25 quid on a physical book just to see what it's like. So I've not read

399
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,680
 that one. I have read the others with the exception of the three body problem part one where I read

400
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,440
 the first three pages and thought no and put it down again. Shabek Lebeek, which I probably

401
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:12,160
 massively mispronunciating and sorry to everyone, which was published as your wish is my command

402
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,520
 and that is the version I'm reading. Kindly lent to me by Neil Harrison is amazing so far. I'm like

403
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,880
 a third of the way through but unless something really weird happens it's going top. Sargave

404
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,560
 of all the 11 is the first Sargave comic I've read. It's pretty good. I liked it a lot. That will

405
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,920
 be going second. It makes me want to go back and read other Sargave comics. Wonder Woman Historia made

406
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,800
 me very angry in a good way. Zeus was a prick and I knew that but it really makes you feel it

407
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,960
 and I like that great deal and at the moment I think that's going above Sargave actually and

408
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,000
 then the witches of World War II had an uphill struggle with me because I'm very tired of World

409
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,320
 War II and I'm very tired of British exceptionalism in World War II and also I didn't really like the

410
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,480
 art style or the coloring or the characters so I didn't like it very much. Sorry Paul. Sounds like

411
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,600
 that one is not for John. I like like vivid more impressionistic abstract comic art which Wonder

412
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:19,520
 Woman does fantastically and which is World War II is very literal, very subdued, very mostly

413
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,880
 beige art and I think that's because it's trying to look like World War II and you know that's fair

414
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,520
 but it's not my cup of tea. Anyone else read any comics? Would it just be noted comics expert

415
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,560
 John Coxon? Best related work? I will be voting for all these worlds reviews and essays by Neil

416
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,040
 Harrison. I have also read a city on Mars which is very good but we'll be going below Neil on my

417
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,360
 ballot and I have not yet got to a traveler in time. The critical practice of Maureen Kincaid

418
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:59,200
 speller but I want to without you peeps. I am partway through a traveling time. I have read all these

419
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,440
 worlds reviews and essays which we'd be going top of my ballot. I haven't read the rest. I mean one

420
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,560
 of them is a podcast right or something similar to a podcast. That's a great question. I I'm just

421
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,680
 double checking so I don't think the culture the drawings was in the packet. It's not and I'm not

422
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,520
 going to seek a copy out so it's probable that I'm not going to read that.

423
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,520
 Indeed. The city of Mars was also not in the packet but I had read it already and I don't know

424
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,560
 about the two. I can't see the two other finalists discover X and Chinese science fiction and oral

425
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,240
 history. I assume Chinese science fiction and oral history is an oral thing but...

426
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,160
 So the Discover X interview I think is a sort of interview talk show which appears to be related

427
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:54,320
 to the Chengdu Wilkon. Oh yeah now I remember. It's a professional podcast that is a short feature on

428
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,680
 the Chengdu Wilkon. This is going below no award on my ballot guys because I hate it when a Wilkon

429
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:11,600
 eats itself on the Hugo ballot. That's really interesting because if this is a digression but

430
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:20,080
 where's the line for you? Like if if Meg did a bunch of audio interviews at Glasgow with people

431
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:26,400
 working on Glasgow and then edited them into a project like as an independent and released it

432
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,600
 and it was a fantastic fan historical resource and it got nominated I would think that was completely

433
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:38,080
 legit and so I'm not saying I think this Chengdu project is completely like worthy of a vote

434
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,480
 but I can definitely imagine situations in which you could get a very similar project that I would

435
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,040
 think was amazing. Also Meg I'm not suggesting you do this. Stop planning to do this. Say no to this

436
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:58,880
 idea Meg. Put the audio recorder down Meg. You are correct that it would be possible to do something

437
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,400
 that was heavily Wilkon focused that I would nevertheless think was the right sort of thing to be seeing

438
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,920
 on the ballot but that is not what has traditionally happened when things that are world-conner

439
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,040
 indeed convention focused have happened so no it is theoretically possible but but I don't think

440
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,880
 this is one I think this is a little promo video. No yeah I mean don't get me wrong I'm with you

441
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,920
 on this particular case. I have read quite a lot of the essays in a traveller in time the critical

442
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,760
 practice of Maury Kincaid speller because I've been reading her work for a long time. My vote is

443
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,440
 nevertheless going to all these worlds reviews and essays by Neil Harrison. I am quite excited

444
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,680
 by a city on Mars but I haven't read the whole thing yet I've got a bit and I do like its premise

445
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,360
 very much and John Pickett has previous. I did and I haven't been able to read the culture the drawings

446
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:56,800
 I it would be a bit sad if it won. Yes I think that's fair. I feel it would be people voting for

447
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,480
 something which it is not. Yes. Which is they love Ian and they'd love to give him a hugo. The project

448
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,640
 on the oral history of Chinese science fiction I believe is in the packet and is a text document

449
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,280
 but is not in English and so I have not read it. I think the tables of contents are in English

450
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,760
 but none of the text is and it looks absolutely fascinating but I cannot in any way really evaluate

451
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,600
 it but it is exactly the sort of thing I think should happen it looks like a detailed fan historical

452
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:35,280
 work and it is yeah. Oh I wish they translated this but I mean this is where I go oh I wish

453
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,760
 you translated this or because I will call it stop for the translation of this. Yeah but how long is

454
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,320
 it? Yeah I mean there's no way that Worldcon has this is about 800 pages of combined text

455
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,360
 and so no I think it would have been lovely if it had been translated but it would have been

456
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:59,680
 monetarily and temporally quite un-undertaking. Phanact.org let's let's do some crowd

457
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,120
 funded to get this translated. I have no idea what the going rate is for that for translations

458
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:11,920
 but I suspect translating a 750 word document is a lot of money. Maybe translate the first chapter

459
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,400
 and let's see also a good option and that would be a good option for the hugo pack too now that I

460
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,000
 think of it. I think it will be interesting to see whether that the fact that all these worlds of

461
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,680
 using essays by Neil Harrison is in the voter pack in its entirety and a traveling time by Maureen

462
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,960
 Kingcanspeller is not. I will be interested to see if that seems to have any effect on the voting

463
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,120
 because only the first part of Maureen's book is there and it's I think it's quite a short

464
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:43,520
 excerpt. It doesn't feel like you really fully get into it unless I've dealt a long file or

465
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,720
 something but I think it's just an excerpt isn't it? No I yeah well it says "except" in the

466
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,240
 file name so yes I think you are probably right it has the first... no sorry the forward the

467
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:01,200
 introduction and the first three essays one of which is a screed about Sherlock. It's a start of the

468
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,960
 book and it feels like maybe it would have been more interesting in this case to have part of

469
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,600
 the middle of the book and not have the introduction in there. Certainly if there are only three essays

470
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,360
 by Maureen and one of them is about Sherlock it's difficult to form a view of that as opposed to 450

471
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:22,480
 words of the purest Harrison Gold. Can I make that the title of the episode or would nearly

472
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,520
 himself? I think you might have to run that one. Past him. I could always make the title would nearly

473
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,280
 himself. I think you might have to run that one past him. Right best dramatic presentation long form

474
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,520
 who wants to go through this? Alison you've seen some of these. I have I have not seen

475
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,360
 haven't seen all of them though. God what am I like? Neither have I for reasons to become apparent.

476
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:51,120
 I haven't seen Barbie which I mean I definitely will see Barbie before the voting deadline.

477
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,280
 What have you been doing? I saved it for when Marianne came round and then we didn't watch it so

478
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,480
 you know that's what happened. What I mean is I don't get round to a lot of things. I probably

479
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,240
 should have gone to see Barbie in the cinema I'm not quite sure why I did. Oh I do remember I was

480
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,960
 expecting it to be on my various aeroplays last year and it wasn't I was very pissed off.

481
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:18,160
 No of the ones I see poor things will probably get my vote. What about you guys?

482
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,480
 But now I've seen and now I know that I've got Netflix after all. I can probably see

483
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,680
 Nimono which I believe is on Netflix. Yes. Liz how many of these have you seen? Four.

484
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,920
 Which ones? Barbie Dungeons and Dragons, Nimono and Spiderman. I'm gonna say you should see poor

485
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:41,680
 things way more than I should see Barbie. I will watch poor things. Yes. Recall that poor things.

486
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,720
 I mean I think I will now it's on Disney Plus but I think I will say that poor things did not get

487
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,360
 like a massive cinema release here and it was months later than yours. So there is a countries

488
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,720
 now I haven't seen it. Yeah there is. I also watch Barbie on a plane. Sorry Alison.

489
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,680
 I mean I think I did watch poor things the very first day it was on Disney Plus so sometimes I

490
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,240
 live in the moment. Where are you putting your various things Liz? So they're all pretty good

491
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:15,280
 too very good actually. I think my current ranking is Spiderman, Barbie, Nimono Dungeons

492
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,080
 and Dragons. I think I'd agree with that. I think I'd probably put poor things above Spiderman although

493
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,520
 it is very close. I might watch poor things and then re-watch Spiderman. I have just seen her of

494
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:32,480
 somebody. A friend out friend of the podcast says that the Wandering Earth 2 is basically a

495
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,920
 remake a better remake of the Wandering Earth in many respects and I thought that was interesting.

496
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,200
 I've not watched the Wandering Earth 2 because the Wandering Earth 1 I thought was extremely bad

497
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,920
 and the Wandering Earth 2 is three hours long and I would have to pay to watch it and I am

498
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,920
 unpersuaded that it will be worth the time or the money. If it lands on free streaming anywhere

499
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,120
 I might watch the first half an hour to see if it's any better but yeah.

500
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:04,800
 Best dramatic presentation short form and it's a return to the old days with multiple doctor who

501
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,000
 finalists. And multiple strange new worlds finalists. It's not really the old days for that though is

502
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,400
 it? I mean that is new. No but multiple finalists from the same TV show. We can only have two now right?

503
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,800
 Isn't there a rule? Do the Wispus Constitution? I just type Wispus and it auto-complete to my

504
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,080
 menu bar now. While this is looking at the Constitution I will say I have watched none of these

505
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,720
 and I will not be watching any of them before the voting deadline because they're not the things

506
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,040
 that I'm going at and going oh I should really make sure to watch this before the voting deadline.

507
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,800
 I think Strangely World is probably better than Doctor Who but I only know that from what my

508
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,280
 friends say about it rather than from any actual intelligent. Yeah my ballot is going to be

509
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,840
 those old scientists and then some space where I have Rhapsody and then Gloria's Purpose and then

510
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,760
 the Two Doctor Who's which I can't remember which episodes they are purely from the titles

511
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:03,600
 but yeah. Wild Blue Yonder is the one with... It's one with a really long corridors right?

512
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:10,160
 Yes yes it is. And then the Giggle. I would put Wild Blue Yonder above the Giggle.

513
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:18,080
 I watched the first of the specials and then it wasn't terrible but you know the series is not

514
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,160
 the science fiction series for me. If there are more than two works in the same category there are

515
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,880
 episodes the same dramatic presentation series only the two works in each category that have the

516
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,000
 most nominations that appear on the final ballot but we already know they didn't disqualify

517
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,600
 anything from this category right? Because they announced the disqualifications. Yes I assume

518
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:44,080
 that if anything had fallen foul of that it would have been announced as a disqualification or there

519
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:50,880
 would have been some thing at the announcement so presumably that means it did not happen.

520
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,600
 Yeah because I was wondering if the other eligible Doctor Who special would have been on there

521
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:02,400
 apart from for that rule right? One sec. All right so I've watched five of these. I haven't watched

522
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,680
 Loki because I haven't watched Loki season two yet so it could be amazing. I don't know what I'm

523
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:13,440
 gonna put top it's either those old scientists or long long time from the last of us might be

524
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,400
 long long time. Those old scientists just for Jack quade's war cliz he deserves the Oscar.

525
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:29,040
 Okay so those old scientists is great in a very sort of referential way. Long long time was like

526
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,000
 genuinely the most I've cried at any television show this year. But you hate crying so clearly

527
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,640
 that makes it bad. I don't know I think there's a cathartic thing to having a good crud jump.

528
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,840
 No I was mostly taking the bass sorry. It's very hard to compare one thing which is basically

529
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:49,600
 super fun and super referential and one thing which is kind of the standout episode that stands

530
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:56,400
 low enough a series I liked but not that much. So those are at my top somewhere and then I think

531
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,600
 it's subspace rhapsody the Giggle and Wild Blue Yonder but kind of under duress because I don't

532
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,400
 like subspace rhapsody that much. Okay and other other episodes should have been above subspace

533
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,000
 rhapsody. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow I agree I would have put that above subspace

534
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,320
 rhapsody. It does not surprise me that the two meme episode to the ones that ended up on the

535
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,200
 ballot though. They're great meme episodes but they're definitely meme episodes. All right shall we

536
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:25,440
 jump straight to fan categories? We shan't talk about fan cast on account of how we have a

537
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,240
 conflict of interest because we're in it. And we love all the fan cast. We love all of the fan casts

538
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,880
 you should listen to all of them and vote for the one you thought was the best. And I mean

539
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,360
 I recuse myself from saying anything about fan artist. I feel like fan artists we also have issues

540
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,640
 fanzine and I'm now feeling slightly fretful because I am not sure whether Black Nerd,

541
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,080
 what Black Nerd problems put into the Hugo package because I went to their website and found it

542
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:58,160
 quite hard to read the content on the website because of the website design. I mean Black Nerd

543
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:04,080
 problems is laid out as what it is which is a magazine so it's not like there's an issue I can

544
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,040
 download. So I think I basically had, I think I ignored the stuff in the voter pack and kind of

545
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:17,360
 went back and scrawled back to stuff from 2023 and kind of read the selection of it. It's pretty fun.

546
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:26,320
 Nice. I like the full lid where Alistair Stuart covers a huge range of stuff that interests him I

547
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:33,440
 guess but it does seem very kind of all sorts of things in a reviews fanzine.

548
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:41,440
 A bit like this podcast. Maybe this episode maybe. I think Journey Planet did very strong work last

549
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:50,480
 year and good issues on a very on a wide range of subjects so and it is also a fanzine in actual

550
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,880
 issues and I like that because I'm old but my and and I have a conflict of interest for idea

551
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,920
 because I am in it but but my vote will probably go to idea despite that because I liked everything

552
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,960
 else in it quite a lot as well. Cool. Yeah I think it's a very solid list I feel I should mention that

553
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,600
 nerds of a feather do some great reviewing and unofficial Hugo book club, vlog do some great posts

554
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,240
 as well. I think we probably said that last year but I mean I think from this list I would be happy

555
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:24,160
 with any of those winning. I think I will say I recommended a website on various discords a few

556
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:31,200
 weeks ago called Rascal. Rascal is doing a pledge drive and when you like look at the little snippet

557
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:38,560
 that comes up on discord it says that they are "voicy" which is an adjective which basically means the

558
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:45,360
 the voice of the journalist comes through very strongly and I think black nerd problems I enjoy

559
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:52,080
 because I think it is a voicey. Reading the articles like I really feel like an idea for what it would

560
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:58,480
 be like to talk to that author sort of in the pub or in the bar and I really like that. I particularly

561
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:04,720
 liked the spider verse. That is a good adjective and voicey is one of the things I am looking for in

562
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,160
 fanzines in general that I think fanzines are a good place for it that professional magazines are

563
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:16,800
 much less likely to have that feature and one of the things you the point about doing community

564
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,160
 content is that it is off the community and and your verse is very important. Yeah I think we are

565
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,840
 kind of reinventing new journalism or whatever it is that became new games journalism which became

566
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,440
 the idea that you can kind of use more kind of personal anecdotes and so on so I think this

567
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:38,720
 is not a new idea. I really hate the adjective "voicy" for some reason. That's fair. I think I just to

568
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:47,040
 say Rascal started with the TTRPG new games manifesto so I think they are explicitly aiming for that

569
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:53,360
 in their output. Yeah and it's all over the place right lots of journalism which like you know how

570
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,760
 much should you have of the personal and how much should you have of the journalistic and what is

571
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,800
 your balance and fanzines a good example of that but maybe that's a discussion for another time.

572
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:09,600
 "Fan-reya, I'm gonna vote for Bit of Corella because I still love midnight belts." God I laughed

573
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:17,520
 such a kind of like cynical laugh at today's midnight pals, midnight society. I'm not sure I've

574
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,960
 read today's. Although what about "Posey Parker?" Yeah the punchline of that one is just like

575
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:33,840
 it's funny but painful. Yeah I do not disagree. Also it's got the word "beevagina" as in

576
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:41,920
 my totally normal party of beevagina women which yeah it's quite funny. Ah she's so good. Yeah I'm

577
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,440
 gonna put her at the top of my ballot. They're all good fan writers Brent. I find this category

578
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:55,200
 very difficult to decide on. I like aspects of what all of these writers do. I don't really know how

579
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:01,280
 I'm gonna rank them yet. I know. I do work from bottom but I do basically do the top half of the

580
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,120
 ballot before the bottom half so these are the ones that I've done less reading on so far. We do

581
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,440
 have another three weeks as we know over three weeks as we record before the deadline listeners

582
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:15,040
 which is why we have not all finished the reading but we are not going to have another chance to

583
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:21,840
 record if we want to get this out to you the listener. You do not have over three weeks John you have

584
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:30,480
 13 days. Boo. Just saying. Shh. Let's shh. Load star understanding. Yeah I've not I've read one of

585
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:37,360
 the load stars. I liked it a great deal but I've not read the others. I've read two. Which ones?

586
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:42,560
 Guess which one I liked most John. And "Reveler" by Francis Hardink. Correct. What I was gonna say

587
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:47,440
 what author do I like nearly as much as Adrian Tchaikovsky and it is obviously Francis Hardink.

588
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,480
 Fair enough. And "Reveler" is pretty good. I don't think it's like her top book but you know

589
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,720
 second best Francis Hardink so pretty good. I did enjoy Liberty's daughter but not as much

590
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:04,000
 and I will probably read one or two of the others or at least I will try. I really liked to

591
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,960
 shape a dragon's breath because it made me so angry about Indigenous peoples and the way they

592
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,640
 are treated in a way that I thoroughly enjoyed and also I read it because it crosses off

593
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:22,160
 north of the astounding and north of the load star in one book. Life hack. Smart. Yeah I've

594
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:29,280
 also nothing to say on the sound links I haven't read enough yet. I'm trying. I have read all of

595
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:37,360
 them except for M.X. Liu. Mm hmm. Well done. I will say the Sunidin did not gel.

596
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,280
 I put the Sunidin down halfway through with a plan to come back to it after the deadline

597
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:50,160
 but I was finding it very slow going. I, Jang, I've read I Am I and I've read the short story that

598
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,920
 was in on Cami and although it was pretty good. Hannah Kaina I'm reading God Killer and God Killer

599
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,000
 was a blessed relief because it was just solid and I really needed a book that wasn't like incredibly

600
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,360
 incredibly anger inducing or incredibly slow. Like I just I'm reading it the pages go quick.

601
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,600
 I like it a lot. It's very good. Not going to put her at the top but I would happily read more by

602
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:18,320
 that author and Jiren Jade Zhao. I remember liking Iron Widow a great deal. It has been a while since

603
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,800
 I read it but I do remember thinking it was cool. At the moment I'm probably putting

604
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,720
 Monaco Black Goose at the top because I really liked to shape a dragon's breath.

605
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,920
 But I need to read the rest. I need to finish the Kaina and I need to read and I need to read

606
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:38,480
 something by MX Lou before I can vote competently. But I'm almost there. I've just need to read another

607
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:45,520
 one, two, three, four, five, six books. Making the to heat the

608
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,160
 brierly voting competence threshold. In that that's to hit that in both loads that are

609
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,440
 understanding and to vote in most of the others. Anything else on the Hugo Awards?

610
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,200
 No that was a lot.

611
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:03,760
 [Music]

612
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,680
 So we're going to do picks because you've not heard enough of our opinions about science fiction

613
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:16,080
 this episode and I'm going to pick Star Wars Jedi Survivor, the adventures of a good boy and his

614
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:21,360
 owner. The good boy is called BD1 and he runs around and he slots into things and he goes

615
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:26,880
 "brom" and he's great and there's also a ginger guy and the ginger guy is pretty okay and has a

616
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,920
 lightsaber and there's also "do you play as the droid? Do you play as the droid?"

617
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:39,600
 You play as them and they are a team but more you play as as Cal. It's good. It's basically

618
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:45,040
 they looked at the first game and they went "how do we improve every single aspect of this game in

619
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:51,440
 the second game?" and then they did and that is the sort of sequel I like. It is bigger, it has more

620
00:58:51,440 --> 00:59:00,160
 open world bits which feel better, it has a more compelling story, it has better villains,

621
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:07,920
 it's just real good. One of the best Star Wars but I never picked Jedi Fallen Order and I will say

622
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,120
 it's also a blessed relief because before these games there hadn't been a single player Star Wars

623
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,880
 game that was worth playing for at least a decade and that depends how you define the Star Wars game

624
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,800
 force unleashed which I thought was pretty bad so it's just nice to have good Star Wars video

625
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:30,880
 games again for what I would argue is the first time in a very long time and that is lovely.

626
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,400
 "What's your ranking of the best game category John?"

627
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:42,160
 Chance of Sinard, Alan Wake 2, Star Wars Jedi Survivor, Dredge, Baldur's Gate 3. I have got to

628
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,520
 the bit of Baldur's Gate 3 where there's a game that's fun though so that's nice.

629
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,360
 "So yes one of the problems I have with Baldur's Gate 3 is that every so often I would be in combat

630
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:55,280
 and I would go "God I remember so much of this sort of thing from a very long time ago both in

631
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,640
 tabletop role playing and in video games and I didn't like it then and I don't."

632
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,320
 "Liz how are you ranking the video games?"

633
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,200
 "Chance of Sinard and then Dredge."

634
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,760
 "There's a much shorter list than mine."

635
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:16,000
 "I mean the thing is that I have not played the Zelda game yet and I cannot play Alan Wake 2,

636
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,640
 Baldur's Gate 3 or Star Wars Jedi Survivor because I have not bought a PlayStation 5."

637
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,560
 "Ah that is true, that is fair."

638
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:27,200
 "So that is a bit of an issue. I would like to play Baldur's Gate 3 and Alan Wake sounds good and I

639
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,920
 played a bit of Star Wars Jedi for an order and it was quite fun but none of them are quite the

640
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,200
 thing that makes me get a PlayStation 5." "Baldur's Gate 3 plays on your Mac?"

641
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,360
 "Yeah it's my work Mac. I'm not installing Baldur's Gate 3 on it. I also don't want to play it on a

642
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,760
 Mac where it's shit. I want to play it on a PlayStation where it actually runs. I don't want to play it

643
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,000
 at five frames per second."

644
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,160
 "That might also be a problem I'm having with it."

645
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,560
 "I will also say that although I initially thought that Alice in Complaint about loading screens

646
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:59,120
 was a Mac specific one, fuck me the loading screens take a long time on a PlayStation 5.

647
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:05,360
 What is going on? The SSD is designed to be like lightning and I'm waiting like over a minute

648
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:10,880
 for the neck and I'm like what is happening? Like I was and it's really annoying. I would

649
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,240
 make more sense to me if I was loading a game and it wasn't in memory but when I'm reloading the

650
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:20,880
 same combat again why is that not cached? Like why does that take a long time? It is baffling.

651
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,480
 I don't want to sound it. At someone with ADHD it's very annoying."

652
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:32,320
 "Things I don't care about in games as a rule extensive texture scenery voice acting."

653
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,000
 "But like Horizon Zero Dawn didn't have this level of loading screen."

654
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,160
 "The voice acting in video games is great."

655
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:43,200
 "I click through most of it so I read what's at the bottom of the screen and I go right well

656
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,280
 I could wait 20 minutes while I have this conversation or I could click onto the next thing.

657
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,000
 My life is too short. I read books guys.

658
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,160
 Not if I'm an architect or you don't apparently. I read some books."

659
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,440
 "I don't think the voice acting is what makes the loading take a long time."

660
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,600
 "I think there's just a lot of stuff right?"

661
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,360
 "There's definitely a lot of stuff."

662
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:08,480
 "It loads a huge area and you could go anywhere and there are like 97 different things you could

663
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,680
 do and it loads them all in while you're waiting rather than micro loading it as you're playing the

664
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,960
 game. I do not understand this but you know somebody in our audience will understand why

665
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,120
 why we have these long loading screens."

666
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,800
 "Do either of you want to do pics?"

667
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,360
 "No I'm good. I want to have my dinner."

668
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:30,080
 "I've played a lot more animal well and and I've also played Quite a bit of Cinka Pouse

669
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,240
 which I think I've probably also previously picked but if not I can't really pick three video games

670
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,360
 at a row can I?"

671
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,800
 "There's no lore against it."

672
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,240
 "I can pick Cinka Pouse if you like."

673
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,320
 "What is Cinka Pouse?"

674
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:48,000
 Cinka Pouse is probably well in my view but not everybody's view the best of the roguelikes by

675
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:55,760
 Michael Bro who is an independent game designer who game designers love but lots of other people

676
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:02,720
 find a bit strange and it is a game in which you are a sorcerer and you have five ones and you

677
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:08,000
 are on a five by five grid with five monsters and you do not know what any of the ones do and

678
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,640
 you find out what the ones do by firing them at things and noting down what happens or other

679
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:20,080
 game notes are down for you and to make it better. At the time when he designed it Bro was living

680
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:24,400
 in Portugal and he was learning Portuguese so the entire game text is in Portuguese

681
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:30,000
 and people got very angry about this but of course you know deciphering what the game text is telling

682
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,520
 you is part of the puzzle you could perfectly well work it out without knowing any Portuguese

683
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:41,840
 and after some years of this game existing and people whining about the fact that it was only

684
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:47,920
 in Portuguese asking for translation he did in fact translate the entire game into German

685
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,720
 so it's now available in Portuguese German and it is fabulous it is so good.

686
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,840
 So you play through five screens with your five unknown ones and then you finish that game

687
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:04,720
 and you start a new game holding the points you've got from that game so that you can play

688
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:10,080
 multiple games in a row and there is so much depth to this and so much interest in it but it is

689
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:16,640
 just another extremely nerdy roguelike of the salt that I like so you know you can get it on

690
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:21,920
 IOS and some other things but I play it on IOS. Fabulous game one of the people I play it with

691
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,440
 us by daughter so we come round and we put the turn it over to the news to the big screen and then

692
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:34,160
 we sit there arguing about what we should do next and what is the most likely thing to avoid us

693
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:40,720
 being killed by a frog again. Way! Essentially if you like extremely technical nerdy roguelikes

694
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:45,200
 you should definitely play this game but you probably already have. Turns out I already own

695
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:51,920
 Cinco Paus because I bought the bundle for Rachel, Justice and Equality on itch and it was in that

696
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:58,000
 bundle. This often happens in the games good. That was the Ulta. podcast and it's goodbye from me.

697
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,120
 It's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me.
