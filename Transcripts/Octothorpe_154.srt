00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,920
Hello listeners, it's John here.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:12,560
Just to let you know that last year we recused ourselves from Hugo Award consideration, but this year we are unrecused, so we are eligible for your nomination, as are a lot of other fine fan casts.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,320
On with the show!

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,520
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 154th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:43,680
Fiction fandom, which is realizing that the GP dancing with the very burly man is actually God on the 26th of February 2026.

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,719
I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,160
I'm Alison Scott.

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,300
And I'm Liz Batty.

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,620
We had some letters.

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,940
And first I'll start out with a comment from one Andrew Hogg.

11
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,500
on Discord who says the UK does not have the same school holidays everywhere.

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,059
If only someone had pointed that out on the record.

13
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,180
So our Alison has just forgotten, so this is not funny to Alison at all.

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,180
I mean you did though, you did.

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,180
No, but Liz made us cut it.

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,060
Yes.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,580
I didn't realise this.

18
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:16,340
And then we got a letter.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:25,079
I mean I re this podcast is not a democracy, but you had a choice between another five minutes of discussion of UK school holiday dates or

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,940
me shouting at them till they stopped doing it.

21
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,740
I I think I was doing you a service.

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,420
My co-hosts might disagree.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,020
Certainly Andrew disagrees.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,880
He would like to hear more discourse about school holiday dates.

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,160
Um can I mention the weather, because we had one day.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,120
Is it is the weather nice in Thailand at the moment, Liz?

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,420
I mean Divine Nice.

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,020
Ha have I seen the sun?

29
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,660
Yes.

30
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,580
Do I see the sun pretty much every day?

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,060
Yes.

32
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,300
Yeah, okay, so we have had w

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,220
Uh yesterday it stopped raining for a day and we had a lovely day.

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,460
It was cold and clear and really nice and I went for a nice walk to some charity shop.

35
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,500
And today it's raining in here and I am so fed up.

36
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,900
That's that's my weather content for this episode.

37
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,380
Can we go back to discussing the school holidays?

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,420
We heard uh from Chris Rajay Garcia

39
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:21,220
I should say we are recording uh only a few days after we released uh last week's episode, but Chris, as usual, has locked us within fractions of a second of listening.

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,980
Possibly he's locking at the same time he is listening, while also, I don't know

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,140
r r running the world.

42
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,700
I don't know.

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,060
Chris, write in.

44
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,340
He has a recommendation.

45
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,140
He says, I don't know if you've all mentioned there is no anti-mimetics division, but I think it'll make an excellent pick for one of you.

46
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,780
I loved it.

47
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,820
Sounds really good Chris.

48
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,900
We should probably go and find that and read it.

49
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,220
I I I get that you two both get this joke.

50
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,100
Yes.

51
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:50,180
And if making a running joke leads you to eventually go and read a really good book, then I'm just not gonna be guilty about it at all.

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
I've just never heard of I've just never heard of it.

53
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,400
So Chris also says that um he's excited for the exploratory group to bring Africa a world con.

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,159
It's a great idea and he's hoping they figure out a way to bid for Nairobi because he has got a great idea for a theme song.

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,079
Mmm I hope you're all hearing the theme song in your head right now.

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,800
For what?

57
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,160
I don't know if you're just doing a bit now or if you've really forgotten.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,960
That's the problem.

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
This is a wild episode.

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,320
Reviews on COMA on COBA for there is no anti-limitative evidence division are

61
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,900
Quality, mind-bending, outstanding, and utter nonsense.

62
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,340
Shall I go back to Chris's letter?

63
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,300
Yes

64
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,660
Uh Chris says he uh um loved the Nuremberg uh bid website that we mentioned last time.

65
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,180
Um and he

66
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:51,820
He said he's seen some looking at the con as a carpet bagger con, which would be when you um bring in a bring in a team to run a con in a place which is

67
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,640
good but none of you have many connections to it.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,040
But that seems like the opposite of Nuremberg where it's two people with a very strong connection to Nuremberg uh bringing in other people to assist.

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,880
So uh not sure where that one's come from.

70
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,280
But yeah he says he does like the idea of a world combing world not just in location but in staffing.

71
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,500
Um, I think that is always true.

72
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:16,660
You want to have at least some core of people who know and can highlight why your bid site is good, but also yeah, bring in people from all over the world.

73
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,700
That's why we're all welcome.

74
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:29,060
Chris says one of the things he loved about the Montreal Worldcon is that you could hear the Francophone Music Festival, uh which we're doing at the same time, and the crossover was good for the vibe, uh, but it is a problem for hotel rooms

75
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
So I think that's enough, Chris.

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
He talks about TAF and so on and we'll do that.

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,600
But there's also a thing there's also a thing where the WorldCom would be at the end of a robotics festival.

78
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:48,460
So presumably you don't want there to be a robotics festival and another summer festival and a WorldCom because that then gets real crowded

79
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
'Cause it's already gonna be coming at the uh like it's already dovetailing with a festival.

80
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,960
I think it's important not to forget that, probably.

81
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,240
Oh I see, I thought it was like right at the end of the festival, rather than kinda crossing over.

82
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,940
I don't I mean but I suspect some people will still be in town from that, right?

83
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,060
Like it's not Yeah.

84
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,700
I don't know.

85
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,260
I don't know enough about Nuremberg's festival scene.

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,140
No, but I think we are gonna find out.

87
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,220
We are gonna find out.

88
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,980
That is true.

89
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:22,380
Chris also brings us on quite nicely to our next topic by bringing up the sport of escalator curling.

90
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,160
Yes.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,400
That was a segue for you, John.

92
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Yeah, so um Escalator Curling, um, he basically notes that

93
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,380
It it's greatly improved played going down the escalator, but becomes very bad if played going up the escalator.

94
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,979
So that is an important point.

95
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,900
Other people on Facebook made some suggestions.

96
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,360
So Ivan Sinner suggested the most futile sport would be tug of war with two teams hopelessly heading towards each other.

97
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,240
Seems good.

98
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,360
Uh and then

99
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:04,180
Phil Dyson chimed in saying that sports not improved by play being played on a C C D escalator are water polo, figure skating, hand gliding, and horse racing.

100
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,660
I think hand gliding could work.

101
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,580
Horse racing uh is never I I disagree with horse racing.

102
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,620
A Thousand Blues by Xion Ran Chon.

103
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,500
Um I'm sorry if I pronounce that wrong, they're a Korean author, is is kind of set around horse racing, uh and it may be very cross in a good way.

104
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:30,040
But Phil also mentioned that some of the sports definitely improved would be darts, golf, archery, bobsleigh, and clay pigeon shooting.

105
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,979
I feel hang gliding doesn't really gain or suffer from the escalator unless you're doing it wrong.

106
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,940
Oh interesting.

107
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,699
Well it does if you start at the bottom.

108
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940
Can you hang glide up an escalator?

109
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:42,940
Regus right in.

110
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,960
Kev McVeigh suggests hurling.

111
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,440
I've had some experiences of hurling on an escalator and I don't recommend it.

112
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,720
Aw man.

113
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,200
Alison!

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
And then Alison had an idea.

115
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,320
I had two ideas now because you Chris mentioned curling and of course curling's great because escalators already have brushes.

116
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:02,680
Ah.

117
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,800
Yeah.

118
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,880
And then my idea for a sport you should do on an escalator is jugger.

119
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,040
See Octhorpe's passim.

120
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,440
I don't think it would make it any madder as a sport.

121
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,880
And I still haven't

122
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:22,759
I still haven't watched the film, which means I continue to pay fifty cents, one pound ninety nine a month for fifty cent action until I get round to it.

123
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:31,180
I can't remember if we noted in the episode that it's on Fifty Cent's bespoke streaming service, but uh if we didn't listeners, it is and it's yeah.

124
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,580
Allison is in the pocket of Big Fifty Cent.

125
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,300
I am.

126
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,540
I may watch other action movies.

127
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:38,940
Who's charging her somewhere in the region of three dollars a month?

128
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:48,060
It it's not a lot of money, is it, for a uh for a hand curated set of action I mean, if you s like subscribe to somebody's personal podcast, I feel like it's a bit like that.

129
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:48,520
Yes.

130
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,639
And I subscribe to a bunch of podcasts, so yeah.

131
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,080
I think fifty cents probably good without your three dollars a month though.

132
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,360
I think he's doing all right

133
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,840
Do you reckon?

134
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,360
I I I imagine he has staff and I imagine they need feeding.

135
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah, but I think most I I feel most podcasts I support are slightly more towards the impoverished end of the scale than fifty cent

136
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,160
Could be wrong.

137
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,600
Sure that's true.

138
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:20,680
Well, I mean it's probably more than fifty cent, but I assume that somewhere fifty cent has a chap who curates his handpicked movies for him who's not fifty cent

139
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,879
And and that's the person I'm supporting by my No, I'm only supporting by mistake because I'm bad at cancelling things, guys.

140
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,400
I need to watch the movie.

141
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,199
Yes.

142
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,399
I I'll watch it next week and then it can be my pick.

143
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:37,459
I have had a number of occasions where I've said to Stephen, Do you want to watch an eighteen rated movie about a mad sport?

144
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,899
And he's been like, No, how about another episode of the expansive?

145
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Well if that means you might actually finish Expanse this decade We are we are on the we are one episode away from the end of season four so I assert we are gonna finish the Expanse in due Nice

146
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,280
I seem to remember I quite like season five.

147
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,600
Can I make a final comment on escalator sport?

148
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,240
Yeah.

149
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:06,880
So we we we did get a comment from Brian Nisbet who said that the Dublin in twenty twenty nine bid is always listening after we suggested uh playing sports on the escalators.

150
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,760
Brian

151
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,399
What level do I have to support the 2029 Mid in order to be your um head of Escalator Sports?

152
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
I might regret this.

153
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,260
I think Ryan might regret this.

154
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,780
I mean you know, you're you've got a lot of experience in programming.

155
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,660
That's true.

156
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,700
Mm-hmm Because I like to I I have a whole

157
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,160
handmade game called live action video games and I quite like to run live action video games on the Escalators at Dublin 2029.

158
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,200
I feel like there are a bunch of video games that are appropriate for this like Donkey Kong

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I mean main mostly Donkey Kong really.

160
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,600
Super Mario Brothers.

161
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,280
Uh Angry Birds?

162
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,480
Angry Birds?

163
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,040
Yeah.

164
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,400
I do think people are gonna write in again, guys

165
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,880
Maybe.

166
00:09:51,200 --> 00:10:02,160
We heard on Mastodon from Johnny who says he has just read his first Adrian Tchaikovsky novel, thanks to us.

167
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,940
Uh he just finished Elder Race.

168
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,660
Uh thought it was absolutely excellent and definitely one of his favourite science fiction books.

169
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,500
Yeah, no, Elder Race is great.

170
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,300
It was nominated for the Hugo Award in 2022 in the best novella category.

171
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,700
Uh and the uh it's just it's just really good.

172
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,780
Highly recommend anyone who has not read it.

173
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,700
Um I think it's one of Trikowski's sort of it's in the top quartile.

174
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,660
It's real good.

175
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,260
I'm glad you enjoyed it, Johnny.

176
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,620
Guess what I'm reading, John?

177
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,260
Uh are you reading Elder Race?

178
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:32,740
No.

179
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,340
I'm reading a Tchaikovsky book.

180
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,300
Shroud.

181
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,180
Mm no.

182
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,940
City of Last Chances.

183
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,540
No, I'm made in pretenders to the throne of God.

184
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,140
Ah oo.

185
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,700
Just came out and landed on my Kindle and I thought, ooh, yes.

186
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,940
That's the is that the novella?

187
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,620
No, that's the new novel.

188
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,500
What?

189
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,980
I didn't know it was out.

190
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,860
Yes.

191
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,420
Yes.

192
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,060
Fuck.

193
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,940
Right, hang on.

194
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,620
Where's my credit card?

195
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,340
You guys talk amongst yourselves.

196
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,900
One of you's probably got a locks read or something, right?

197
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,460
We also heard from Paul Beemer.

198
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:13,620
um who mentioned escalator netball because obviously there was um there were giant escalators at Seattle and we c they clearly missed the trick.

199
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:26,000
He mentions that Paul Cornell is the cricket ambassador to the US, particularly at US convention uh science fiction conventions, and I was like, I I I wonder if that's something that Major League Cricket knows anything about

200
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,900
But there we go.

201
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,580
Convergence is now at a less cricket friendly hotel.

202
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,340
So apparently they were playing cricket.

203
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,460
So um in the corridors, yeah.

204
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,300
And yeah, no, that sounds good.

205
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:37,860
Um

206
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,420
'Cause yeah, no, it sounds good except if you're a hotel uh like venue liaison.

207
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,339
Um 'cause cricket cricket has quite a hard ball.

208
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:47,139
Um I

209
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,060
Are we sure they were playing in the corridors rather than, you know, outdoors like more sensible people?

210
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,060
I'm I might be wrong, but I got the impression it was in the corridors.

211
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,740
Paul, right and then let us know.

212
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,580
And what were the corridors like after?

213
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
He's 'cause Paul

214
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:10,460
Paul says no more cricket in quotation marks panels, which makes me think that these might have been in maybe not in the corridors, maybe in programme rooms.

215
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,580
No, I mean I've

216
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,680
This is because it's not really a funny joke, but I think he actually was doing like a demonstration outside in the car park and now they're no longer in a place where you can do that.

217
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:19,720
But anyway

218
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,620
Oh, sad.

219
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,940
Uh that's less funny, so let's not mention it.

220
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,660
He thinks there are concentric circles of fandom, people who attend SF Cons, a circle of people who volunteer can at

221
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:37,080
SF Cons, the circle of people who help put on SF Cons, and inside of that are the people who go to Smopcons and such things.

222
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:44,279
I feel like people who go to SmovCons are about as down the rabbit hole as you can get the true fear wall, crunchy core or nutty nugget.

223
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,820
And you know what, Paul?

224
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,339
You have no idea.

225
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,420
That's just what they want you to think.

226
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,339
So he says, I'm somewhere between volunteer and help put on.

227
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,459
He's doing the

228
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:01,399
a photography team for LA Con, but he says, I am not yet at the point that worldcons are looking to recruit me regularly.

229
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,720
And this seems astonishing to me because I think almost everyone is at the point where world cons are looking to recruit you regularly.

230
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,820
Unless you've actually done something wrong.

231
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,660
Which I think you've definitely not.

232
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,300
I reckon if anyone from a Worldcon is listening, I'm just saying Paul Weimer.

233
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,140
Maybe, maybe uh Yeah, yeah, yeah.

234
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,980
No, you definitely want him on your team.

235
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,780
Yeah.

236
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,380
LA Con 5 has announced that the Hugo nominations are open.

237
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:39,259
You're eligible to nominate if you were became a member of LA Con 5 by January 31st or were a member of Seattle.

238
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,300
It you nominate on their website just using a system or you can post one in.

239
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,580
I mean I'm if you're listening to this and you're posting one in, how are you listening to this?

240
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,180
The nominations close on Saturday, March twenty-eighth.

241
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,320
at nine AM Pacific time, which is not the midnight, so you know, but it does leave you the whole day that day if you're in the UK.

242
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
Um, up till four o'clock.

243
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,120
That's

244
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,400
Surely wrong.

245
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,760
No, I'm pretty sure that's wrong.

246
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,120
I'm pretty sure it says four o'clock GMT, but they actually mean five o'clock.

247
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,920
Yeah, but that isn't that in the window where the clocks have changed in one and not the other?

248
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
Uh maybe.

249
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,920
Yeah, pretty sure.

250
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
That's usually about that time of year, right?

251
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,760
Yeah, because we'll change Yep, nope, no, it is correct.

252
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,280
They're right, I'm wrong.

253
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,720
Talking bollocks as usual.

254
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:34,440
If you're relying on us to know exactly when Hugo nominations close, then I've got bad news for you, but we are not always one hundred percent accurate.

255
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,640
That's not really uh that's not really our vibe, is it?

256
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,820
I mean do people listen to this podcast for absolute pinpoint accuracy?

257
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,660
I will keep this in because I think it is useful for our listeners to remember that that is in the window where it's not eight hours different.

258
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,000
'Cause most of the time I do think oh it's just eight hours away and that I always do get confused by the two weeks.

259
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,360
Especially with meetings happening with American colleagues.

260
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:01,019
I'm always someone is always an hour out for those meetings in those two week gaps every year.

261
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
So like it is it is common to forget.

262
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,779
Yeah th th th this is an amazingly not yet solved problem.

263
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,519
Well they just need to go back to doing it the old way and then it'd be fine.

264
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,240
Welcome to living in a place with no daylight savings time.

265
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,760
I was gonna say the the solution is to not have daylight savings time.

266
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,959
As you well know, because I make you change the time of podcast recording.

267
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,639
That might have been a slightly political thing.

268
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,880
Anyway, so yes, get your nominations in.

269
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,600
Um I think next time we're gonna have a latter about what we're nominating and why.

270
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,800
Is that right, guys?

271
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,600
Sure.

272
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,240
I mean we can do some now if you'd like, or we could do it next time.

273
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,360
How are we doing for time?

274
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,120
How much nonsense have we talked?

275
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,200
Ooh, twenty-three minutes of nonsense.

276
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,560
I'm happy to, if people want to.

277
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:53,600
I need I really need to have a link to the Hugo Speech Hugo Awards Preach Sheet of Doom that's just like a favourite on my um desktop because like I always forget where it actually is.

278
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,580
We should put that in the show notes.

279
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:05,220
We had a couple of people on our Facebook comment about there is no anti-Memetics division and there was a question raised about whether or not it is eligible for a Hugo Award.

280
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,880
I believe it is for two reasons.

281
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Firstly, the book as published in its current form is different to the version that was published on the STP wiki and by the author.

282
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:25,400
And there is precedent for self-published works being eligible on first professional publication because Old Man's War won the Hugo Award in 2006.

283
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,459
but it was originally self-published in 2002.

284
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,660
So those two things lead me to believe that it is eligible.

285
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,980
It's certainly eligible for the Clark Award.

286
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,620
Um so I believe the same

287
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,319
I've sort of been taking it as red that it'll also be eligible for the clo for the uh Hugo Award.

288
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,480
Um and I will be nominating it.

289
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,639
I would encourage everyone else to do the same.

290
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:51,800
Yeah, I mean there's some recency bias going on here because I read it only a few weeks ago, but I think it's gonna be on my list as well.

291
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,240
I read it m last year and yeah.

292
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,160
I don't think I've read it.

293
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,180
B what else might I m nominate in book?

294
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:02,940
Well you guys nominate for novel.

295
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,459
Yeah, so there's a f a few things that I think I've mentioned before and picked but

296
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,679
I'm still considering uh The Raven Scholar by Antonio Hodgson.

297
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,679
I did like The Buffalo Hunter Hunter by Stephen Graham Jones.

298
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,659
Um The Incandescent by Emily Tesch.

299
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,899
Although I'm not sure it even I mean I'm not that's one where I think it's a lock to be on it doesn't even need my nomination, but we'll see.

300
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:33,640
And then there's a bunch of other stuff that's like on my list of oh I should get round to that in the next month and a half to n time to nominate and let's see if I actually do.

301
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,080
Yep, that's fair.

302
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,760
What about you, Alison?

303
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,800
I think I think I'm probably gonna ha put a drop of corruption on my list, even though I didn't like it quite

304
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:45,380
Quite as much as the first one.

305
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,899
But I still liked it a whole lot.

306
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,179
By whom?

307
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,419
Um by Robert Jackson Bennett.

308
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,779
Um and as you say, I think the the the incandescent is unlikely to

309
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,299
need help from us.

310
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,019
Oh yes, uh Luminous by Sylvia Park I think is also going to be on my list.

311
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,580
Again, I picked it a while back

312
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,460
Yes, I have read that and I will probably also um nominate that.

313
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,580
I thought it was very, very good.

314
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,580
I need to read more books.

315
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,180
Um and then I also might nominate.

316
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,060
I there have been a lot of good books this year.

317
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,940
Agreed.

318
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,060
Probably also gonna nominate the incandescent

319
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,539
Very strong chance I'll nominate when there are wolves again.

320
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,340
Well yes.

321
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:28,740
Yeah.

322
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,500
In novella I will nominate the Tyrant Philosophers Novella.

323
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,600
Um, 'cause uh well, I will read it first but then I will nominate it.

324
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,560
Well, I mean

325
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:49,360
Unless it's a significant drop in quality from all the other like books in that series which are the best things he's written, like um I know me.

326
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,240
Yeah, it's it's it's as certain to be a lock as as as i as you can really.

327
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,740
Yeah.

328
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,940
And a couple of other things I've read that like I'm bounced about.

329
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,620
Slow gods by Claire North.

330
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,419
Uh on the calculation of volume by Solvage Ballet.

331
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,500
I don't know if that's how you pronounce that, sorry.

332
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:11,060
Uh Beautyland by Marie-Helene Bertino, The Dream Hotel by Leila Lamani, and Every Version of You by Grace Chan.

333
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,300
I enjoyed all of those very much as well.

334
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,840
So they're all bounced around my head.

335
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Oh and um The Salt Oracle by Lorraine Wilson I really liked.

336
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,279
I would say that the thing with on the calculation of volume is I think there's like

337
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,500
three or four of them eligible?

338
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,179
Ah, I think there's three eligible, numbers one, two, and three.

339
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,019
I don't know which one will get on the ballot.

340
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,740
Does that get well, I think none of them, but

341
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,539
Oh I dunno, it's had buzz.

342
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,340
Mmm.

343
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:40,779
And it's a novella.

344
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,019
Oh, is it a nov you think it's a novella?

345
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,899
Uh oh, I'm actually not sure, but it didn't feel very novelly.

346
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:48,700
Mmm

347
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,279
Yeah, I have no idea the word count on that.

348
00:19:51,440 --> 00:20:00,240
There's at least three volumes which are potentially eligible in either novel or novella, depending how long they are, and then possibly series depending on how long all three of them are.

349
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,120
But I've read the first one and I didn't think it was really sufficiently Hugo-y that it's gonna get on a Hugo ballot, but never say never.

350
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,840
Maybe not.

351
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,760
I am incorrect, it is fifty-two thousand words, so it just squeaks into novel and therefore yes I suspect you are right.

352
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,280
I think if it was novella length it would be a lock, but I think if it's novel length, I have much more doubt.

353
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:20,920
Yes.

354
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,960
Yes, it's too long, isn't it, to to to do the c if it quacks like a duck thing.

355
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,120
Yeah, it's not within ten percent.

356
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,060
They're all incredibly bad lengths for Hugo purposes.

357
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,860
Which might not have been the author's primary concern.

358
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,620
And that means that there's probably not enough in the three volumes to be eligible for best series.

359
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:47,240
And remember that last year it was the Singing Hill Cycle was the one that got nominated.

360
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,960
Well, the Singing Hill Cycle would have been nominated last year except for not having enough words at the time.

361
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,880
So do be careful about the word count requirement in Best Series.

362
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,480
Yeah, my best guess is that there are about 180,000 words combined, the first three.

363
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,120
Don't think the fourth one was published in 2025.

364
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,200
But I think what I'm hearing is you think they're good and I should read them.

365
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,180
Yes.

366
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,980
I read the first one, didn't really like it.

367
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,260
I don't think they're your kind of thing, but could be wrong.

368
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,660
I didn't dislike it, it's just not my

369
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,260
Yeah.

370
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:29,539
I am gonna recommend uh so this is not directly recommendation, but I will say that uh

371
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:37,299
Neil Harrison, sometime listener of the pod, um has a nice uh list of novels in translation.

372
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:45,580
Um, because look, the Lux Award this year has a best translated novel category and he lists a bunch of translated novels he has read.

373
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,620
Ne

374
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:58,799
or and one or two that sound interesting and I think he's read way more novels in translation than I have and so I'm gonna put that in the show notes and if any of them look interesting you've got plenty of time to go and read them before the twenty eighth of March

375
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,820
Do we have anything any other categories we want to burningly report any nominations in?

376
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,740
That was terribly worded.

377
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,620
Yes

378
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:18,140
So obviously and this is not gonna come as a big surprise to anybody who knows me or has heard me bleach on about it for the last year, but obviously I'm going to nominate Blueprints.

379
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,200
in the best game category.

380
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,279
And I am just looking at the list of suggestions here.

381
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,880
There's one game I haven't played that I should probably play before or start playing before nominations start.

382
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,799
Is that Hades 2?

383
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,860
That is Hades II.

384
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:41,420
There's a re I only I haven't played it because I'm worried that I will drop into a Hades II-shaped hole for a month and that will be it for for me for a month.

385
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,020
And there are a couple of others but otherwise there's quite a lot of things here I think, Oh, but that's not as good as Blueprint.

386
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:52,180
And I should think about what other games I have played because every year I nominate a bunch of games that do not appear in any w

387
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,279
uh appear on anybody's radar because they're tiny little indie nonsense.

388
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,240
And every year they don't get anywhere because they don't appear on anyone's radar 'cause they're tiny little indie nonsense.

389
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,880
So you know that's

390
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:10,460
Yes, I mean Alison when you said I should read more books, I didn't say maybe if you took ten percent of your blueprint hours and turned them into reading hours you'd read more books.

391
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,540
But I think if you take You're you're not counting the UFO fifty hours, but UFO fifty is definitely not eligible.

392
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:23,380
I think if we take ten percent of your proposed Hades two hours and put them into, say, novellas, you could read a chunk.

393
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,660
Yeah, absolutely.

394
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,520
So possibly eligible, I think, in Best Game is the Lord of the Rings fate of the Fellowship board game.

395
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:31,160
Oh yeah.

396
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,640
Fellowship of the Ring trick taking?

397
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,460
No, that's different.

398
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,900
The fate of the fellowship.

399
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,540
Oh, the fate of the fellowship, which is the pandemic one.

400
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,100
Yes.

401
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,780
Which I think is better I um it's very, very good.

402
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,540
But it won't make it on because it's a board game.

403
00:23:48,120 --> 00:24:01,080
It is tricky because I was very excited about the interactive work category, but it has been nailed on for video games, and I was a bit hopeful that we might get some tabletop, and that is very abundantly not happening.

404
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,340
And I thought we might because of the nebula, but I don't think we will.

405
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,620
I think the right tabletop could still do it.

406
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,540
In the year where Daybreak didn't, I'm not sure anyone can.

407
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,760
Mm, that might be true for me.

408
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,040
But I mean it's early days, so we should just keep telling people about board games that we've played that we've really liked.

409
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,520
Yep.

410
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,840
But like having played a thousand times resist.

411
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,380
There were better board games than that published in 2024.

412
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,820
Good lord.

413
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,220
Uh that is on the It's not for podcast, is it?

414
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,820
Or maybe it is for podcast.

415
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:36,660
I mean, the story was really interesting, but the gameplay was hard to cope with.

416
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,980
I I did I did a little bit and then went, oh no.

417
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,600
I'm still playing Echoes of Wisdom.

418
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,640
That was cracking.

419
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:52,360
As far as I can tell, but like I think the 12th one down in 2025 might have been a board game.

420
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,419
But like the top ten were all video games.

421
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,340
So like I think it would need a lot of there are some being nominated, so I probably will.

422
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:02,340
Fate of the Fellowship is great, so so yeah, would recommend.

423
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,919
And I'm just being grumpy, like if it brings people joy.

424
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,279
Yeah, but it would bring you joy if the Fate of the Fellowship was on, right?

425
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,360
So let's see if we can bring John some joy.

426
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,799
Bring John some joy.

427
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,840
And Fate of the Fellowship is genuinely it is a really good game and it is really good.

428
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,200
Explicitly because of the genre aspects, I think.

429
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,760
Like the reason it is better than Base Pandemic is because of the conversation it is in with Lord of the Rings.

430
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,240
So

431
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:36,360
I very much enjoyed playing it because I got to be Gandalf and I biffed up a Balrog and came back as Gandalf the White.

432
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:36,919
It was great.

433
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,559
And then I never used my special Gandalf the White ability.

434
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,840
But recommend coming back as the White Wizard, it's good.

435
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,179
It's okay.

436
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:51,260
I mean Gandalf I feel like as a wizard is basically defined by the fact that he's a really powerful wizard who basically just sort of, you know, bumbles along a bit.

437
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,740
You don't see him do a lot of like massive big old fancy spells, but that's not his that's not what we love about Gandalf, is it?

438
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,220
We love the fact he gets high with Bilbo.

439
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,500
That's the best thing about him.

440
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:09,820
I am gonna say that the best game category last year, the top nominee had 29 votes, but the second nominee had 34 votes.

441
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,020
Nominations.

442
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,220
Nominations.

443
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:25,880
All I'm saying is that if like 30 of our listeners nomin play and nominate for either the fellowship, like obviously don't nominate it if you don't like it, but if you do like it, I reckon it's worth a nom.

444
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,760
So

445
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:33,200
But last year the only game that got on the top list was Wormspan, which got thirteen nominations.

446
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,360
So I reckon we could, you know

447
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,740
It would be good if there was a board game that got more than thirteen nominators.

448
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:46,260
You're definitely encouraging people to stuff the ballot at this point and I'm very, very edgy about it.

449
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm not.

450
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,940
If you like Fate of the Fellowship.

451
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,280
Please nominate it.

452
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,080
If you do not like it, please do not nominate it.

453
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:02,640
But I think if you are put off nominating board games because they never get on and therefore you think, oh there's no point nominate a board game, no one ever nominates board games.

454
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,300
From those stats you can see that actually it is a closer run thing than you might think.

455
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,780
Yeah.

456
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,860
And so if there is a board game you really like, nominate it.

457
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, that that I'm wholly I'm wholly down for that.

458
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,400
But you're not wholly down for if you like this particular board game, consider nomination.

459
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,600
No, I'm wholly down for that.

460
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,320
That is fine.

461
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,120
Okay, cool.

462
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,320
Cool cool cool

463
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,940
Um but what you were like you started off with, well if thirty-four of our listeners there's no way thirty-four of our listeners have played it.

464
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,260
And it's also possible that some of us have have

465
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,020
played it and bounced off it massively, which I know may just be me.

466
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,380
Everyone else might love it.

467
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,340
That's the thing.

468
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,140
And also remember that due to EPH

469
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:52,760
If you end up nominating things that you think are very little chance and they get knocked out early, then the number of points that you are giving to the remaining things on your ballot goes up.

470
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:01,920
So I like to think of it less as, oh, I am wasting my uh nominations on things that will never get on the ballot as, well, this has a chance

471
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:11,180
And if it doesn't, then the other three things that I think are have a really good chance of getting on the ballot will then get more points because I haven't had any nominations to get on the ballot yet

472
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,520
So that's my way of of thinking about how to balance it.

473
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,960
But I think also I would mention the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Ring trick-taking game.

474
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,160
I think that's okay.

475
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,560
I don't think it's as good as Fayette the Fellowship, but it is good.

476
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:34,440
So The Lord of the Rings is the trick-taking game, um, The Lord of the Rings Fate of the Fellowship, Galactic Cruise, which John has already mentioned, I think, FinSpan

477
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,940
Vantage, I have no knowledge of.

478
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,380
Vantage has been making waves.

479
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,740
It like every player has their own viewpoint.

480
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,260
You've landed on like a

481
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:54,600
alien planet and every player has their own viewpoint of what they can see and you have to try and work together but you don't all have the inform everyone has their own information.

482
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,639
It sounded intriguing.

483
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,760
Sharp and sit down bounced off it um and their interview uh their interview, their review.

484
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,320
is very interesting as a result.

485
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,000
Um but uh but yeah no it does look intriguing.

486
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:14,240
So some other games that I have played and or heard about.

487
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,179
um that I think might be worth a look, uh, that have been published in 2025.

488
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,820
Um so Take Time.

489
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,059
Uh Take Time is a game which is kind of like

490
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:34,580
The mind, you're playing cards next to clocks, and you've got to play the cards so that they go in ascending order.

491
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,679
But you're not allowed to talk while you're playing them.

492
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,280
You can sometimes play a card face up.

493
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,919
There are other rules like specific to each clock.

494
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,280
Uh and it's quite interesting.

495
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,919
Um, I like the way it works quite a lot.

496
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And I think it is genre, although the actual gameplay is um

497
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,220
Very abstract.

498
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,140
Uh Star Wars Battle of Hoth.

499
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:57,660
If you've played Memoir 44 and you were like, well this is all very well, but where are the 8080s or the Atat's?

500
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:03,580
Depending on whether you're a man called Andrew who have strong opinions on how I pronounce uh initialisms

501
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,020
Uh it's very good.

502
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,740
It's very, very good.

503
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,220
Played it at the UK Games Expo and thoroughly enjoyed it.

504
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:16,780
Um The Old King's Crown is on my want to playlist um but has been making massive waves and I I think that would be

505
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,400
Something to look at maybe nominating for a Hugo Award if it's any good.

506
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,800
But like a lot of people have really loved it.

507
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,960
And then finally, I'm gonna suggest Star Trek Captain's Chair, which is really good.

508
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,560
It's like a deck.

509
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:40,740
based card game you sort of build uh it's hard to describe I think it's probably best solo but it also does do two players

510
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:44,139
Um, but I played it with my friend Josh and it was really, really good.

511
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:51,419
So those are some other board games that I might say are worth having a look at when it comes time for you to fill in your nominating form.

512
00:30:51,460 --> 00:31:03,060
Star Trek Captain's Care Chair was already on the Hugo spreadsheet of Doom, so Maybe we should leave the rest of the categories and we'll do a few more categories next time.

513
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,539
I think I have a views on series or reviews on related work, etc.

514
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
I might have read some novellas by them

515
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,639
Talking about other aspects of LA Con and also Liz's credit card company.

516
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:23,679
Yes.

517
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:24,559
Yay.

518
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,440
So

519
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:38,360
I think I mentioned a few episodes ago that I was literally buying a membership, a virtual membership to LA while we're on the pod, and then I would have it done well in time for the 31st of January deadline.

520
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,100
Um and what actually happened is my credit card company then said, Oh, that payment didn't go through and I went, Oh, fine, I will do it again.

521
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,660
And then I had two LECOR memberships.

522
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,680
Yay!

523
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,360
So thank you to Elecon who have allowed me to transfer one of the memberships to someone else.

524
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,240
But it does raise the interesting point in that for a while I had two memberships.

525
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:06,720
that in theory we were both Wisfers memberships and therefore I guess a strict interpretation of the Constitution is that I should not have been allowed to transfer them.

526
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,720
On the other hand, if I didn't, then I've like got two LA Con memberships and

527
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,800
I only want one and I don't need two under one name and it doesn't I don't can't exercise the whispers rights of the second one.

528
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,480
And also you're not allowed to have two Wispus memberships, right?

529
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,320
That is also not allowed, I believe.

530
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,320
Let me check the constitution.

531
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:35,399
Maybe maybe in if it's not explicitly banned, does that mean we can all just like that that opens the door to massive ballot stuffing, so they should probably ban it if it's not allowed.

532
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:44,420
Now I'm gonna suggest that you you're allowed to have you're allowed to have multiple memberships, but you're only allowed to vote exercise the voting rights on one of them.

533
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,960
I don't know to the Liz bat.

534
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,160
I think basically they are you know, there's a common sense interpretation which is you can only

535
00:32:52,620 --> 00:33:00,060
You should only be able to if you have multiple ones, then you and you did it by accident, you should be able to give one away to someone else and also that.

536
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,720
You should only be able to vote with one of them.

537
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,960
But I did not keep them and test this out.

538
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,160
Probably someone would have noticed if I tried to vote twice in site selection.

539
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,800
Yeah.

540
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,920
I mean I think it would have annoyed the Hugo administrator.

541
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,360
Yes.

542
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,160
And we don't want to do that.

543
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,440
Nope, because they both know where I live.

544
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,640
Yeah.

545
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,400
And she will come for you.

546
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,360
Yes.

547
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:34,060
Um but I I did briefly expose a kind of annoying loophole in that if they were being very strict about it, they could have said, Nope, you accidentally bought two, they're non-transferable, tough.

548
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,660
Uh fortunately they didn't.

549
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,140
And it wouldn't have been the end of the world, but it would have been quite annoying.

550
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,780
Mm-hmm.

551
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,340
And it turns out you didn't need to buy any.

552
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:41,980
No.

553
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,620
No, it turns out because I'm El Icon staff and they have a staff rate, I could have just bought a supporting membership.

554
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,899
But too late.

555
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:50,700
I did it.

556
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,019
So it's a bit of a fiasco all round.

557
00:33:53,179 --> 00:34:00,620
But the good thing is that I both bought two memberships and managed to transfer one to another person before the 31st of

558
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:12,640
January, thus avoiding the constitutional issue of what if I had bought a membership, say on the thirtieth of January, and then transferred it to a different name on the first of February, after the deadline for

559
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,720
Uh try for having a membership in order to nominate in the Hugo Awards.

560
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,760
Now that would have been an interesting uh kind of worms.

561
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,760
That would have been a proper conundrum.

562
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,640
Um I'm glad that didn't happen, Liz.

563
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,040
No, it's not.

564
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,160
That's uncomplicated.

565
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,380
I I hadn't even really considered that, but the person I transferred my membership to did point that out.

566
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,940
Um I let them remain anonymous, but thank you.

567
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,700
So it sounds like you can't have two memberships, but LA Con did the sensible thing and sorted it out for you.

568
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:44,760
Yes, Elecon did the entirely sensible thing and sort it out, but I guess there is a s very strict constitutional interpretation in which they should not have done that.

569
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,040
Mm-hmm.

570
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:53,720
In general I don't mind WorldCons ignoring the Worcester Constitution when the Worcester Constitution is not cle uh not fit for purpose, but it does beg the question.

571
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:47,720
Yes,

572
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:05,079
Maybe it is uh quixotic of me to think that the Worcester Constitution could ever accurately reflect all of the things it needs to reflect to be strictly obeyed at all times.

573
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:15,040
Probably doesn't need I mean I'd probably rather this could be like left up to Conn's like sensible interpretation of things, but that's not what we do in in in all circumstances, so No

574
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,140
I think in general I'd rather wait for Oh, it's tricky, isn't it?

575
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,580
You wanna head off you wanna head off plausible routes for abuse, but you also don't want to

576
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,320
massively overengineer things by inventing massively implausible routes for abuse.

577
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,760
And also if you think your credit card company has declined your LA Con payment, maybe wait a couple of days and see if it really did.

578
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:48,500
So so staff can have a free virtual membership and if you are attending, I believe the staff attending membership is a hundred dollars.

579
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:56,640
So for those who don't We probably shouldn't mention all the rates and stuff because I think they normally keep this quite like within the staff.

580
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,240
So to stop people trying to sign up for staff places to get cheaper memberships.

581
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,300
I don't think they usually do it.

582
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,620
Oh the a lot of the w American ones do.

583
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,260
Uh I think Seattle had one, Chicon had one.

584
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,580
I paid I paid full whack for Seattle.

585
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,620
I don't think Seattle did.

586
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,260
I think that's why they had the reimbursement policy.

587
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,380
I think most American World Cons do it by waiting to see if they do have a surplus and then doing reimbursements.

588
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,140
But if it's true that most American World Cons do this, we should probably say that out loud, because if that's true, I did not know it.

589
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,720
And I might have overpaid for my memberships in the past.

590
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:32,440
There is a fine line between keeping it shum to avoid abuse and not actually telling enough people that

591
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,359
the people who need to know about it know about it, if that makes sense.

592
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,640
A and keeping it stummed so that your non US staff and volunteers don't know about it.

593
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:51,820
I don't think there's any I think just because it's a no a more regular thing of US World Cons rather than UK ones doesn't mean that we are necessarily keeping it under our hats.

594
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,240
No, I'm sure it's not deliberate.

595
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,160
Sorry, I wasn't suggesting it was deliberate.

596
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,040
I was just suggesting that it's a way of um it's an it's an unacknowledged bias.

597
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,280
I don't know if I think that's true.

598
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,880
What makes you say that?

599
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,960
Maybe I'm just not in the right circles as as Paul was suggesting.

600
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,480
Well, but I think this is the first time a convention's done it.

601
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,920
I might be wrong.

602
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,600
Listeners write in.

603
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:24,940
Because I'd be interested to know if I am wrong, but my perception was previously that US World Cons gave you a reimbursement if they made a profit, but you paid the same if you were staff as everyone else.

604
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:34,500
I assumed that what LACON we're moving to was a model where you pay less for your membership if you're staff, but they don't I'm assuming I will not get reimbursement therefore.

605
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,220
But if anyone knows, please write in.

606
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:51,180
'Cause I was gonna say I think this is a good idea if you are sure enough in your budget because it means that for people with people who are volunteering for you who have lower incomes, they don't have to basically lend you the money you're gonna give them back anyway.

607
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:54,740
And that is good for anyone who, you know, has more trouble with money.

608
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,299
Um so I think this is generally a good thing.

609
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,900
Um, but i if it if it turns out it's a thing that's happened at

610
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:07,859
US Worldcon since I've been in fandom and I've just been massively overpaying for my memberships that whole time, my opinion on the next episode will be significantly grumpier.

611
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,579
So let's let's see whether people write as locks

612
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:17,780
So Seattle just said you can have the reduced rate if you know they had an out reduced rate and said it was appropriate for anyone who would be cost constrained, including staff.

613
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,780
So Yeah, I mean that's fair.

614
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,940
But I'm not it I was not cost constrained, so I wouldn't have bought that one.

615
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:32,140
Yeah, and I think the idea is that, you know, for LA Con they do have reduced price staff memberships, but there's nothing stopping you buying a full price one

616
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,099
If you don't feel cost constraint, it's just a different way of communicating it.

617
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,339
But that's not the same as but that's not no, they're compl no, that it's not.

618
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,779
They're completely different things.

619
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,500
If LA Con says staff pay a hundred dollars, I will pay a hundred dollars.

620
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:49,420
If LA Con say if you can't afford a full membership, you may pay a hundred dollars, that is a very different sentence.

621
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,400
So I think those are two completely different paradigms, in fact.

622
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,839
I think this is a new one.

623
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,880
I guess so, but I I am pretty sure that there have been staph rates for all cons before.

624
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,779
Yeah, I mean I if if there have been that is very interesting.

625
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,859
I just haven't joined enough to know.

626
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,859
But also if people know, please write in because I would love to know

627
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,120
whether that's true and if it's true which worldcons had that rate and how common this is.

628
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,680
Because that as as it stands, I did not know any of that.

629
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,520
And I suspect the same will therefore be true of at least some of our listeners.

630
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:25,880
Cause I assumed that's why you joined twice w without realizing that you didn't need to because it was new and shiny and etc.

631
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,559
I would not have realized I didn't need to buy a full membership if I hadn't seen it.

632
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,240
I mean I still need to buy I still need to buy a supporting membership, right?

633
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,800
It's not a completely free virtual membership, it's a free upgrade.

634
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,200
I always have a supporting membership already, so

635
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,620
No, I bought it 'cause I was buying it for the Hugo deadline.

636
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,100
Ah.

637
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,780
So I bought it in January.

638
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,500
I voted in site selection at twenty four.

639
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,860
Yeah, I didn't cause

640
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,320
It was only one bid, so I didn't bother.

641
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,280
I yeah.

642
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,280
No, I I do always vote inside selection, so that's another thing.

643
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,400
Uh right.

644
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,700
So we're going to move on to a segment on the fan funds.

645
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:14,540
The fan funds are the funds which uh allow fans to go and visit conventions on a

646
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,380
in a different country or different continent than where they are from.

647
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:23,660
And so there's TAF, the Transatlantic Fan Fund, which sends fans between Europe and North America.

648
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,700
There's GUF, the Get Up and Under Fund Fund, which sends fans between Australia and Europe.

649
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:35,880
And there's F, the European Fan Fund, which uh is a bit different to the other two in that it kind of sends European fans around Europe.

650
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,240
But they're all having races this year and they're at different stages, so let's go through

651
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,980
where they're up to and who you can vote for, which ones you can uh still nominate yourself for and so on.

652
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,860
Yeah.

653
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,100
So on last

654
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:59,700
week's episode we uh discussed that we were waiting impatiently for the tough ballot to come out and that we knew that Kat Templeton would be one of the candidates.

655
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,420
And now we can say that the Taft ballot is out, and Kat Templeton is one of the candidates.

656
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:12,260
The other one is Lisa Hertel, and they are campaigning to visit Metropolcon in Berlin this summer.

657
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,460
And as usual, you can go and vote.

658
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,180
Uh this podcast is supporting Cat Templeton.

659
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,360
'Cause we know Kat and John, I believe, had pizza with Kat.

660
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,080
Yes.

661
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,280
And Chris Garcia?

662
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,680
And Chris Garcia, and I believe James Bacon.

663
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,160
Mm.

664
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,160
I think it was us four.

665
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,540
Uh Pizza Buffet.

666
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,380
I believe I ate too much pizza.

667
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,500
That just seems likely.

668
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,980
I think Linda Wenzelberger might have been there too.

669
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,780
It was good.

670
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,420
There you go.

671
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,380
Yeah, pizza.

672
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,980
I'm just going to uh say who's nominated everyone this time.

673
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:55,180
So Lisa has been nominated by Carolina Gomez-Lagolov, Liz Zito, Diana Thayer and Teddy Harvier, Pierre and Sandy Pettinger, and Jill and Don Eastlake

674
00:41:55,059 --> 00:42:02,500
And Kat has been nominated by Sandra Bond, Graeme Charnock, Nick Ferry, John Purcell, Lloyd Penny.

675
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:09,299
Um as well as the TAF race, there will also be a guff race taking somebody from the UK or Europe to

676
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:16,380
Um, SwanCon, which is SwanCon 50, which is the Australian naf Natcon in Perth, Australia.

677
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,340
By the time you get this podcast, which is not for ten days from when we record or eleven days

678
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:27,300
We will almost certainly have a race going and um so we already have two candidates.

679
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,540
Um I I think it's gonna be fine.

680
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,740
So I'm going to be encouraging you all to vote.

681
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:37,900
Um this podcast is going to be studiously neutral on the matter of GUF because I'm the North North Side administrator.

682
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,700
Hmm.

683
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,800
That does seem quite reasonable.

684
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:50,720
I am so looking forward to this race being over, the race the the the trip being over for the winner and no longer being guff administrator because I am done with it's fine, it's fine.

685
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,080
You got a right to report.

686
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,880
Yeah.

687
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,700
Mm, yeah, true.

688
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,180
Mm.

689
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:59,900
I can't write as well as not being able to read books, I also can't write at the moment, but you know, might happen.

690
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,660
What we did with what what they did with Tobes is they locked him in a room and asked him questions until they had a report.

691
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,619
So, you know

692
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,180
Yeah, I mean I have thous I have hundreds of thousands of words, that's not the issue.

693
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,900
They just don't make any sense and they're not in the right order.

694
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,180
Uh that's fair.

695
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,740
And I have unrealisticly unre realistic standards and procrastination issues.

696
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,780
And then F.

697
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:20,820
What's F?

698
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:21,580
F.

699
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,020
Taff guff and F.

700
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,300
You said you wanted to do F.

701
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,260
Yeah, but.

702
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,580
But atats are ratats, right?

703
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,820
I got in trouble for rot 13.

704
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,520
Which I've always pronounced R O T.

705
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,560
Oh Rot thirteen is Rot thirteen at one hundred percent.

706
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,200
Just seems just sounds silly in my head.

707
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,720
And GIF is GIF.

708
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,940
Can we get on with the podcast?

709
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,460
What do we know about F?

710
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,099
Hang on.

711
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:44,300
We have a race?

712
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:51,020
Yeah, you could if you're interested in attending Metropolcon, um nominations are still open for EFF

713
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:58,760
They close on March fifteenth, so you can apply um now if you'd like to go to MetropolCon.

714
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,760
Um and there's the full i information is here and I will put that link in the show notes.

715
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:12,799
All right, who would like to pick first?

716
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,119
I guess I can pick first.

717
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,000
Liz, you can pick first.

718
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,160
It's interesting, isn't it, that we don't go John Alice and Liz for picks.

719
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,920
I I think we were going to and then you wanted to pick last for some reason.

720
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:35,040
Basically, I haven't read a book I want to nominate because I'm in the middle of some other books, so I'm going to nominate a TV show that I have been enjoying, uh, slightly surprisingly so

721
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:39,940
Because it is a Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, which is in the Game of Thrones universe.

722
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:42,980
It's based on a series of novellas by George R.

723
00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:45,539
Martin, the Dunkin' Egg novellas.

724
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,800
which are about Sir Duncan the Tall, a Hedge Knight and his squire Egg.

725
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,400
I've read I think I've read all the novellas and enjoyed them

726
00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:02,740
And they are re the first one is reasonably faithful to the first series, or rather the series is reasonably faithful to the novella, which I quite enjoyed.

727
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:12,120
Um, but having kind of gone off Game of Thrones a bit at the end like everyone else and haven't got into House the Dragon, I did like this because it feels like they're going a bit back to

728
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:19,940
what I kind of enjoyed about Game of Thrones in the first place, which is that it is about Duncan who is a hedge knight.

729
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,980
So he has no money, no titles, no land.

730
00:45:24,299 --> 00:45:30,940
He's just Sir Duncan and he wants to be a great knight and is kind of figuring out how to do it

731
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:41,859
and his uh squire egg, uh a boy he picks up in a tavern along the way, and there's obviously some more to his backstory, but you will figure it out.

732
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,320
Uh if you watch series.

733
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,160
And I think what is enjoyable about it is that they've I think the casting is very good.

734
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,040
And so Duncan is he's sort of just straightforward.

735
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,120
He's like a big sort of farm lad who just comes in

736
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,320
and, you know, in some ways blunders his way through.

737
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:07,960
But because he's so kind of honest and earnest and someone that you want to root for, you enjoy watching him do it and you enjoy kind of him picking up support from the people he talks to.

738
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:18,140
kind of a lot of the knights and lords of the land, who just seem to also recognise him for being like a big, strong guy who would just like to try and do

739
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,640
something good about in his kind of own idea of what knighthood should be.

740
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,040
Um yeah, so it's it's enjoyable.

741
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:27,560
The episodes are quite short.

742
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,960
It's gonna be eight episodes when it's

743
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:34,180
finished and we've had the first four, so it could stuff it up at the end, but I think it's gonna make it.

744
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:43,540
And yeah, it feels a bit like they have got rid of some of the kind of vast weight of lore and intrigue and so on that is surrounding the other shows and

745
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,799
gone back to basics a bit, although with a giant budget so they can have massive jousting scenes and so on.

746
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,640
And I am enjoying it so far.

747
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,579
Yes, I read interesting things about it.

748
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:59,220
Uh apparently they're not allowed to talk about a knight's tale in the writer's room.

749
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:13,060
And apparently there is a very firm sense that because the book was written two years before that film came out, they they're first and it was what copied them.

750
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,260
And I'm like, ooh.

751
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:18,920
If you said it's a bit like Game of Thrones Knight's Tale, I'd be like, I liked Knight's Tale.

752
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,920
Um, so yeah, that made me interested in watching it, because that's a Kraken film.

753
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,180
It is, and I hadn't really thought of it like that.

754
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:36,420
Just because I mean it is sometimes it is quite funny, but I think like tonally it is still like in the Game of Thrones universe and there's only so light you can really get

755
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,940
in this terrible setting.

756
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,540
That's fair.

757
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,140
I am going to pick Murderbot, which is an Apple TV show.

758
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:53,760
So it stars Alexander Skarsgaard as the titular Murderbot, and it's based on the books by Martha Wells.

759
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,600
And it was just it was very lovely.

760
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,240
Like, I just wanted to keep watching it and then when it was over, I was like, oh, I don't like that it's over.

761
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,400
I would quite like it not to be over, please.

762
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,440
I think they're making a second series for you.

763
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,800
Yes, they are.

764
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,060
But yeah, no, I just really liked it.

765
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,020
It was quite funny.

766
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:16,220
Um the episodes were short, it was well executed, and I I just thought it was really nice.

767
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,980
And it was kinda nice to see

768
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:28,800
I suspected I would like this, especially based on the books, but it was nice to see like someone on screen who is having the same or some of the same internal thought processes as I have when I am navigating my life.

769
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:35,980
And you know, it's been out for a while, it's not particularly new, but we um we uh we finished something else so we watched it and we tore through it.

770
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,380
Um 'cause it's only ten episodes.

771
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,900
They're quite short as well.

772
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:40,940
It's not

773
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:41,880
uh not long.

774
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,520
Um we watched two of them and then have not been inclined to pick it up again.

775
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,720
But people you know, it probably uh be feature on people's Hugo Ballots.

776
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,000
Um people seem to like it a lot, so and I've been recommended it by multiple people.

777
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:00,099
Oh, I I was I was gonna say something else very quickly, sorry.

778
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,940
Um which is on the topic of Apple TV, um Apple have bought Severance.

779
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:16,620
So whereas before they were like placing orders from a company that were making severance um on a season-by-season basis, they have now bought the actual IP itself.

780
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,540
um and control it outright and they have renewed it for two more seasons.

781
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:25,820
So that is good because I like Severance and I'm kinda hoping that

782
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,720
Well season two, I think, was as good as season mm, maybe not as good as, but still very, very, very, very good.

783
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,120
And so, um, yeah, I'm excited to see what season three holds

784
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:45,920
I think this is very good for another reason, which is that and I think the seventh uh team have even said this, that it took a very long time to make series two.

785
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:46,660
Mm-hmm.

786
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:53,540
And possibly if they can plan for three and four at the same time, it might mean there's less of a giant break between seasons.

787
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,580
And this is like increasingly a thing for Prestige TV, isn't it?

788
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,940
That you get a season and then you wait three years for the next one.

789
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,280
Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense.

790
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,880
Yeah, so it makes a lot of sense now.

791
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,880
It's why you're getting early renewals for everything, like they're already making, I think, a knight of the seven kingdoms season two.

792
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,119
Um what they do when they get to like season four and they've run out of novellas?

793
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,560
Well that's a good question, isn't it?

794
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,720
Um would Georgia have written more by them?

795
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,920
Mm, yes, obviously.

796
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,280
So so I don't

797
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,580
really have a pick this week.

798
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,180
We've watched some more of the expanse.

799
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:31,620
I've played some more of UFO 50, including, I can say UFO 50 has fifty games in it, and I've played a couple of games I had not previously played, which are Warp Tank and

800
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,400
Avianos.

801
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:37,760
Warp tank is a a game where you have a tank that warps.

802
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,840
I'm taking a leaf out of John's book.

803
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:44,260
Um it's a little bit like V V V V V V if you've played that, but less frenetic.

804
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:48,500
At least it's less frenetic on my tiny little retro console that's maybe a bit slow.

805
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,859
And Avianos is a forex where um the mammals destroyed

806
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,400
society and the birds took over in the future and you are now.

807
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,040
Um a bird kingdom trying to beat up other bird kingdoms

808
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:11,140
And they're they're both great and I've been to see multiple things including a fantastic new folk band called Saol who are five

809
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:17,180
um fit women who sing songs and play fiddles and they work great.

810
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,580
And a show called Inala, which is um

811
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,500
kind of high energy Zulu music.

812
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,099
Um and that was really, really good.

813
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,339
And none of those are really picks, but there we go.

814
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,260
Uh because none of them are genre

815
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,340
Um, except UFO fifty, because that's um always genre.

816
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,820
Um, but I will come back next week.

817
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,660
Next time I'll pick Hades 2.

818
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,380
How's that?

819
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
But I can't pick it till I start playing it.

820
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,720
V is great.

821
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,480
I know that wasn't one of the many things you didn't pick, but it is.

822
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:50,240
V V V V V V.

823
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:51,760
It is pronounced V.

824
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,359
Oh yeah, no right.

825
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,880
Are you sure about that?

826
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,880
Yes, according to developer it's pronounced V, but it is f six Vs.

827
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,280
Um but I got all of the I fully completed that game

828
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:09,720
when I was uh an undergrad and I was absolutely obsessed with it and I absolutely adore that game.

829
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,400
Um one of my favorite games.

830
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:14,279
I have not played or interacted with any of the other things you mentioned.

831
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,720
Oh except the expanse

832
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,280
But listeners long time listeners will already know that I've watched the Expanse.

833
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,920
Um Well I enjoy that Alison went, I don't really have a pick and then proceed to pick uh

834
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,000
Five different things?

835
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,560
No, I just told you what I was doing this I've been doing this week.

836
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,839
It's just not quite the same.

837
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,839
You're picking life itself.

838
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,880
My kid doesn't like um

839
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:40,100
warp tank because they say V V V V V V V did everything much better.

840
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,740
Oh, hang on, it's good to know that your progeny uh takes after you.

841
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,400
Um, in what way?

842
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,840
Uh well it's not as good as this other thing that did it a lot better back when.

843
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,480
Yeah.

844
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:59,600
So V V V V V V V is essentially a precision platformer and Warp Tank is basically a puzzle game with a little bit of precision platforming in it.

845
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:00,039
Does fair.

846
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:03,880
Oh and it's got fantastic music as as does everything in UFO fifty.

847
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,319
I mean maybe I should pick the UFO fifty soundtrack, which is

848
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:14,660
Unbelievably good by Eric Sucker, who is a pretty well known Are UFO 50s on switch now?

849
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,180
That's interesting.

850
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:16,900
Yes it is.

851
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:17,540
Yes it is.

852
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,020
Do that.

853
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,740
Do that do that.

854
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,660
I might buy it on Switch as well.

855
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,540
And that was the Octathought Podcast.

856
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,140
And it's goodbye for me.

857
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,900
It's goodbye from me.

858
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,580
It's goodbye for me.

859
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,820
Yes, no.

860
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,540
Good luck to uh Cat Antalisa.

861
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,700
Um the winner will be going somewhere.

862
00:53:54,859 --> 00:53:56,220
Where will the winner be going, Alison?

863
00:53:56,619 --> 00:53:58,460
Um the winner's going to MetropolCon.

864
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,900
I think Liz already said that.

865
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,660
I did already say that, John.

866
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:08,460
I'm pleased you have moved into not paying attention to me after some not paying attention to Allison.

867
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,299
Hundred and fifty-four episodes.

868
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,500
We're very used to everyone not paying attention to each other except for Liz, who pays attention to everyone.

869
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,480
I was finding links for the show notes and I temporarily stopped paying attention.

870
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:20,800
Yeah.

871
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,440
That's something about attention deficit.

872
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:26,200
At least I'm not just like, you know, look it up.

873
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:27,880
At least I'm not just internet shopping.

874
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,640
I am doing podcast things.

875
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,799
Yeah, don't buy don't buy like convention memberships while on the pod because, you know, it's gonna go wrong.

876
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,960
I didn't mean I didn't mean to shame you for that with that statement, but um but yes, fair.

877
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,320
It's fair, it's fair.

878
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:50,020

Beep.
