1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,440
I mean I was I was being uh a little subtextual.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,440
Metatextual dinosaurs, Liz.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,040
That's a reference I don't get, which means it's probably not from the nineties.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,840
It's from a podcast called Octothorpe.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:33,900
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 150th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,580
which is hearing a meow on the radio and going back for the cat on the eighteenth of december twenty twenty five.

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,860
I'm John Coxon.

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,020
I'm Alison Scott.

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,800
And I'm Liz Batty.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,460
And we have

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
Some letters of comment in this, the last episode of 2025.

12
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,079
Yeah, we're taking a week off over Christmas.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,920
Happy Christmas, listeners!

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
Or whatever holiday you celebrate.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,900
Or if you don't celebrate a holiday at all, bar humbug.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,340
For the sheep out there.

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,900
It's funny 'cause sheep go bar.

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,860
You know, we've done this for 150 episodes and yet I still am surprised sometimes.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,740
Yay!

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,540
Good.

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,340
Alright, we have some letters of comment and the first one we're gonna read out is from Frederick Coulter.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,100
uh who wrote to us to say if Denmark ever wins a WorldCon, the Hugo Base can be a pile of Lego and instructions.

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,660
This should make the shipping issue less of a problem.

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,520
Now this is a genuinely great idea.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:38,799
Um if anyone from Lego is listening, uh I think at the time of writing the uh the the LA uh base design contest is still open, so there's still time.

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,040
No, no, no.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,960
Um, if anyone from Denmark is listening, you know what you have to do.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,120
I mean you you could do the entire WorldCom bit for a bit.

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,180
Of Lego.

30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,060
Yes.

31
00:01:50,300 --> 00:02:01,020
Frederick also says, in Seattle there was a booth for Czech science fiction that were making a noise about uh Czechia WorldCombid, um, and we're gonna talk about that a little bit later in the episode.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,960
Nicholas White wrote to us and said, I definitely remember math mo as a word current in Cambridge when I was there, nineteen eighty-six to nineteen ninety-one.

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
So I was there from nineteen eighty-three to nineteen eighty-six, so ether

34
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,280
It appeared sometime just after that or I wasn't paying attention.

35
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,519
Um Answers on a postcard

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,800
So in in the show notes listeners, originally when I wrote this email, I put a sub bullet which was Was Alison just not paying attention?

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,120
And then I deleted it because I was like, That might be mean.

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,040
But I'm glad that Alison made the same joke.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,400
Yeah, there we go.

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:33,960
And

41
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,660
And Nicholas also says, I am very happy to show you round my favorite drinking places in Brussels and Leuven in particular.

42
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,300
So um yeah, Nicholas, we might take you up on that.

43
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,500
Well, as as you know from the photo, I have in fact visited Nicholas uh inn Belgium.

44
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,940
Although due to my time constraints we did not have a beer.

45
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,420
We went to watch a charity fun run.

46
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,140
We also heard from Christopher Jay Garcia who has three thoughts.

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:08,180
Unsurprisingly, he has already seen The Blood of Heroes, which is the film from which Jugger the game is, and apparently there's a documentary called I Am Jugger.

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,520
um about it.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,200
So well done Chris.

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,040
You are as usual like twenty-five years ahead of everyone else.

51
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,040
Um he says he is all for Nuremberg WorldCon, although he'll have to say he'll vote for Brisbane.

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,000
Unless Geelong is down on the footy ladder behind the bears come voting time.

53
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,200
I believe this is an Aussie rules football reference.

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,600
Um if we've got that wrong, Chris, please write in.

55
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,900
Yeah, he says The Truman Show is one of the saddest films ever made.

56
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,260
He also thinks Cypher made the right choice in The Matrix, so you know, judge Chris's Chris's thoughts

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:38,980
appropriately.

58
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:50,100
I mean yeah, I mean mmm I don't think you're supposed to think Cypher made the right choice of the Matrix, Chris, but I respect your attitude to art.

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,800
Which I describe as chaotic.

60
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,400
Which of Chris's attitudes would you not describe as chaotic?

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,360
Uh okay, no, yeah, that's uh that's a great question, Liz.

62
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,040
I have no good answer

63
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,900
I'm sure Chris does and he will write in.

64
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,299
We also heard from Rosanna Pendlebury, who would like to agree with John about recognition for primarily critical folks.

65
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:10,780
Um

66
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,260
And say that also conventions don't seem to put on that much content on critical topics.

67
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:23,500
Uh there yeah, I think I agree there is an occasional tendency to just have a panel which is like, let's talk about criticism and maybe we need to dig a little bit deeper.

68
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,900
But I think it is also sometimes hard to find the appropriate people to pot on them if they don't kind of explicitly say, I would like to talk about all these different criticism things.

69
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:37,620
So make sure you put that in your forms, people who are uh writing uh panel participant forms.

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:46,840
I think it's also because authors tend to definitely always fill them in with loads of stuff because it's, you know, the best way of promoting themselves and their work.

71
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,120
in a nice way at conventions and possibly all the criticism folks don't feel the need to do that.

72
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,600
I will also say I think different conventions are different on this

73
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:06,540
I think Neil and Nick did programme for ManCunicon in 2016 and I I imagine that program was chocker block with critical content.

74
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:15,160
Th is there a distinction between panels which are about thinking critically about things and panels about the art of criticism?

75
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,960
Yes.

76
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:24,180
That that that was the point I was going to make, that we actually have lots of stuff that's about thinking critically about the matter of science fiction and fantasy.

77
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,620
Also, Rosanna, we all check the emails, but I am one of the people who's checking them.

78
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,900
Ha ha ha ha ha.

79
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,580
Ha ha ha You're just not going to explain to listeners at all.

80
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,220
Fair enough.

81
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:35,620
No.

82
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,220
I respect that decision.

83
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,180
We also heard from Paul Wiemer, who also loves the Truman Show.

84
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,820
There's lots of love for the Truman show uh out there.

85
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:45,220
And yeah, I think everyone basically

86
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:54,900
It's really interesting because uh Paul has written to us about how hard the Truman Show hits because he just wants to have adventures and explore and is kind of, you know, thwarted at every turn.

87
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,259
And Chris wrote to us saying how like the Truman Show is one of the saddest

88
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,220
Saddest films ever made.

89
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,500
He is the center of the universe he lives in and convinced it to give it all up.

90
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,660
I think it's fascinating how like they have two slightly different takes on one good very good film, but it hits them both very hard.

91
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,140
So

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,600
Yep.

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,640
Thank you for writing.

94
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,920
We heard from Tammy Coxon, who enjoyed our SmothCon speculation episode.

95
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:25,340
She especially loved the bit where the th about all the things the Pog could go through between now and twenty thirty four, and she said, On with the fight, please.

96
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,940
Let's get that out of the way.

97
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,220
So we haven't had a big dust up for a while, have we, chaps?

98
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,820
Um no.

99
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:42,139
No, well although I I should say that that Alison was a little bit late today, thus increasing the likelihood that we will run over into my dinner hour and I will get cranky and that is probably how the fight starts.

100
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,460
Twenty-seven minutes late.

101
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,139
So sorry.

102
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,300
I missed multiple alarms and messages.

103
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,340
And then finally, Ivan Sinner wrote in uh with

104
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,420
Other thoughts on our giant bus stop?

105
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:08,620
He loves the idea in twenty thirty four of Okthorpe Live being like a Fleetwood Mac concert with each of us turning up with minders demanding separate green rooms and the show itself the perfect mix of funny and informative podcasting.

106
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,620
And simmering snide personal hatred.

107
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
So yeah.

108
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,740
You should see my rider.

109
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,659
Thanks for writing it, Ivan.

110
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,860
That made me chuckle.

111
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,220
That was letters of comment.

112
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,500
Thank you very much, everyone.

113
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,040
On previous episodes, we have covered Chris Barkley's quest to actually get an undamaged 2023 Hugo Award.

114
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:46,360
Which, as you recall, they were all presented at Chengdu, but then many of them were uh damaged in shipping and then not sent out by Dave, and then Chris tried to sue Dave in order to get

115
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,099
Here's Hugo.

116
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:53,740
And then basically it seems like the Chengdu WolCon's American arm took over and said, Yeah, we will sort this out.

117
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,340
And they have in fact now just sent Chris a trophy by UPS.

118
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,539
And there's a great picture of it on file seven seventy which we will link to.

119
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:08,300
It's got vibes of that picture of uh Timothy Dalton from Hot Fuzz, where he's standing next to a photo of himself.

120
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,780
And it's a picture of Chris with his intact go standing next to a photo of himself with his in-tactu go.

121
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,580
Uh, it's great.

122
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,580
Presumably not the same Hugo, which would make me a bit sad, but there we go.

123
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,180
Um Ooh, it's the ship of Theseus, isn't it

124
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Mmm.

125
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,120
I think I'd rather have an I'd rather have an intact Hugo than the broken one.

126
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,400
The one that I held on stage was beautiful and then it broke, I think.

127
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,380
Also, do we know, like, if they all got shipped to a central point and then handed out?

128
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,940
I guess of Chris we do know because there's only one, but if you were a multi, a multi a multi

129
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:47,260
a person podcast collective and there were three identical Hugos, do you end up with the same Hugo?

130
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,820
Ooh.

131
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,540
I actually secretly switched your Hugos with each other under the table.

132
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:06,959
Every SmofCon there is a QA session, and various future bids for Smothcons and WorldCons stand up.

133
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,440
and give presentations and then people can ask questions.

134
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:17,440
And so the SmothCon next year will be SmothCon 43, which will be in Lisbon and is being run by Esther McCullum Stewart.

135
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,520
So keep an eye out for that, listeners.

136
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,640
And then the two seated worldcons uh stood up and gave presentations.

137
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
LA Con 5.

138
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,840
Which is going to be in Los Angeles next year.

139
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,720
And that was very competently done and flowed very well and didn't get very many questions.

140
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Then Montreal in Canada.

141
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:44,660
uh who did rather less good uh job at presenting and had quite a lot more questions, I think it's fair to say

142
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,160
And we didn't really learn anything new.

143
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,120
They know they need a better website, but they haven't done one yet.

144
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
And they're gonna put they want to make everything very accessible, so they're gonna put PDFs on the internet.

145
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:00,140
So I had to put my hand up and be like, no, no, please do also accessible things, not just PDFs, thank you.

146
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,660
Uh, because I don't want Emily and Andrew to have to be the only ones that say that.

147
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,100
uh it's important that us youngsters uh club together to be grumpy.

148
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:14,700
But yeah, so they were mostly stuff that we had already heard and there wasn't much, I don't think, surprising in either presentation.

149
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,500
Do you have any questions about that, Alison and Liz?

150
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:24,200
I I I would what can we do to help Montreal get its act together without actually doing any work?

151
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,280
It is really tricky, isn't it?

152
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,160
I don't know.

153
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,320
How can we influence

154
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,100
Well I'm not I mean I'm not sure it can.

155
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:43,980
I think they've got the message that the thing they need to do is have a website, but short of someone volunteering to make the website and sort out whatever is are the other things blocking it, there's not really a lot we can do from afar.

156
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:55,100
I think we can do things like I think they put out a they put out some communication with prices this week that had um some issues in it and I think people did basically quickly point out

157
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,720
Or you probably want to fix that table, it's got some errors in or whatever.

158
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,280
And I think that's quite useful if you can kind of gently do it early on before it propagates.

159
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,560
But on the other hand

160
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:12,500
I un really there should be someone in the organization double and triple checking things like how much it costs to go to a convention is correct in your newsletters before you before you do it.

161
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,140
So

162
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,959
I I don't know.

163
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,839
That's fair.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,519
I think the problem is that if you run your beard very badly, people won't want to volunteer for you.

165
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,560
And then you continue to run things very badly because people don't want to volunteer for you and it becomes a vicious cycle.

166
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,360
I think

167
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,459
is why bids need to hit the ground running.

168
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,899
And Montreal really didn't.

169
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,860
And I think they're really struggling with volunteer resource as a result.

170
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,740
But I don't know, I don't know, because I don't want to volunteer for them because I think it would be an enormously thankful thankless and

171
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,980
hard thing to do, which is also the conclusion that several other people have drawn.

172
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,260
Um so it's tricky.

173
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,060
Well I think you're I I mean I can say the solution there is at that point you need your

174
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,360
like division heads and deputy division heads to be out there being uh promotional for you.

175
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:06,400
Basically the way you get volunteers if people don't really want to be a volunteer is you have to go and personally get people to volunteer.

176
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,200
by telling them how they will have a good time working for your division doing this job.

177
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,920
And I think, you know, I am susceptible to that.

178
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,920
So there are conventions I have not volunteered for, except that someone came up to me and said, Oh, would you do this?

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,560
You'd be good at it.

180
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,200
It'd be fun.

181
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,880
I'll help you, I promise.

182
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,120
Um, and then I did.

183
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,319
And then resigned.

184
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,279
I forgot about that.

185
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:33,920
No, I was g I was thinking of different different situations where they in fact you know, I d I did volunteer and have a nice time and it was worthwhile even though it was at times annoying.

186
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,900
So yeah, you I think but I think that's the solution.

187
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:43,380
And then once you have a few enthusiastic volunteers, area heads in your department, it all trickles down.

188
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,140
But I think you've then got to start from the top and top and work downwards.

189
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,120
Yep.

190
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,399
Well they've got their area heads in although they've division heads in place now.

191
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,040
So I think that's the next stage is for those people to to mobilize their their um baronies.

192
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:05,579
Uh no, so we're not going to do a detailed accounting of Montreal's division heads, but what I will say is looking through the list, there are a couple of people I think are really good, but most of them seem to be

193
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,940
uh people that I would not want to work with if you paid me.

194
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,620
So I would rather you didn't say that on the podcast because I want them to get volunteers, John.

195
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:23,800
I mean, the thing is, Alison, I don't want our listeners to volunteer for them and then be like, Oh, that was shit, I'm never volunteering for WorldCon again.

196
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,079
So I do also think

197
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,819
We pro I want to be honest about that's the other thing, which is I think Liz is right.

198
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,699
I think you do need division heads who can um stem the rot.

199
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:39,019
And I think what Montreal have done is absolutely not put people in those positions that will actually achieve that.

200
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,660
Um and I don't know what to do about that either, other than vaguely complain about it on a podcast.

201
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,300
Alright, 2028 gave presentations.

202
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,140
These were presentations from Brisbane in Australia, Nuremberg in Germany, and Kigali in Rwanda.

203
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,140
I will say that we didn't learn much more about the Brisbane bid.

204
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,380
We learned quite a lot more about the Nuremberg bid, and I hung out with the Nuremberg chaps a lot.

205
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,980
So these are Florian Bailey and Ruben Wickenhauser.

206
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,980
They are a nice bunch of lads.

207
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:16,380
Ruben writes Perry Rodan novels, which I think is like the ultimate card-carrying credential in German SF fandom.

208
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,880
And um Florian is just a youngest chap who um seems very enthusiastic.

209
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,280
I'm gonna talk about Kigali separately.

210
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,040
I thought it was interesting the difference in approach from Brisbane and Australia.

211
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,780
Brisbane didn't send anyone to SmofCon.

212
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:37,940
Um and I think they did try and send one person but it fell through, um, but they didn't have a single representative at the convention, whereas Nuremberg, both of the bid

213
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,680
chairs were in attendance and obviously Stockholm is quite a lot closer to Germany.

214
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:51,080
Um but I also think so Nuremberg chaps were going around saying like we know we need to we we know we need to talk to people in the community, we know we need to volunteer for things.

215
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:57,899
Like, we know we need to be involved with the next WorldCons if people are going to take this seriously and we're aware of all of that and we want to work with all of you.

216
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,579
And then Brisbane got asked a question in the Q<unk>A which was, are any of your bid committee volunteering for upcoming WorldCons to build

217
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,080
uh capacity and the answer was I don't know.

218
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,320
And the thing is that that is code for no they are not and you've asked this question before so I definitely know they're not but I don't want to actually admit it

219
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:27,139
And there's a real disconnect there where I think Brisbane thought they were gonna have this handed to them on a platter, and I think it really showed them up that Nuremberg were being much more

220
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,920
We had clearly realised they need to be much more plugged in, and Brisbane don't seem to have realised that.

221
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,480
And that is, I think, a problem for Brisbane.

222
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:45,680
Um Nuremberg came across, despite being a much newer bid, as being much more keen on actually working with the community, which is odd given where the two bids have come from.

223
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,320
You'd expect it to be the other way around, perhaps.

224
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:56,040
So Brisbane has had a number of sage advisors who have previously run Australian WorldCons and

225
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:05,420
some of those SAGE advisors have suggested that they may not be taking on board all the Sage advice that has been provided, or even any of it.

226
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,940
Yeah, I think I think that does come across.

227
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
And then there was Kigali.

228
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,560
Kigali did try and send someone to SmothCon, uh, which was Michael Kabunga.

229
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,080
Um Michael was denied a visa, I think, and so um

230
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,740
could not attend the convention.

231
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:23,380
They had to give their presentation virtually as a result.

232
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:28,100
And there were some technical issues, mostly because there was a very large lag on the call.

233
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,740
But there were also some dropouts which were a problem.

234
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:39,180
Um the convention looks interesting um and the site looks great and I would really love there to be a WorldCon in Africa.

235
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:45,260
And I feel sorry for them because unlike Brisbane who didn't send anyone but could have done and Nuremberg who did

236
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,440
Kigali tried to and were prevented, and that's a massive problem, right?

237
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:58,560
But after the WorldCon I heard that they were looking for people to be involved with a sort of sister organization who would be the global north.

238
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:01,319
part of their convention should they win the bid.

239
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,799
And I think what they probably actually need to do is do that in advance next time.

240
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,520
I don't think they're going to win in LA Con.

241
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,120
I'd be very surprised.

242
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:24,380
But if they're serious about wanting the WorldCon in Rwanda, I think they probably need a Western team who are able to go to conventions, represent the bid, take pre-supports, do all of that and not be solely reliant on dialing in through Zoom.

243
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,360
Um, because I think it really hurts them.

244
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:33,240
And I don't know how they build that network and that organization if they can't actually come to the conventions where they could make those links.

245
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,000
So it's really difficult.

246
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:36,600
And I just feel so

247
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,040
So I feel so sorry for them because like and even if they do bid, getting f money into Rwanda is extremely difficult.

248
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,000
So it's not even clear how they would take

249
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,840
money from people given restrictions on monetary transfers and things like that.

250
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,880
So it's hard.

251
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:52,680
Yeah.

252
00:17:52,840 --> 00:18:00,440
I mean the Chengdu WorldCon had all of these problems and solved all of these problems because of course China has an enormous, enormous resources that

253
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,300
that I suspect the Kigali Bid doesn't have.

254
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:11,460
Well even then you say they solved all the problems, but they were not taking pre-supports they were not taking memberships at Tricon 8, because they hadn't solved these problems.

255
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:11,700
Yeah.

256
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,540
I don't know, they d they solved the problems eventually, but they did have these problems.

257
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,380
It's not unique to um Africa though I think

258
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,300
I think the internet connectivity is worse.

259
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,020
Um so uh I seem to have consistently

260
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,500
terrible terrible problems with like a Zoom call to Africa that we don't get.

261
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,220
You know, the the Chinese fans did a pretty good job of of being engaged in

262
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,060
in WorldCons virtually.

263
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:52,340
Given that the Chinese WorldCon with local government support couldn't solve this problem easily, I think a Kigali bid might really, really struggle without having Western partners in advance.

264
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,540
And so I think

265
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:02,000
the advice I'd give to them is you need to recruit a Western team stat sort of two years before the bid, the vote.

266
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,760
'Cause otherwise it won't work, I don't think.

267
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,360
Which is sad but I think true.

268
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,919
Yeah, so that's I mean basically

269
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,360
Having just said, you know, Montreal, you need to get your division heads out there doing outreach.

270
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,880
One of the things that it is a thing I don't particularly

271
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,620
Oh, I don't know how we change it, but I'm not sure it is a great thing.

272
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,780
But basically a good showing at SmothCom's, which is really a gathering of like a hundred and fifty people.

273
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:34,240
Which is a very small number of the people who might eventually go to a WorldCon is usually like a key thing to actually getting your con be voted in and successful.

274
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:42,340
And I think we're really seeing what the issues can be because Brisbane have the issue of they don't seem particularly plugged in but they also have enormous distance.

275
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,340
Kigali have the problem of they can't physically get to where the Smofcons are, and I suspect they're bid

276
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:54,919
had to spend a lot of money on non-refundable travel arrangements in order to even try for a visa, which is then denied.

277
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,840
They end up losing a load of money doing that.

278
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,860
And then, you know, the internet is probably not gonna be as good in most bits of Africa.

279
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,140
I'm sure the conference center likely has pretty good internet.

280
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,340
I would not be surprised by that, but they may have been relying on

281
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:17,740
unreliable broadband or variable quality phone internet and it's just really harsh because if the answer is how do you currently get a WorldCom bid is basically

282
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:24,980
you have to set up a satellite organization who can get visas, who can take money on your behalf, who can go and out and be your ambassadors.

283
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:31,539
I think you're right in that that would probably be the way to do it, but it's just really a really sad situation.

284
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:45,180
Because then we have the situation where the bidders for Nuremberg who sound lovely and are doing absolutely the right thing by popping up and saying, Yep, we're here, we want to learn, we're keen, we're enthusiastic, but they just have such a big advantage over the others.

285
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,340
in terms of like finance and distance, um they do.

286
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,180
That I think they might win.

287
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,700
Yeah, I think it's worth noting that I'm less

288
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:00,260
I feel less sorry for Brisbane because the other thing is that Brisbane I think has ignored a lot of advice from people who have given them good advice.

289
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,940
Um, but Kigali I I don't know.

290
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,600
You're right, right?

291
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:11,520
It shouldn't be incumbent on African WorldCon to basically have a second American organization that can m let them win

292
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:20,180
Because that's the thing, like I have a friend who works in the university sector and they had someone who's doing genocide research in Rwanda and it was funded, but you can't send money to Rwanda.

293
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,740
You just can't.

294
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,500
There are there are global

295
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,139
impediments to doing that in the fabric of how we do banking.

296
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,779
So what they were doing is they were coating themselves in money before getting on the plane.

297
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,500
And when the university found out about that they were like, Absolutely fucking not, this is a risk assessment nightmare and now they have to Western Union

298
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,700
Not Western Union.

299
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:49,260
They they use couriers to take the money into Rwanda to deposit it with the person and the amount of money they spend on that significantly reduces the amount of funding.

300
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,220
And so it's like, well and that's not fair.

301
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:57,140
If that w research was happening in, I don't know, France, it you wouldn't have that.

302
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,340
And I don't

303
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,159
That's a problem, right?

304
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:09,080
Because we're limited in what we can solve and these impediments are global geopolitics which are UN level and we can't we don't have any power over that at all.

305
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,500
So it's like what do we do?

306
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:19,220
The only thing we can do is work with the system as it exists, but it's it is really sad that the system as it exists is so stacked against an African world combat.

307
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:25,700
Yeah, and there's such a big barrier, like, you know, if Brisbane come to someone in Europe and say, Hey, we can't make it to Smofcon, can you be our ambassador?

308
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,940
We'll send you all the information, that's totally different than

309
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,380
Someone saying, hey, we can't, you know, we can't take any money into Rwanda.

310
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:39,340
Can you be our financial agent is a whole extra like level of responsibility that's gonna be hard to hard to find

311
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:49,039
I don't know whether we really have um have gathered the information on on best practice on visa acquisition because it doesn't seem to me to be

312
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,240
impossible to get these visas and I'm slightly surprised that they keep getting turned down.

313
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,560
I mean I know I know it can be difficult.

314
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,200
I

315
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:06,080
think based on, you know, anecdotal and experience from people I work with that you are uh vastly overestimating

316
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,120
the ease of getting visas.

317
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:21,400
I've been to I've been to scientific conferences with like high level people there and there are people presenting on video who said, Yeah, I got refused a visa by this EU country to come and present at this large global international conference.

318
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,580
Many, many of them.

319
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,300
It's just like uh you don't know and it could be any one thing.

320
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,860
Once you've got one, I think it becomes easier to get the next one and the next one and it's snowballs.

321
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,060
But it is, I think, very, very difficult.

322
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,580
I I suppose also if you've got a team in Rwanda or

323
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:50,880
They're not actually in Rwanda, but if you have a team bidding for Kigali of Africans, then perhaps we need to be they need to be planning on three or four of them applying for visas in the hopes that one of them will get one.

324
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,280
Yeah, but then that's four flights, four sets of hotel bookings, etc.

325
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,080
Yeah.

326
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,860
Yeah.

327
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,140
Scandalous.

328
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,180
Scandalous.

329
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,780
No, I mean that's uh yeah.

330
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,420
No, it is.

331
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,380
Uh just just fills me with impotent rage, really.

332
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,980
Okay, change the law.

333
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:08,860
It's outrageous.

334
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,659
Oh my god.

335
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:15,260
So yeah, so the 2029 and 2030 um presentations were also relatively unremarkable.

336
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,340
Both bids look extremely capable.

337
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,620
I don't think there was a lot of extra information in there that we didn't really know.

338
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,340
They both seem to be pretty plugged into the community.

339
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,220
Both of them had representatives in the room.

340
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:29,320
Um and yeah, they seem to be doing well.

341
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:31,559
Um and I don't really have much to report.

342
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:35,320
And for those for those who don't know those 2029 and 2030 bits.

343
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,799
And then I think we get into the interesting bit.

344
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,120
Do either of you have anything on Dublin or Edmonton?

345
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,120
Looking forward to both those conventions.

346
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,240
Sounds good.

347
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:51,640
Um so 2031, Sarah Felix stood up and said that she supposed she was the bid chair for the Texas uh bid in 2031.

348
00:24:51,840 --> 00:25:00,640
I think there is an open question here, which is you might not want to be putting a lot of effort into a US WorldCom bid until after the presidential election in 2028.

349
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
So I think I'm gonna wait till

350
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:10,040
uh that happens before I see whether that bid explodes into life or um quietly um fades away.

351
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,480
But there wasn't a lot of

352
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:20,200
Detail and then twenty twenty twenty thirty-two Nantes in France stood up and declared their intentions

353
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,000
And I've linked in the show notes listeners to Nantes Utopials.

354
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,560
Apologies to France if I'm pronouncing it wrong.

355
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,920
And that is a big kind of science fiction festival which is held

356
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,980
In Nantes.

357
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,260
And yeah, they had a video.

358
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:34,980
It was very shiny.

359
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:36,900
They were like, we want you to come to France.

360
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:42,179
And I thought very hard, I'd love to come to France, but I have been burnt before.

361
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:50,120
Um and for listeners who don't know, there have been a lot of French WorldCon bids that have kind of announced for eight years in advance and then

362
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,280
sort of quietly died away.

363
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,800
And so I'd love this one to be the one where there's actually a world con in France.

364
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,560
Oh, this is different though.

365
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,960
Yes, it's not Nice.

366
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,519
Two and a half thousand guest authors.

367
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,799
Yes, it's giant.

368
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,240
So this is a big, this is a giant festival.

369
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
WorldCon would be as a tiny pimple on its side.

370
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:19,760
Yeah, so is it is it a commitment to having a thing separ a WorldCon separate to the Utopials from the same team, or just some other people in Nantes who would like to run a WorldCon?

371
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
I think it's definitely one of those, Liz.

372
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,100
It's unclear to me exactly what I I think they're bidding for a WorldCom.

373
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,299
They're not bidding to make this festival into a WorldCom.

374
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,820
Um but I think they're showing that like they have the genre links.

375
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,740
But I confess the

376
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:41,340
There weren't any slides there was just a video about this festival and all of their promo stuff.

377
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:42,860
I mean, I they gave me a baseball

378
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,560
hat because I sang them the alphabet in in French at the international party.

379
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,480
And so but that has nonce uto utopials on it.

380
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,640
Um so I think I I think it's fair to say that at the moment they're quite heavily leaning on this branding.

381
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,840
But I didn't get the impression that the idea was to make this event a worldcon.

382
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,720
But I might I might have been wrong and I'd be I'd I'd be interested to see more concrete details in the future.

383
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,760
This is

384
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:16,419
twenty thirty two and if we're quick we can get our fight and our breakup and our makeup and our next hundred and fifty episodes in before that, can't we?

385
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,980
So they've got a while.

386
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:31,419
Yeah, but I think I think it is crucial to know because Utopiales I have seen lots of authors saying they're going to Utopiales and they had a great time, but I think it is a big thing with like a big city promotional effort.

387
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,220
And it looks to me like I suspect it's like a professionally run thing and there is a professionally run organization behind it.

388
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:44,660
So I think it's important to know whether it's those people who wish to use some of their professional expertise to run what I think would be a, you know, great WorldCon.

389
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:54,340
Or is it some people who are also from Nantes and then want to put something else on that might be then competing with the same people?

390
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,300
For locals?

391
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:03,380
I think I can say I'm pretty sure that w at least one of the people on the stage was involved with this festival.

392
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:12,180
Uh the other person on the stage was Anouk Arnal, who is a French fan that I've seen at WorldCons and stuff before.

393
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:17,299
So I think there is like a there is a traditional fanish component to the people who want this to happen.

394
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:25,220
And I think there might also be some involvement from the from the festival um people as well who would quite like WorldCon to happen in not.

395
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,419
So like I think it

396
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,280
I think it might be kind of a a hybridization of different influences coming together, if that makes sense.

397
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,240
They did get asked whether the festival was professional.

398
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:43,519
And they gave like the most wiggly answer, which w which but we basically boiled down to, yes it is, but we also use volunteers.

399
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,480
And it's like, okay.

400
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,840
Well, I think we've discussed before that if you there is a situation where you have some people paid to put it on.

401
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,560
I'll work full time on it, etc.

402
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,040
And then some volunteers who fill in the gaps and we've discussed, you know, the pros and cons of that.

403
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,920
But yeah.

404
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,000
It's twenty I mean it's twenty thirty-two.

405
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,600
You can like we'll come back to this in ten years' time.

406
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,160
Not quite ten years down, but you know what I mean.

407
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:04,800
Five years.

408
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,440
Five years.

409
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,360
There was no interest expressed for twenty thirty-three, so that's still wide open.

410
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,240
And then twenty twenty th twenty thirty-four

411
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:20,880
Meg McDonald stood up and told us about the Glasgow 2034 WorldCom bid, which we talked about quite a lot last episode.

412
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,320
I don't think there's much new here.

413
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:32,080
They've got a couple of dates booked for the SEC and still think a 2034 Glass Region WorldCon would be great and think Meg would be great at running it.

414
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,600
So no notes.

415
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:43,820
Oh, uh Meg wants everyone to write a postcard um and give it to her so that they can be let like messages to your future self that you can read at the convention.

416
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,780
Oh, that's quite fun.

417
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:54,220
Because the theme of the convention is planting seeds for the future and like building a future that you might not be around to participate in, but trying to build that future anyway.

418
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,860
Um and it's in the vision statement on the SmothCon QA page.

419
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,700
Um but it's it's quite beautiful.

420
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,419
I think it's quite a beautiful, quite a coherent vision.

421
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,040
Of of like what they're trying to achieve, which is neat.

422
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:11,840
It is, although you've just made me think, right, how many of those people who write a postcard to their future self are gonna be dead by twenty thirty-four?

423
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,640
Liz!

424
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,820
Sorry, it's the way you phrased it, John.

425
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,620
Liz.

426
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,220
Uh, okay.

427
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,140
Any questions on Meg?

428
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,980
I think we approve.

429
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,300
Good.

430
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,020
And then more excitement.

431
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,180
Uh so twenty thirty-five, Poland stood up and basically said

432
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,399
We're not a hundred percent sure, but we kind of want to do it.

433
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,080
And if we do do it, it'll be that year because it's a centenary of Polish fandom.

434
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,519
So yeah.

435
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,200
Like we're looking at it and we're thinking about it and we're turning it around in our heads.

436
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,320
And Polish fandom are incredible, so if they do decide to do it, I suspect it will go well.

437
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:57,420
And then Checkia stood up a couple who uh involved with the Festival Fantasy, which is a Prague-based comic-con.

438
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,179
have said that they would quite like to uh run a WorldCon.

439
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:09,139
And I say this is a Comic Con, but like I saw some of the con publications and it looks quite comfortably in our

440
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,480
Put it this way, I recognise a panel when I see one and they have a lot of panels.

441
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,279
Um and um and yeah

442
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,360
So I think I think that would be really good.

443
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,720
They had um little armbands and I got a lanyard and it was neat.

444
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,280
And they also had rum and the rum was very good.

445
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,040
But yeah, no, so that would be exciting.

446
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,880
So I think they're thinking of Prague.

447
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,000
I did also talk to at least one other Czech fan.

448
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,520
Who thinks they should have it in Berno?

449
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,720
So I don't know.

450
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,080
I've put um I I'm not sure whether they're far enough along to have a a defined venue.

451
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,180
Um, but I'd be all over a Czech WorldCon.

452
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,380
I think that would be great.

453
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,060
Prague Prague is lovely.

454
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,180
I've never been to Brno.

455
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,340
Um, I'm sure it's also great.

456
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,260
I am sensing a theme in the people who were standing up for future years.

457
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,740
Yes, I would uh describe them as European.

458
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,380
Mm-hmm.

459
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,900
Yeah, so it's interesting, right?

460
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,500
Because if Brisbane if Nuremberg won in twenty eight

461
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:10,380
That would mean 28, 29, 32, 34, 35, and a s unspecified unknown future year might all be European world cons.

462
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,480
And that is quite a reversal from historical trends.

463
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:24,160
I don't know whether an Antipodean bid might come up for twenty thirty-three if Brisbane doesn't win in twenty eight, 'cause that would be five years later, and that is possibly enough time to

464
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,360
sort of reload and go again.

465
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:33,399
Or twenty thirty-one to be fair, depending on on whether Texas decides to move into high gear or decides to

466
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,220
decides not to do that.

467
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,860
The real question is you need to have it's not enough to have one WorldCon in Germany, right?

468
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,620
Or one WorldCon in France.

469
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,640
What you ideally need is you need France or Germany to run want to run a WorldCon every decade.

470
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,320
But you need like um you need people who want to do this

471
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,920
decadally to maintain you can't rely on a completely new group of people doing every single world coin.

472
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
It does not that will not work.

473
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,640
And so

474
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,840
Ireland and the UK have ended up like doing decade apart world cons, and that seems to be continuing.

475
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Um, but I'll be very curious to know whether

476
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:21,540
France, Poland, Czechia or Germany can end up in that situation as well, or whether it'll be like Finland, where they're like, that was very fun, but we're not going to do it again.

477
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:29,960
Because it would be great to have a situation in which fifty percent of world cons were European, but it it does require those countries to keep on bidding decade or decade.

478
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,840
Yeah, and I think it's an interesting question about whether

479
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:43,220
the fact that, you know, Australia was twenty tw two thousand five and then there was New Zealand in twenty twenty, which I think mostly due to the pandemic and not their own

480
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,820
uh fault has kind of burned quite a few of those people out.

481
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:51,020
But basically has it been too long since there was one in Australia?

482
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:58,940
And now all the people that you might previously have tapped to like help are twenty years older than they were and don't want to particularly

483
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,820
get involved at a high level might make your life more difficult.

484
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:10,940
And so I think you're right in that, you know, trying to do it every ten years, then you'll have some junior people who step up, some people who are still there from the last one, et cetera, et cetera.

485
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,320
enough kind of institutional knowledge to keep you ticking along.

486
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:21,600
Yeah, y there's a reason why y if you look at the conventions, it tends to be about a decade between cons.

487
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,440
Like it's not always you know, sometimes it's nine, sometimes it's eleven.

488
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,799
Um but if you have a break of much longer than that, I do think you risk starting to lose some of that some of that momentum.

489
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,559
But I think the other thing you do, and this is something that came this is an opinion I have that came from Tammy in the bar at Smothcom.

490
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:48,080
is one of the things that European Worldcons do well or or perhaps do better than North American World Cons is that the teams running divisions in European World Cons tend to be bigger.

491
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,240
So you have like at least one division head and at least one deputy division head.

492
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,419
And the deputy division head will often be younger, uh, or newer.

493
00:34:55,819 --> 00:35:02,140
Uh and so you have this thing where you're building capacity every time you run a WorldCon, whereas in the States or well, sorry

494
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,980
In North America, if you have one person running a division, you're not building any capacity.

495
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:13,300
And if you have one person running a division and you only hold them every 20 years, you're definitely not building capacity.

496
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:21,440
So that that's the other thing that's happening, like Luncom three built a lot of capacity and the people who came in in Luncom ended up running Glasgow.

497
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:26,359
And then Glasgow will have built capacity that Glasgow thirty-four will use and so on.

498
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,559
And so I think we need to think more and I think North

499
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,520
North American cons are doing this badly, and that comes back to the thing we mentioned about Montreal right at the start.

500
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,080
Like you look at that DH list, and there are very few DDHs and co-DHs mentioned, and that means that

501
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,720
those people are not building capacity and are not looking futureward, and that's a problem.

502
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,720
And I think that's why European fandom seems to have a lot of youngsters or newer people who are keen to run worldcons, and North American fandom seems to be

503
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,620
aging out of common running in a way that Europe isn't.

504
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,060
So yeah, or burning out might be a better way of putting it.

505
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,780
I do think I do think Trump has all made it a lot harder for America though.

506
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,660
Oh yeah.

507
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,579
So so that deep-seated lack of enthusiasm to go to America.

508
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,140
That's true, but even before Trump, like

509
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,700
It's notable because I don't think if Trump had been elect if Trump hadn't been elected, I don't think there would be US bids.

510
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,780
There'd still only be one US bid, right?

511
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,740
There might be ones for like the mid to late thirties.

512
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,660
God, it's weird to say the thirties.

513
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:34,299
But like I don't know I still think there are fewer US bids than you'd expect, even with that.

514
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:47,180
Yeah, and also Montreal, you would you might think that there would be some people who would quite like to run one in North America but don't want to do it in the US who would be um on that.

515
00:36:47,460 --> 00:37:00,020
I mean I think uh the to the D D H thing, I mean they could still be recruiting them, but I think one nice thing London had is that it had a lot of those deputy division heads in place really early on and then you actually get to kind of shape everything.

516
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:06,460
You don't feel like you've come in halfway through the process and everything is already set and all you can really do is like run someone else's plan.

517
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:13,980
LunCon 3 was a very good convention in lots of ways and one of the ways is it bred a generation of European conrunners.

518
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,000
Don't make me look at the Luncon list of division heads and figure out how many never ran a division again.

519
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,080
Well, I mean I I kind of did.

520
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,680
Death three of us.

521
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,440
I I because I was a D D H at Luncon and it kind of

522
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,119
convinced me I was never gonna do a job that big on a work on ever again as long as I lived.

523
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,599
So, you know, sorry guys.

524
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,359
Well it's good to know

525
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,839
You're always the thing is that literally everyone on any WorldCon committee will eventually stop running Worldcons.

526
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,560
The the key is to make as many of them want to run at least one more before they stop.

527
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,980
I I I'm happy to do things at WorldCons and do smaller jobs at World Cons.

528
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,339
It was just that the way that I personally

529
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:05,480
reacted to being a D D H wasn't necessarily mentally the best way to go about it, as a result of which I

530
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:13,580
I spent four months literally waking up in the morning and doing nothing but work on things until I went to bed and and that's not good.

531
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,940
Speaking of SmothCon, John went SmothCon.

532
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,540
I did go to SmothCon.

533
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,820
I'd like to thank Glasgow 2024 for a bursary that enabled me to attend.

534
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,600
Thank you very much to those lovely people over there.

535
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,280
It was in a place called Stockholm, which is in a country called Sweden.

536
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,720
It was chaired by Carolina Gomez Lagoloff.

537
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,660
and uh very capable committee of Swedish folk.

538
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,060
Any gossip, gossip from SmofCon.

539
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,860
Gossip that you can tell everyone and then some gossip you can't.

540
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,140
Gossip or interesting thoughts, John.

541
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:50,779
Either one.

542
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,940
I very much enjoyed Smothcom.

543
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,260
It was a very good group of people.

544
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,559
who I enjoyed spending time with.

545
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,319
The meetings I had were great.

546
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,680
It really made me enthusiastic about come running and want to get more involved and that was very good.

547
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,440
And the programming was very good.

548
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:14,840
I will say there were two things I noticed, maybe three things.

549
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,940
which I thought were less good.

550
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:25,059
And basically I think it's there were there were a lot of technical issues.

551
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,299
Like and so sort of

552
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:36,020
There were there were no roving mics, so if you have hearing problems, the convention just did not care about you, I think.

553
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,740
Like moderators were generally repeating

554
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:44,220
questions, but that is error prone and hard and puts a lot of pressure on the moderator.

555
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:50,300
And I don't think having a roving mic in this day and age, like you do do do that.

556
00:39:50,460 --> 00:40:00,860
And I think part of that is also that I think this convention should be modelling best practice and I don't and so I think it sends a real message

557
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:12,700
If the convention doesn't prioritize that about what the convention thinks about access, and it's very difficult to see panel items about access at a convention that has decided to sacrifice access.

558
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,920
at it sort of in its own case.

559
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's like, well, okay, but eh.

560
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,480
There was no green room and the programme was left very late.

561
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,520
And like, I mean listeners last episode heard me find out I was on a panel live on the podcast because I checked.

562
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,680
And if I had not have checked, like I would not have known because there was no email.

563
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:40,279
And I think in general, panel items were interesting topics where the moderator and panelists did not seem to have really prepped in advance.

564
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,240
I think that is partly because the convention did not

565
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,119
aid you in doing that in any way.

566
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:51,280
But I think that's very distressing because like I am privileged in this situation that I got a bursary to attend

567
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:58,700
But like if Michael had managed to come from Rwanda and managed to do the visa and managed to spend the thousands of pounds to be there like

568
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,060
We should be trying better to give him like a good time when he's there, like give him a productive time.

569
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,339
And like it felt really privileged in a way I can't quite put my finger on that like

570
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,839
people didn't that the convention didn't take itself more seriously.

571
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:20,359
It felt like a convention where it's like, well we all know you're just here to chat to the people that are here.

572
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,020
So we don't need to put as much effort into the convention side.

573
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,540
And I'm like, but there are people for whom this is their entry.

574
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,340
And I think taking that attitude

575
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,400
is really problematic and privileged in regards to newer people in the community.

576
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,440
And that disappointed me really a lot

577
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,720
And and yeah, those are my two big points.

578
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,319
But I had a great time!

579
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,880
It's amazing how how much you enjoy a convention is not necessarily connected with how well run it is.

580
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:52,020
But I the reason I had a great time is because I was there with loads of people I knew already.

581
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:59,539
And if you don't know people, how good you find the convention is directly correlated to how good how well we're on the convention is, and that's the thing.

582
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,540
Oh yeah.

583
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,500
Oh yes.

584
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,380
The people who are less privileged and less connected are gonna have the worst end of this stick.

585
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,900
So it made me angrier.

586
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,780
Oh I was so cross at points.

587
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,220
I was so cross.

588
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,119
You'll just have to run a Smofcon, John.

589
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,160
I mean, I'm on the committee for the Lisbon one.

590
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,520
Oh, okay.

591
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,240
I'm doing their Discord.

592
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,960
So there will be a Discord and it will be good.

593
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,420
Good.

594
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:31,460
Yeah, because I I feel I really want the virtual parts of SmothCon to be excellent.

595
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:37,780
If we're trying to foster and grow a global community of conrunners, yeah.

596
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:45,600
They obviously aren't gonna be able to go to Stockholm or Lisbon or Seattle or wherever the next one is gonna be every year.

597
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:54,359
You know, and we can't say yes, there are some people who do, but we can't say that that's the only way you get to be involved in this conversation about conrunning.

598
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,079
Yeah, I think that was what I was saying.

599
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:05,359
Like at the moment it feels like success at bidding for a whirl con is not completely but quite coupled into uh coming to SmofCons.

600
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,599
And if we can't decouple that then we

601
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:16,160
have to make sure the people who come to SmopCons are getting a good opportunity by putting their time and effort into coming.

602
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,620
It's the same in academic conferences, right?

603
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:23,340
Like, if you want to build collaborations, academic conferences are where you go to do that largely.

604
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:29,260
And so, like, I don't think this is unique to SmothCon per se, but I do think the more we can do to help

605
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:38,480
People attend and come from outside the traditional com running community, the more inclusive we are as a community.

606
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,640
As someone who is currently recording the 150th episode of a podcast, which is

607
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:45,980
primarily inspired by a desire to bring people in.

608
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,780
It distresses me when other people don't put the same effort I put into trying to include people.

609
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:57,500
And maybe that's just holding everyone else to a very, very high standard, but I hold myself to that standard, so I'm not being a hypocrite at least.

610
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,440
And we will hold the twenty twenty six SMOFCON to that standard.

611
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,000
Yeah.

612
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,760
But Esther will probably meet that standard, so that's good.

613
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah, but the self-fulfilling thing, right?

614
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:14,640
Like you probably wouldn't have signed up to be on the committee for the next MofCon if you didn't think the Next Mofcon was capable of doing a good job.

615
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,240
So Yes.

616
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,100
See everything else we've been talking about this episode.

617
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,940
Round and round we go, yeah.

618
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,740
I think when I first got into fandom there was an exp there was a belief that if you wanted to run a WorldCon

619
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,960
you needed to be to have the wherewithal, i.

620
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,120
e.

621
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,720
the money, to travel around the world bidding that it wasn't just you need to go to Smofcon, but you need to be seen at multiple

622
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,740
international conventions.

623
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,420
And obviously you could do that with having a big team who will run tables for you.

624
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,059
But I still think it's not just Smofcon.

625
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,099
I think you do have to be at other international conventions to to progress your bid.

626
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,380
Um, I don't think

627
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,400
I I think that's probably got slightly better over the years, but I don't think it's yeah, you know, I don't think it's gone away at all.

628
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:02,839
I don't th so I SmofCon is at least putting a focus on the place that you have to be

629
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:10,460
I think when I think this is the thing so people talk about academic conferences and they're like we need to expand virtual participation.

630
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,620
And they're not wrong.

631
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:19,220
But the other thing is that like as someone who's done virtual particip participation at both academic conferences and science fiction conventions

632
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:26,780
I think it is still, despite all of the work we have put into making it as good as we can, it is still harder to network virtually than it is in person.

633
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,000
And so the other thing is that like I think this is actually a phenomenally difficult problem to solve.

634
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,440
And the way you do that is to try and do bursaries and to try and invite people.

635
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,200
But I think you do also need to try and do the virtual participation for the people who can't attend physically.

636
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:50,280
like the Kigali people where there is international geopolitical reasons where they can't and so we need to make sure there are avenues for them even if those avenues are

637
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,660
not perfect.

638
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,260
They need to be as good as they can be.

639
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:58,620
Yeah, what will be interesting to me is the first time we kind of have a WorldCon bid which

640
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:04,780
basically does things in a totally different way and it's a success nonetheless and that will be a really interesting model.

641
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,580
Alright.

642
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,340
So that's my SmophCon gossip.

643
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:14,140
Oh and also the hotel did breakfast, very good breakfast, the creps were amazing, but also did fika and dinner.

644
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:14,540
Oh

645
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:15,800
Mm-hmm.

646
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,040
And given it was a hundred pounds a night for a room, that was quite good.

647
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,800
Cause it meant you didn't have to pay Sweden prices for dinner if you didn't want to.

648
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,640
You could just eat in the hotel for free.

649
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,840
It's quite nice.

650
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:34,859
Yeah, so I got to have Fika with friend of the podcast Anna and I got to have a cardam bun and it was a big bun and it was it was very lovely.

651
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,300
There was also infinite free coffee, which was great.

652
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:41,260
Um I think that's everything I had on SmothCon.

653
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:42,839
Oh I met a man called Tim.

654
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,640
Tim's great.

655
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,599
If you're listening, Tim.

656
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,240
Hello.

657
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,000
Is Tim a listener?

658
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,839
Or did you just convert him on the spot?

659
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,680
I think Tim's already a listener.

660
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,960
Uh Tim listener Tim is also working with us for gaming on LA Con 5.

661
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:05,640
And he has ideas about scavenger hunts that link virtual and physical uh participants uh in sort of ways where you have to work together in order to do the scavenger hunt.

662
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,760
And I'm excited.

663
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,780
Ooh, that sounds very exciting.

664
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:15,540
Yeah, he also runs board game conventions and video game conventions like in his spare time, so um he's a he's a triple threat.

665
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:17,700
Yeah.

666
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,060
Should we do picks?

667
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:19,820
Picks.

668
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,940
I'm not gonna pick Tim, but I was tempted.

669
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,660
I think that that's a lot of lot of expectation to put on one person's shoulders, Sean.

670
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,100
Uh who wants to pick first?

671
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,960
So I picked a book, John picked a book.

672
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:40,599
So shall we do books a book sandwich of Alison's book?

673
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,760
Alison's also picked a book, right?

674
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,800
A booklet, yes, sort of book.

675
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,720
A a waffer thin book.

676
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,640
Oh, it was kind of ordinary sized for reasons that will become apparent.

677
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,960
In that case, yes, Liz, you go first.

678
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,240
Uh I am gonna pick a book.

679
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,480
The book I have picked is The Buffalo Hunter Hunter by Stephen Graham Jones.

680
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,360
It is

681
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,420
A historical Western vampire novel.

682
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:09,579
I mean, yeah, it's defin it's definitely a horror novel, so I think it might have been off the radar of some of our listeners, but it should be on their radar, I think.

683
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,660
Um it's essentially it's

684
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:22,840
follows it's one of these novels where there's like uh a framing story within a framing story and then so there's the framing story on the outside which is an academic from 2012

685
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,200
uh who is looking at the rediscovery of her great-great-grandfather's journals.

686
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:34,720
That great-great-grandfather was a pastor in Montana, and his journals basically contain the oral retelling of the story of

687
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:46,560
Uh a Blackfoot named Goodstab, who as we as we get through the story, um i he's never named as a vampire, but bec he becomes a vampire essentially, and this is all tied up with the kind of

688
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:58,700
uh historical massacre of the Blackfoot Nation and kind of the the cultural position of Goodstab versus the the Western uh colonizers of the the West in the

689
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:01,660
late 1800s, the extinction of the buffaloes.

690
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,220
And yeah, it's really I've I really enjoyed it.

691
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:09,339
It's got kind of three distinct narratives that have very different voices, which I really enjoyed.

692
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:17,740
And it's clear that like the native voice here, there are like interesting stuff around the word choices and what word choices he uses when he's retelling his history.

693
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:29,180
versus when he is talking to the pastor in the framing story and it just does a really nice job of then tying up all these three individuals and you you kind of figure out what is going on.

694
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,780
I really enjoyed it and I think it is definitely worth a read.

695
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,300
It is quite gory and it's definitely a horror novel, so that might put some of you off.

696
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,820
But if you're happy with kind of a lot of blood and gore and revenge, then it's definitely worth reading.

697
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,380
Nice.

698
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,220
I like vampires.

699
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:51,260
It makes me think like a bit of it, it makes you think, you know, it makes you it does have a reference, like it's got a reference to Dracula in there.

700
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,660
It knows it's kind of doing the the Dracula like

701
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:02,480
uh uh novel through letters and it also kind of has resonance with like interview with a vampire which I confess I never finished but does have the framing story of like

702
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,320
you know, he is doing an interview with a literal vampire.

703
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,280
So it definitely kind of knows the tradition it comes from.

704
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,720
Yeah, but I really uh yeah, I just really liked it.

705
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,560
But yes, there is a bit of like

706
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,960
I don't think it's like gratuitous.

707
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:24,760
It's just kind of a fact of Goodstab's story is how much kind of blood and gore it involves in the nature of how he is a vampire.

708
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,400
Ah

709
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:33,300
So when I said I liked vampires, I did once read a story on Uncanny that made me pass out because it had too much blood drinking in.

710
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:38,020
So like on a scale of one to ten, how drum friendly is this book?

711
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:38,820
Mmm.

712
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,480
Like a zero.

713
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:49,200
I'm gonna I'm gonna claim I'm gonna claim a trigger exception to my um still theoretically occurring, but perhaps not as

714
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,400
uh successful as I would like Project to read all of you guys' pics.

715
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,920
'Cause I don't want to pass out.

716
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:02,279
Yeah, I think uh I'm scared to even like tell you what happens in it in case it makes you pass out.

717
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:03,960
I mean I've

718
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,700
The thing is it's I can watch things with gore much more easily than I can read about them.

719
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:18,500
Yeah, it's also like Goodstab narrative is his very like, you know, he's it's an oral history, it's all first person, so it's all about him personally, like

720
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,760
Feeding on blood.

721
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,640
So that might be quite tricky for you, John.

722
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,280
Alright, this might be just a book for me and for the listeners.

723
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,560
Enjoy it, listeners.

724
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,600
Tell me if it's good.

725
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,060
Alright.

726
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,900
Alison's picking a booklet.

727
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,260
Sort of, yes.

728
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,940
My pick is The Lost Nose by John Sladek.

729
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:41,900
The text of which appears in his collection maps of the uncollected works of John the previously uncollected works of John Sladek.

730
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:48,140
Um this was a book that John made for his then girlfriend, later wife, Pamela.

731
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,760
Sometimes towards the end of the nineteen sixties and it's it's handmade, it's con it consists of like paper collages

732
00:51:56,299 --> 00:51:59,339
bits and pieces of things that are stuck in.

733
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,140
Um it's the most it's about thirty pages long, but they're quite f

734
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,980
thick, so when you actually pick it up it's quite a thick book.

735
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,940
I believe it is now in the Science Fiction Foundation.

736
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:15,540
But at some point it came to me because I had the cunning plan to

737
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:20,020
create an internet version of this.

738
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,180
This I feel like about the time of Jeff Ryman's two five three.

739
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:24,740
Um

740
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,560
So early, early internet times and I scanned the entire thing.

741
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,760
I don't think my scanner was quite as good as the scanner I have now.

742
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,040
Um, but I have scans and they're not terrible.

743
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,279
And nothing ever came of it because, you know, projects.

744
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:49,920
And now on a Discord somewhere we occasionally play through game books and we're playing through this one at the moment so that I can

745
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:55,900
And I've kind of gone back to all the scans and processed them so that they're now individual sections of the book.

746
00:52:56,059 --> 00:52:59,420
And after that I might go back to um

747
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:08,120
the Sladok estate and the places that have this book and say, Maybe might we put this on the internet somewhere because the tools to do this now

748
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,740
this thing that was would have been an enormous amount of work when I first had the idea and so I didn't do it.

749
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:19,580
You know, there are now websites that allow you to create interactive stories in this app but just by kind of clicking and dragging.

750
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,260
Um so

751
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,099
We'll see.

752
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:32,220
Um many people have said, Oh, what we need to do is do a facsimile edition and and make money at it, but I'm not sure if it would ever make any money.

753
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,180
It's very strange.

754
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,779
Fred has lost his nose.

755
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,539
And it's a game book.

756
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:43,400
It's actually in the great internet archive of game books, which I didn't know existed, but was very pleased to discover.

757
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,079
Um so if you're on said Discord, you know, you can come and play it with us.

758
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,599
And if you're not, um, then watch this space.

759
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,559
So is is the copy you had and scanned literally the only copy in existence?

760
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,520
There is only one.

761
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,240
It was a present.

762
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:01,039
It's it's it's a handmade book that he made as a Christmas present for his girlfriend

763
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,779
That's pretty cool.

764
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,539
You know, it's extremely cool.

765
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:07,700
Uh and it is I mean I I I ha I haven't looked very, very closely.

766
00:54:07,779 --> 00:54:10,579
There may be a point where I'm gonna have to put a trigger warning on it saying

767
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,600
You know, this was made in the late nineteen sixties and they did things differently then.

768
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:20,360
Um, but I don't think I haven't sp seen anything like that yet, so um fingers crossed it'll be all right.

769
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,820
So very exciting.

770
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:22,780
That sounds interesting.

771
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,140
I'm looking forward to playing through it.

772
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,300
And it is it it's not i it's not

773
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,599
great science fiction or anything or even a great gay book, but it's just very funny in places.

774
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,320
So there we go.

775
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,920
Um and I've linked to that book uh in the show notes.

776
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,560
It's on it's on Blackwells, so like it's not

777
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:47,640
Not too tricky to get top your No no no that's the that's the version that's the chat book produced by Big Engine that doesn't have any pictures in it.

778
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,279
Oh.

779
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,279
So it's got the s it's it's got the text, but no art.

780
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,720
Because the art

781
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,600
Because theoretically there was always going to be some sort of facsimile.

782
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,960
I see, okay.

783
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,520
I am also gonna pick a book.

784
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:07,600
I am gonna pick a book called Your Wish Is My Command by Dina Mohammed.

785
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,400
Uh this was a finalist for the Hugo Award in Glasgow.

786
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,640
Um so this is a book which is about wishes.

787
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,200
And it's a graphic novel set in a alternate Cairo.

788
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,800
It's a world where wishes exist and there are first class wishes and second-class wishes and third class wishes.

789
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,920
And a third class wish is more likely to go wrong.

790
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:36,600
So like you wish for something and the wish is creatively interpreted and you get something that is not at all what you wanted.

791
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:42,140
But first class wishes will give you exactly what you wish for when you wish for it.

792
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:51,180
And they are so much more terrifying because they will give you what you've asked for regardless of whether or not you've thought through any of the implications of your wish.

793
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:56,880
And it follows the three first class wishes that a street vendor has to sell.

794
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,960
And it's and it follows three people, each of whom come into contact with one of these.

795
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:04,020
Um, wishes.

796
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,819
And yeah, it's beautifully illustrated.

797
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:11,220
It talks about various aspects of identity.

798
00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:11,460
The

799
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,520
The character I resonated with most is the character who's struggling with anxiety and mental health for obvious reasons.

800
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:24,320
And I thought that arc of the book, which is the second act basically, um, was incredibly beautiful.

801
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,820
And it's just it's just awesome.

802
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:33,420
And I originally borrowed it from Neil and Nick, but I now have my own copy.

803
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:38,140
And that means that next time I see Liz, I can force Liz to read it.

804
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,500
I'm in agreement with the plan, I should say.

805
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:42,140
John is not allowed to just force me to randomly read books.

806
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:46,619
Oh yeah, no, because if I was, you'd be reading the entire Star Wars expanded universe, Liz.

807
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,860
You too will know who Corin Horn is and why.

808
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,340
I feel I have learnt everything I ever needed to know about Corin Horn.

809
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,360
But Liz, he's the Galaxy's best fighter pilot, detective, Jedi, and lover.

810
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,480
This is still like Garth Rekki's Dark Place.

811
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,720
It is it is a lot like that, except it's played entirely straight

812
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,900
Um, so sort of.

813
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,540
Um, but yeah, so it's it's just really good.

814
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,500
I would highly recommend.

815
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:21,180
I mean, I suspect several readers will have read it when it was um a Hugo finalist, although I will say

816
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:27,040
The version in the Voter Pack, I believe, I'm remembering correctly, ha was like a PDF with massive watermarks on it.

817
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,240
So I just found it completely unreasonable readable.

818
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,800
Um but like yeah, if you can get your hands on a proper copy, um then I highly recommend.

819
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,920
It's really good.

820
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,760
Oh that would that would explain why I haven't read it then.

821
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:46,480
No, it does annoy me when they do that, 'cause I'm like, it's just I know you don't want people to pirate it, but if people really want to pirate it, they'll pirate it anyway and uh

822
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,960
Alison made a noise while I was talking about it and I couldn't tell whether that was because she had Googled it and thought it looked cool or something else.

823
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,040
No, I I had

824
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,960
Gone down a rabbit hole.

825
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,800
So sorry John, I zoned out.

826
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,240
I am a terrible human being.

827
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,040
That's right.

828
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:04,280
And that was the Alt Thought Podcast.

829
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:05,640
And it's goodbye for me.

830
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,160
It's goodbye from me.

831
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,520
It's goodbye from me.

832
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,579
Was it also very cold?

833
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,220
No.

834
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,060
It was t-shirt weather mostly.

835
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:33,220
Oh.

836
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:35,460
Sort of hovering around nine degrees.

837
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,020
Oh.

838
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:45,380
See, I was thinking, wow, that sounds really hot for Sweden in December and then John has uh recalibrated it to t shirt weather that uh you know, of a man who lives in the north of England.

839
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:50,100
I was gonna say nine degrees is not t-shirt weather, nine degrees is fleece weather.

840
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:50,660
No.

841
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:54,820
I would not put my big coat on, but it is definitely not t-shirt weather.

842
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,780
It was it wasn't shorts weather, I'll grant you that.

843
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:03,240
