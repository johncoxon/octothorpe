 Hello everyone and welcome to a very special episode of Octothorpe, the podcast for

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,720
 science fiction and science fiction fandom which is coming to you at some point in the future.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,720
 I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. Today we are talking about um

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,800
 Grass by Sherry Tepper which is a 1989 novel that was a hugo finalist.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,920
 This is the third of the three books where we picked one each and talked about them so if you

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,560
 want to go and check the other ones they were A Face Like Glass by Fraszadein which Liz picked

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,760
 and Six Wakes by Merlaffity which John picked and I knew when we were picking this I wanted to

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,080
 pick an older book and one that should be influential on me. I think Tepper was an

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,520
 influential on me her corpus of work rather than this book in particular but this book is widely

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,760
 considered to be her best novel and I remember thinking it was very good when I read it but

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,480
 because I have a terrible memory I remembered very little about it so I was very glad to revisit it.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:21,520
 This is a novel about um we are in a universe where Earth has expanded and colonized a bunch

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,520
 of planets. The Earth is being run by a religious patriarchy that is inducted to

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,560
 Mormonism and that is the model of living that they want to impart to the universe.

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,960
 We, an novel starts on the planet Grass which is what it is about um this planet is entirely

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:52,640
 covered with strange grass and we learn a little bit. We learn that um there's a hunt that is a key

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:01,360
 factor of life on this planet for the aristocracy there and that the hunt is not like earth hunts

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:10,960
 different things are going on and we discover that the earth-based um empire is being has a mysterious

20
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:20,320
 plague and a lead character and her family are shuffled off to grass to see what is going on

21
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,320
 because grass uniquely does not appear to have anyone who suffers from this plague and they are

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,880
 chosen for the trip because the they don't know very much about grass but they know that people hunt

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:44,880
 there and um uh heroine is an Olympic equestrian um champion who is also who is also aristocratic

24
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,920
 so they think that she will fit it right in spoiler not so much. Is that is that a fairly good start?

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,240
 I think that's a reasonable start. I always say the other reason they're sent is because um her

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:03,600
 husband is related to the person running the religious sect on earth. They are not members of the

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:12,880
 the controlling religious sect. They are old Catholics um but the but her husband is the nephew

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,920
 of the higher art. I didn't I don't know how important it is you mentioned Mormonism I did not

29
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,160
 think about Mormonism once when reading the novel. Is that an important thing? I don't know

30
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,440
 okay it's it's relevant that one of the things that the does Mormonism take genetics samples from

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,800
 all their followers? No it just it's the genealogy thing this is just an extension of the genealogy

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:46,320
 thing this is like do you think the Mormon church might be interested in um in having a complete

33
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,680
 genome for everybody on earth and I think they might you know. So I I didn't really know too

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,360
 as much I mean I didn't really think about it that much I guess but I didn't it wasn't screaming

35
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,320
 out to me Mormonism but I guess um there is some part of Mormon doctrine which is about the genealogy

36
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,920
 and the listing everyone so that they can be part of their part of their kind of temple

37
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,000
 and that you can baptize and you can baptize people who have died in order that they can be

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,560
 you know enter into the kingdom of God. In 2008 the Vatican issued a statement calling

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,240
 the practice known as baptism for the dead erroneous and directing Catholic diocese to keep parish

40
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,680
 records from Latter-day Saints I did not know that there enough did you not know that the Mormons

41
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,680
 did this I know why would I I don't pay any attention to Mormons at all this is your one of

42
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,800
 today's ten thousand but for bad things hmm I will never forget it quickly and there's also

43
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,840
 it turns out the Mormon Geem-Nome project having just quickly Googled so yeah they are in fact doing

44
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,800
 exact they would quite like to do exactly what what's is done in this book they just aren't yet

45
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,640
 that's a total side note maybe we should talk about the book more before we talk about Mormonism

46
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,240
 yes I think Alison should tell us why she picked it but anyway I thought that John and Liz would

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,520
 like this book or at least find it an interesting book to read that helped helped them learn something

48
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,560
 about the way that science fiction was in the late 80s. Here's this book representative of what

49
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,520
 science fiction was like in the late 80s. No it was radical and wild in the late 80s

50
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,280
 it's representative of what jolly good science fiction was like in the late 80s.

51
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,640
 One of the things I like about the book and one of the things one of the reasons why I think you're

52
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,400
 beginning preamble might have gone a little bit too too much into the plot for me was I really

53
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:45,280
 liked the sort of the way tipper slowly makes it clear that everything is not what it seems on

54
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,600
 the surface and she does that extremely well in a way that talking too much about

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:00,320
 specifics of what's different like you lose some of that I posted a question on discord what music

56
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,720
 should I listen to when listening to this book and I ended up listening to the Annihilation soundtrack

57
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,120
 and it turns out that was incredibly good choice from a vibes perspective so so yeah because it is

58
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,640
 very insidious you mentioned you mentioned the lead character was Marjorie who is who is the

59
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,040
 ambassador's wife which is weird because she has many many more things than that but she is

60
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,640
 referred to in the text as the ambassador's wife but the other kind of point of view characters are

61
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,640
 green brothers which initially reminded me of the hammer brothers from Mario which Chuck hammers

62
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,240
 at you and you have to jump on them but it turns out they're quite different.

63
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
 Do you want to explain what they are John? The hammer brothers were like coopers and they had

64
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,480
 hammers and then about halfway through the no no come on come on so the green brothers are people

65
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,920
 who have been cast out so that the central overriding church in the books is called sanctity and it

66
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,640
 sounds absolutely awful and the green brothers are um acolytes of sanctity that have been sent to

67
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:12,080
 grass to do penitence for having lost their way and we follow two of them one who has been on

68
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,760
 grass for a very long time and one called Rillaby who is new to grass and that whole side of the book

69
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,160
 I also found absolutely fascinating. Yeah so I think the other key thing to say is that the green

70
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:32,240
 brothers is there because grass has an archaeological dig which is a city from a long dead population

71
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,360
 called the Rby and I think yeah one of the one of the nice things John was saying is how she kind

72
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,360
 of slowly uncovers things but you do know right from the start that everything is super creepy and

73
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:49,200
 weird shit is going on and one of the things is that the Rby city rather than seeming to have

74
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,800
 been kind of deserted and a slow death is full of people who died quickly and horribly.

75
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,080
 I wonder how that happened. Yep yeah no it's there's a point where they're like oh there are many

76
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,160
 more mummies found in this city than in any other Rby city and you're like oh no that seems like

77
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,960
 it's going to be relevant. Yeah so this book has a bit of a horror vibe going on but I didn't find

78
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,240
 it to be as as long-time listeners will know I struggle with horror and I don't remember finding

79
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,920
 this particularly horrible at the time. We recorded this episode at the same time as episode

80
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,280
 105 and I talked about monolith in that episode and it's kind of horror in the same way that monolith

81
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,400
 is horror where it's this creepy sense that not all is as it should be and that everything is at

82
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,800
 some level awful. It's not sort of it's not sort of have nightmares at night scary it's

83
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,080
 I would not want to live in this universe scary but it does that very well that creeping sense of

84
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,280
 horror and dread is very good. What themes do we want to cover? So I think there's a few themes

85
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,760
 we've covered religion is a clear theme in the novel environmentalism ecology is a clear theme

86
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,960
 I think gender is a clear theme patriarchy and I think class is a clear theme oh and I think action

87
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,280
 is a clear theme the ability to do the right thing even when like the laws and strictures around you

88
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,680
 would suggest that it would be difficult to do so. There's also taking action versus not taking

89
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,880
 action so it's not quite the same but I mean in centibrate doors which I finished it just in time

90
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,640
 for the Hugo deadline so it's on my mind you know mother of glory says that the only way to

91
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,480
 change the world is through intentional directed violence and maybe it's not the quite same thing

92
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,800
 here but I think there is the strong you know the overt theme of when should you take action and

93
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,160
 when should you not take action even if that action is sometimes violence that you think will lead

94
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,320
 to a better outcome. I don't think it's it's a much earlier take on it and I don't think it's

95
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
 quite as clever or as interesting as it is in the centibrate doors but I think that's definitely

96
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,200
 there and all tied up with the religion and the sin. Yeah I think that's fair. Now I think I think

97
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,560
 one of the interesting things I found about this is that we are I think it's very relevant especially

98
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,520
 now in the kind of you see it in the kind of you know should you punch an artsy discourse

99
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,760
 and stuff like that like I think it is still very relevant maybe more relevant today

100
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,280
 and I think the novel kind of does some interesting things with that question and

101
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,040
 and answers in a way I found very compelling. So appeasement. There are lots of people who don't

102
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,320
 want to rock the boat and it gets in the way of doing what's right and that all kind of comes up

103
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,800
 later in the story. Do we have anything else to add on kind of action? Yeah I think it is we're saying

104
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,200
 and I think we're going to get into some spoilers for this book but not like cute ones and it is

105
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,120
 quite old so you know go out there and read it before you listen on. Yeah do you like it did you

106
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,280
 like it guys would you recommend it? I did like it yeah. You didn't ask you launched straight into

107
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:06,080
 plot summary we were talking about Mormonism but yes no it was good. So I did like it I'm not sure

108
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,880
 if I'd recommend it um and would be caveats which we'll get to. You might want some trigger warnings.

109
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,400
 Yeah exactly so to get back to this so one thing we find out later on is the kind of the arbai

110
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,840
 civilization had a like the very optimistic view of the world and that their view was like

111
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:34,080
 true evil does not exist that everyone can be improved and given second chances and this

112
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,080
 probably led to their downfall and then it becomes more of a discussion between Marjorie and some

113
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,080
 of the life on the planet as to when you should take action but I think it was interesting this

114
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,160
 sort of set up the arbai as a civilization who kind of don't believe that anything is

115
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,360
 unredeemable anyone is unredeemable and then set up some examples of potentially characters

116
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:04,720
 who are unredeemable as a contrast and also the issue of intelligent life and having an example

117
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,600
 of creatures who are intelligent but maybe not sentient and go on instinct and about the evils

118
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,040
 of that and how you should deal with that. It is really interesting that the arbai basically

119
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:25,360
 die because they can't conceive of a race that would act with malice. Their conception of

120
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,400
 intelligence is that intelligence and malice are kind of malice has no place in intelligence

121
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:38,160
 almost and it's very interesting to see the book portray this kind of dead society as a

122
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,480
 society that never really ended up being able to grapple with that so that was very interesting.

123
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,880
 I liked that a lot. The book makes that more and more explicit as you go through so it kind of

124
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,600
 sows the seeds early and then reaps what it sows later on and I guess in some ways it's also about

125
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,400
 trust, about how trust is a two way street and about how you can't abuse trust because the ending

126
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:12,800
 where sanctity is revealed in its full horror is one where the reason is overthrown is because it

127
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,920
 has abused the trust its followers have in it. They do know right from the beginning or very

128
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,280
 nearly the beginning that sanctity is awful. It's not sugar coated. No, no, no, it's not.

129
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,040
 But I think it's not in the text of the novel. It's not possible for it to end until

130
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,720
 the abuse of trust is revealed in the text. See, I thought all of that was very good. The

131
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,800
 depiction of horses, it's amazing how much of this comes from the points of the book that are

132
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,880
 from the horses points of view. I thought that was hilarious. It was like a chapter when I realized

133
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,040
 like, oh, and now we're listening to the horse. Then we get that like twice in the horse book. It's so

134
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,760
 strange. I had totally forgotten. Amongst the many things I've forgotten about this book,

135
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,360
 I, you mentioned vibes earlier and essentially all I had remembered about the book was the vibes.

136
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,040
 But I've totally forgotten that there were chapters from the point of view of the horses

137
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,880
 and having just been incredibly rude about a television series with with a

138
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,360
 it was some scenes from the point of view of the dog. I am. I did like this a lot more.

139
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,120
 I started off going, oh no, but then it was fine. It was fine. I don't think they were really

140
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,320
 necessary though. It felt like everything we were getting from the horse could have been

141
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,520
 conveyed with the human perspectives. And again, there's a chapter towards the end where she gives

142
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,320
 us like the perspective of every single human and it's like, this is very long when did just move

143
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,280
 things along. Maybe today I don't know anything about horses so I also don't know if any of the

144
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,840
 horse stuff was accurate, but I assume the horse stuff is fakie realistic, although the horses seem

145
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,520
 to be able to ride for a very long time. Horses are real. I'm here to tell you that, Liz. It's a good

146
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,600
 jump. Thank you. And this kind of the theme about doing what's right versus doing what's expected

147
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:02,400
 I think comes from the theme of gender. And so I think that segues quite nicely because

148
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:09,840
 Marjorie is in a relationship with a man who it's fair to say that they're not very well-matched.

149
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,960
 So they have a poor marriage. I thought I thought that relationship was interesting because

150
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,400
 yeah, I think it lays out like how they are not matched. And it was also interesting to have the

151
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,880
 kind of the son taking after the mother and the daughter taking after their father. And you know,

152
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,200
 there were kind of being echoes of their parents. And you can see that in kind of how they end up

153
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,040
 and what they do. I thought it was interesting that Rigo, the man who is kind of portrayed as not

154
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,960
 really listening to his wife and going off basically to prove his masculinity by joining one of these

155
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:49,280
 hunts, later ends up making a really important contribution by learning to join the hunt and

156
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,760
 being very good at riding these not horse-like malicious animals. And then that becomes like a

157
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,800
 precipitating bit of the plot. Because I was thinking that was just going to be, it would all go badly

158
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,360
 wrong and his cubers just catch up with him. And it does. But it is also kind of, he does have

159
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,240
 an effect that's quite useful when he ends up winning a fight basically. I think one of the

160
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,760
 interesting things about the book is that obviously I sympathize with Marjorie and I sympathize

161
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,760
 rather less with Rigo. But I thought the book did a pretty compelling job of characterizing both of

162
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,960
 them as people who were incompatible. And it wasn't like it wasn't that either of them were

163
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,680
 deliberately trying to do that. They were both trying to be what they needed to be for the other

164
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,880
 and both just not being able to be that person. And I thought I liked that because Marjorie at

165
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,480
 several points feels guilty that she is not able to be who Rigo needs her to be and goes to confession

166
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,200
 and her priest basically says you just need to obey him or recite the catechism of obedience.

167
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,840
 And I think that's deeply unhelpful advice. But I think the relationship itself is just sort of

168
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,800
 doomed to fail because of how different they are and how incompatible they are. And I thought that

169
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:12,720
 was very well done to give you those insights into gender and into patriarchy. But in a way that

170
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,640
 wasn't like Rigo's just like evil. I didn't like him very much, but he wasn't just a bastard.

171
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,720
 Does that make sense? Yeah, I think he is two-dimensional. And I did like that we see her going to confession

172
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,160
 and there are two Catholic priests that she can go to confession with. And we see that like one

173
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,200
 of them is obviously younger and more reasonable and maybe sticks less strictly to doctrine than

174
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,360
 the other. And she's kind of surprised when she goes and gets a different outcome by going to a

175
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,280
 different priest. Yeah, which I thought was a nice way to add a few extra dimensions to this

176
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,200
 theme of religion. In my head Marjorie is played by Rachel Weiss and Rigo is played by Oscar Isaac.

177
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,800
 That'd be fine, costing this movie. I think that would work very well.

178
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:05,760
 One also the way that gender is used in the ruling families of grass where it starts out,

179
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,880
 you sort of think, oh this is normal kind of patriarchal stuff. And then it becomes more and

180
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,920
 more clear that in fact, again, that is also not what it seems and that something much worse is

181
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:26,000
 happening in the families. Especially Sylvan, there's a point where one of the aristocrats

182
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 sons is talking to Marjorie and says, well, you know, it wouldn't, you know, it affairs a common

183
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,840
 place in our minds. And it's like, oh, that is not, that is not necessarily compatible with his image

184
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,640
 in which the ruler of the house is very patriarchal. And that's the first hint. I think that something

185
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,960
 is very different here. Do we want to dig more into gender? Because there's some nots of good

186
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,400
 stuff as well. Yeah, I mean, this is a book of its time. So the way we talk about gender and the way

187
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,560
 we talk about gender and science fiction books in particular has moved on a great deal since 1989.

188
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,000
 And I think that is relevant here. That's probably one of the things you'd want to trigger.

189
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,840
 Yes, I think, you know, I'm never keen with saying it's of its time, but it does feel definitely kind

190
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:17,920
 of of of a body of work that was happening kind of in the the 70s and 80s that is feminist

191
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,680
 but I'm trying to think I had to put this. It's it's feminist, but in a way that basically has

192
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,640
 strong female characters, but also has some female characters who exist only to show us how bad the

193
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:38,240
 men are. And it's also a very binary men, women feminism and does not have anything like the kind

194
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,800
 of gender diversity, which I think is a hallmark of more modern science fiction. So I was trying

195
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,680
 to think in the parrotist book, because what I was thinking when I was looking at this is,

196
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,520
 okay, so it was nominated for Hugo in 1990 and it lost her a Hyperion. And then in 1991,

197
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,640
 the winner of the Hugo and in 1992 as well was Lois McBashtaboojold and it's those early

198
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,560
 burial novels, the vaud game and burial, which I like but have this very strong theme of basically

199
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,360
 rape and sexual assault being something that happens to a lot of the main characters and is a way to

200
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:19,360
 kind of show that some of the men are bad. And this happens quite a lot in grass and quite a lot

201
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,040
 of the female characters seem to exist only for this to happen. And also the book, like the narration

202
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,920
 of the book is very negative about them, while also having like Marjorie who is like a female

203
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,200
 character who is basically in control of her own destiny and making her own choices. And then you

204
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,440
 know there's a female doctor who is crucial to stopping the plague later on and there are

205
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,680
 characters like this. But then there's also the characters, you know there's multiple characters

206
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:54,720
 who end up getting abducted and kind of having their brains rewired and people treat them like pets

207
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,640
 and they're sexually assaulted. And I'm thinking like, "Rigo brings his mistress to the planet" and

208
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,040
 basically no one likes her because she is shallow and she's what Rigo needs which is like an

209
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,800
 uncomplicated woman who likes being his mistress and being a catwoman and being available to him.

210
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 But basically no one likes her and she's just described as being shallow and never thinking of

211
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,800
 anything else. And oh well, she gets killed. Or possibly gets abducted and has her mind wiped,

212
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,000
 but no one really knows and no one seems to be too upset that she's dumb. Yeah so there's a lot

213
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,680
 of fringing in this novel. Yes. No I mean it's one of the things which I think is there's a lot of

214
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:47,920
 abuse both sexual and physical and it is hard to read and it is also tricky because it does that

215
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,440
 thing where well let me know if you disagree with this peeps. But I think the intention is that the

216
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,000
 I think the novel wants you to conclude that the reason that the male bonds are being quite so

217
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,600
 awful is that they are basically being mind controlled by the hippie by I'm also very reluctant

218
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,880
 to go along with any narrative that's like, "Ah well you know the men that are raping people are

219
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,920
 doing it because they're mind controlled." And it's like that gives them a lot of a...

220
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:21,600
 it's a really hard thing because it basically gives them kind of an excuse or the text wants

221
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,400
 to give them an excuse and it's like, but I don't think that's helpful to the message the novel is

222
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,480
 trying to portray. I have a lot of misgivings around that. I didn't feel it was trying entirely

223
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,560
 to absolve them. I think it was also clear that this hippie who are these like horse-like creatures on

224
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:48,640
 the planet who we discover are kind of mind controlling all the aristocrats subtly into running this

225
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,080
 hunt for their benefit. And so they are kind of under their control in a way but it didn't feel

226
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,280
 like they were... it didn't feel that was used really as an excuse for the the violence of the men

227
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,640
 in the family. And they're also kind of being sexually manipulated by the hippie as well. You know

228
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,520
 I mean I think all of the aristocrats are being manipulated by the hippie. I think that's just...

229
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,840
 I thought it was just to perpetuate the hunt. So things they do to perpetuate the hunt but maybe

230
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:27,760
 not anything else. So he beats her when it becomes clear. So um Oberman, the main... there's one

231
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,480
 Bond family which we follow more than the other. I can't remember its name. Who was his first name,

232
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:40,640
 S something solder. Stavinger von Damfald. Stavinger beats Rowena like to a bloody pulp basically.

233
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,680
 And the reason he does that is because she has given information about the hippie to Marjorie.

234
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,200
 And my inference there was that Rowena was acting against the will of the hunt and Stavinger was

235
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,880
 being used to punish her for that. But I don't like a reading where rape and abuse their wives but

236
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,680
 it's all because of alien influences trying to perpetuate this situation because I don't know...

237
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:15,120
 I would find it much more palatable if it was happening in both. If there was like some families

238
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,440
 where men were being abused and some women were being abused but I understand that I would undercut

239
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,640
 what the book is trying to do with gender but I think the abuse undercuts what the book is trying

240
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,600
 to do with gender anyway so I don't know. My feelings are very mixed. I read that as the

241
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,520
 hippie are determined to perpetuate the hunt and they are controlling sexually manipulating the

242
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:44,640
 hunters to make that happen. Stavinger is a free agent though where he's abusing his wife

243
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,680
 but it's like an alcoholic going where somebody has tried to take their vodka away.

244
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,240
 It's like an alcoholic where someone just tries to take their vodka away but also an alcoholic

245
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:01,280
 where the addiction has been foisted upon them by alien mind control and the result of the

246
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,200
 addiction when the mind control leaves is to perpetuate the alien mind control. I don't think

247
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,560
 he has much agency. That's what I'm trying to say. I don't think any of the aristocrats have much

248
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,080
 agency which I think is where they're so much more backwards than the commoners.

249
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,160
 Yeah so that there is a class thing in this book as well. Oh yeah yeah 100%.

250
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,760
 The where the aristocrats are they believe they're in charge but they're not and the

251
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,880
 commoners are busy off running the economic matters of the planet and rather leaving the

252
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,560
 hippie's great game with the aristocrats and not having any part of it but also not doing anything

253
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,280
 to stop it which comes back into that there's questions of inaction and action that

254
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,400
 they're so relevant to the book. I think a lot of the commoners just have a vague sense of unease

255
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,280
 but they mostly just think that the aristocrats are mad and nuts. Yes. Yeah I mean there is that

256
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:00,080
 I mean we do fight we do see from the start that the hippie are adopting only young women

257
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,760
 from the hunt and I think at the end when we get kind of what you know when we get the

258
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,120
 explanation of why they've been doing this there's absolutely no reason it had to be young women

259
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,680
 I don't think it could have been anyone and so the saying that has been the young women is to kind

260
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:23,360
 of I think make up a gender politics point but it's not really supported by that will text the book.

261
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,320
 So if we talk about Tepper more generally um Tepper is often seen as being somebody who is

262
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:37,440
 writing strident and polemical books and I've been thinking about this because I don't think

263
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,480
 this book is particularly one of them and whether that's true and that can occur to me that quite a

264
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,680
 lot of the books that men were writing at the time were really had quite a lot of bias in them

265
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,120
 in terms of the sorts of stories they were telling and and that there was maybe some unconscious

266
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,160
 bias there that if women were writing books they should be subtle and certainly a lot of the worst

267
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,360
 subtle and a lot of Tepper's books are not subtle and um but you know a lot of the other science

268
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,520
 fiction around at the time was not subtle either so I don't think it's fair criticism.

269
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:20,960
 With Liz's point I was also confused about and maybe I'm wrong but it seems like there's a bit

270
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,360
 of a plot hole right at the end where the hippie are abducting these young women

271
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,560
 brainwashing them like removing everything except for their sex drives which is just a choice

272
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:42,000
 and like then sending them into town naked with dead bats but as far as I can tell the first

273
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,680
 time this happens it's intercepted in town so are we supposed to assume that this has happened

274
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,120
 before that like people have successfully stowed away to spread the plague or are we supposed to

275
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,720
 assume that this is like the first time the hippie have done it and if so why now when they're about

276
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,760
 to successfully invade the village anyway I don't really get that it all it all seemed a bit odd

277
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,160
 it's a minor point like I didn't spoil my enjoyment of the book much I just I was a bit

278
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,160
 I didn't think the book had really thought that part through I didn't think that when

279
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,600
 we're starting away they just need to um big spy with the book chuck a dead bat onto the ship and

280
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,400
 run away but are they just nakedly running through town trucking something onto a ship and running

281
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:33,360
 away and no one has ever noticed yeah so I think the implication is yes see that that doesn't make

282
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,800
 any sense to me at all no but the plague also I don't think makes a lot of sense so yes so so there

283
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,840
 is a very weak speaking of things that are not so great about this book there is a kind of explanation

284
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,640
 for the play works that is not the finest moment of science fiction it feels like it's been attached

285
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,960
 to the novel in a not very useful way it would be better to just kind of hand wave over that bit

286
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,400
 that have the explanation they actually have in my view yeah I've I think that's I think that's fair

287
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,600
 I mean I very often think that explicit explanations of what's going on are overrated in science fiction

288
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,880
 though so I know I am not necessarily representative in that way it just distract me because I started

289
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,760
 thinking about enzymes oh no nine times especially in the context of this book which is all about the

290
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:28,640
 vibes up it's a book about creating a sense of a place and a world that is very alien and and when

291
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,440
 you get into but actually it all works this way here are how all the nuts and bolts fit together

292
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,680
 even if it was done well I feel like it would detract from the overall sense of the novel yeah

293
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,560
 undermines your vibes although I do quite like the thing where it turned out to be bats because

294
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,800
 just just to explain it's set up that they're hippie who I don't know if you said explicitly

295
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,560
 the hippie are these wholes like creatures who take the arest to crats out on hunts we learn

296
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,400
 only on that one of their kind of gestures of like insult is to do something which is described

297
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,120
 as kicking up dead bats and everyone just thinks it's like they're kicking the soil up then and

298
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,200
 but it turns out the reason that they do this kicking up of dead bats is because they've been

299
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,240
 using it's to spread plague throughout the galaxy for millennia so I like that sort of maybe clue

300
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,680
 was there in plain sight well tell well put on the twitters and the face books that you should

301
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,480
 read grass if you don't want to be spalled by our episode a little later class is a really

302
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,240
 interesting one because it kind of it it's done both in terms of like it's done multiple different

303
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,680
 ways and I guess it's more generic than class because it's it's power dynamics more generally

304
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:47,600
 because they do kind of aristocracy versus the the commons and then they but they also do kind of

305
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:55,520
 margery on earth going round the town where she's doing charity work but they also talk about

306
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,480
 religious hierarchy and kind of especially in sanctity and in the green brothers where there

307
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:11,280
 are multiple different cults at work within sanctity and all of them have hierarchy in ways that is

308
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,960
 perhaps not helpful to the goals of those organizations I think it's kind of about who is running things

309
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,360
 is it the people at the top who seem to be running things or is it actually someone else who's getting

310
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,800
 things done I don't know if that ties into the gender politics as well well I will also say

311
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,680
 in some ways this is very much a book of its time because it is a book that imagines that the

312
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,400
 people who seem to have the power don't have the power and it's actually the common folks that

313
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,840
 have the power and in the current discourse about like billionaires and their effects on the world

314
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,040
 it's a very retro take on on where the power lies oh I think that's true on grass but I think

315
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,960
 I think on earth thanks she absolutely has the power doesn't it yeah oh yes probably yeah I mean

316
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,600
 it's got the power on many places it's got this whole thing going on where if you are an illegal

317
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,320
 person you get shipped off to a penal colony yeah you know it's not it's not great and that's all

318
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,640
 very relevant at the moment because they're basically talking about kind of women's rights to control

319
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,560
 their body the answer to which is none there are no rights in this novel and that is very uh

320
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:23,280
 relevant at the moment very relevant today yeah so in that sense I think it does have quite a

321
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,680
 lot you know just speak to us now it's not something where you just read it as historical artifact

322
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,240
 oh no absolutely I mean the bit of the start where she's going to you know see the alleles who are

323
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,200
 you know essentially if you have a third child which is not allowed under sanctity or other

324
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,480
 children will disavow you if you you know don't disavow your third child and you'll be sent to a

325
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,960
 penal colony and you receive no medical treatment do you receive no care you receive no nothing it

326
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,280
 just feels like a maybe not even exaggerated version of the world but it was written in 1989

327
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,720
 I was just thinking about the Chinese one one-shell policy which was in effect then

328
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,720
 and probably one of the things that have formed that aspect of the novel but yeah it does feel very

329
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,680
 relevant today Alison said like you know it's not just interesting as a historical artifact and I

330
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,080
 think that's right like I would Liz said that she wouldn't necessarily recommend this to someone and

331
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,560
 I think I would I'd recommend it to them with like a trigger warning but like I did enjoy it enough

332
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,400
 that I would say to other people it is worth reading it's good I would recommend it in the

333
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,080
 same way I would recommend stuff like in the way that I actually do still recommend like those

334
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,680
 early lowest at master boot jolt or potentially some amma kaffrey which is yeah there's some really

335
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,760
 great stuff here but there is this one particularly big thing that's going to stick out that you need

336
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,400
 to be aware of I'm warned about before you read it I was just thinking about particularly big

337
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:56,240
 things sticking out um Alison just like way um I do I do always want to say I love the I love the

338
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,520
 foxen I thought they were great maybe that's because I'm a cat person and they read like cats to

339
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,800
 me but like well they're kind of described as being tiger like I think I think your reading of them

340
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,520
 as cat like is not wrong and they purr do you want to explain what the foxen are John they're

341
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,960
 sort of like cats I really hope I really hope that that's how he came out on the recording

342
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,280
 they're sort of like cats in the way that the hippie is sort of like horses aren't they

343
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:32,000
 the the the the foxen are the object of the hunts on on the planet and they are

344
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:44,880
 an intelligent species who can communicate telepathically and they are basically have decided

345
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:52,720
 or it's not clear to what extent this is true like whether it's a universal thing amongst their

346
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,080
 community or whether it's just like some people but there are definitely some of them who feel

347
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:03,040
 that it would be better if they stopped procreating and went away and um that's one of the main that's

348
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,400
 one of the other main ways in which the novel talks about this theme of kind of action versus

349
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:16,400
 inaction but the one we are kind of introduced to them through is very cute and lovely yeah well

350
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,600
 I'm really think they are they are fine when they're not being hunted down and killed by

351
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,520
 the aristocrats and the hippie hmm yeah I mean I think that that's how because they're

352
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:35,200
 introduced as as a species that needs to be eradicated but it like foxes but spoiler that's not true

353
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,880
 I mean I think there is a big thing in not mentioning when you talk about them being like cats

354
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,000
 and we all mean it's a couple of things one is that obviously they're quite scary because they

355
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,520
 are quite powerful physically powerful beings but also Marjorie has sex with one of them trigger

356
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:59,040
 warning in a weirdly written kind of mostly by illusion but you know what's going on section yeah

357
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:06,480
 so so human aliens sex trigger warning probably both consenting intelligent species definitely

358
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,400
 oh yeah there's definitely more consent there than there are in basically any other

359
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,080
 incidence of sex that's portrayed in the book there's absolutely no like human sex

360
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,600
 positivity going on is there there's only the only good thing is when you have sex with the

361
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:28,160
 cation when also I have a question for you which is do you think it is sex or do you think it's

362
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:35,200
 some sort of mind-meld thing that fox and do that humans don't really have a direct analogy to

363
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,200
 because I didn't necessarily get the impression it had much of a physical component but maybe I

364
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,840
 did not read it closely enough and of course we know that this is a thing in this world because

365
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,400
 of the thing that the hip-eye are doing to the aristocrats in the as part of the hunt yeah that's

366
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,120
 actually true there is a reading where basically the hip-eye are repeatedly raping all of the humans

367
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,240
 who hunt but in their minds the aristocrats are up for it that's right that's why they're

368
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,040
 perpetrating the hunt they really like it I don't think I got that impression from dimmities

369
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,600
 chapter I mean it's referred to as orgasm at some point right yeah it's an orgasm um yeah but

370
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:17,680
 also it's it's but dimmity doesn't know it's gonna happen and feels like ashamed and dirty

371
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,080
 no that's right sorry there's no consent at the beginning they don't they nobody is telling the

372
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,120
 kids that this is going to happen it's it's consent in the same way that if someone rapes someone and

373
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:33,040
 that person then psychologically comes to depend on their rapist they're consenting no it's definitely

374
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,960
 no no sorry if I give you any suggestions that was fine I was I was not meeting too it's clearly

375
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,840
 it's clearly very not fine but that's I I always took it that that was the same process as that

376
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,680
 as what the foxen were up to yes but I think I I guess the distinct chamtraduros I think with

377
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,200
 Marjorie is consensual and I don't think in any other time we see it it really is it's a very

378
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,560
 complicated book that has some very difficult big themes yeah sorry for that I could have given

379
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,920
 you sort of I'll pick something easier next time no I mean I enjoyed reading it um Alison did you

380
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,400
 enjoy getting to the end of this novel that you made us read I didn't quite for for complicated

381
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,080
 reasons I think I probably would have done if we'd started recording at 10 oh no I've heard of and

382
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,640
 of course I'd read it before so I did I did basically know the bare bones of the structure of the plot

383
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,360
 and but I was really I really enjoyed reading it again I mean obviously there were things that

384
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,440
 kind of had oh I've recommended these these guys at this and this scene the whole sort of doll like

385
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,840
 the empty-headed doll like stuff it's very hard to read it's it's just weird to read from this

386
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,640
 perspective in that you can have a book which is simultaneously you know both thing like it has

387
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,000
 very progressive gender politics and you know Marjorie figuring out her role in things and the kind of

388
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,480
 equality between men and women that there is in in the the commoners but then also this you know

389
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,880
 perspective basically of every man as a potential rapist oh yeah so yeah welcome to welcome to

390
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,080
 welcome to the works of Sherry Tepper yeah I mean I enjoyed reading it I mean some of the stuff I

391
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:16,320
 heard about later Sherry Tepper's like when she released the malgret's her last novel that was a

392
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,160
 Clark Award nominee I remember there being some pretty negative reviews of that so I was pleasantly

393
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,120
 surprised because I've only read one of the Sherry Tepper and Sherry Tepper and this one seems to be

394
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,120
 on the side that I would recommend to people rather than the side that I would not.

395
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,920
 In the book How to Suppress Women's Writing by Joanna Russ one of the things that happens is that

396
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,360
 after women even where women are celebrated in their lifetimes after they die their work is

397
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,680
 forgotten much faster than men of a similar stature so one of the reasons to talk about

398
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,280
 older books by women writers is to get people talking about them because I think these books

399
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,480
 all three of them, Russ raising the stones which is my favorite but I didn't want to give you the

400
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,200
 second even if it's a loosely collected series I didn't want to give you the second of the series

401
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,480
 to read and side show they're all great and and people don't talk about these books anymore

402
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,120
 they've just kind of vanished in a way that I think a lot of the male writers of similar quality

403
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,200
 people are still talking about and I don't and I think this is something that people say happens

404
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,280
 to women creators a lot so I just want to say these books are good, go read them.

405
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,800
 I mean I would say this is also an SF Masterwork which is why we can we get to read it right but

406
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,720
 it is also true if you look at the SF Masterworks they are not gender balanced.

407
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,760
 Oh I also want to say a little bit about SF Gateway so it's not just the SF Masterworks this is one

408
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,880
 of the ones in the actual Masterworks collection but SF Gateway has done a fabulous job of

409
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:58,800
 getting old SF onto ebook format so that you can go and read them go and read vast numbers of books

410
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,840
 which 20 years ago you'd have had to pay some book dealer a lot of money to get a copy of

411
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:12,560
 and SF Gateway grew out of the SF Masterworks program but yeah no the Masterworks were obviously

412
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,760
 not gender balanced but that's partly because science fiction was really not gender balanced

413
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,840
 but they could probably have done more to make the Masterworks more more diverse than they did.

414
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,440
 Well it's an ongoing project isn't it? I think the recent ones the recent ones are much yeah the

415
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,040
 more recent ones are much more balanced but yeah if you look at kind of what was available up to

416
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,880
 I don't know maybe 2000 we can look at it in a future episode maybe yeah so yeah anything else

417
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,120
 on this book or shall we wrap up that was the old thought podcast and it's goodbye from me
