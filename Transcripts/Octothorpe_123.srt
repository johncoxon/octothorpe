1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 Oh shit! Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit!

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,000
 Recording stopped.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,120
 I listened to just pour a bunch of tea on a computer I think.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
 That's definitely going in the edit.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 123rd episode of Octa Thorpe,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,600
 a podcast of science fiction and science fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 21st

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,720
 of November 2024. I'm John Coxin.

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,560
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. I should do the intro one episode just to confuse everyone.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,240
 You did Dom the Zoo Corn F-Pierso, didn't you?

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,600
 I don't remember that far back.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,440
 Right, that's fair. I remember we played with the format but yes it would be fun to play with

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,520
 the format. We don't have any letters of comment this week on account of how we're

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,040
 recording before the last episode has gone up so yeah we don't feel lonely.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,800
 So we're recording very early this week even earlier than we did last week.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,440
 On account if I'm going to trip again sorry listeners.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,600
 Oh but your last trip was amazing or all your trips amazing Liz.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,240
 Yes.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,320
 This one is a work conference so less amazing but it's in New Orleans so not bad.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,560
 I was going to say I was going to say I think less amazing is doing some work there because

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,080
 less amazing than Japan.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,200
 Yeah my work trip is Washington DC in December which is less good than New Orleans I think but

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,720
 oh you fuckers.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,000
 It's certainly colder.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
 Oh it's going.

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,680
 Oh what it is to be a working academic.

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,600
 It's so hard I just got to go to so many places so difficult.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,720
 I will say that I'm going to spend 23 hours in transit.

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
 Yeah I mean that's horrible.

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,800
 Did that for Australia it was worth it?

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,720
 Yeah I mean it will be it will be.

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,640
 I will say that I get to fly premium economy because of the travel and expenses rules.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,480
 I've never done that before so I'm excited.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,240
 Oh I'm not flying premium economy.

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,160
 I'm doing the whole thing down the back of the plane John so thank your travel rules.

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,200
 I really enjoyed my 19 and a half hour direct flight would do it again.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,760
 In the latest banana wings which dropped the other day there's a quote from Ella Parker about

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,440
 she has this fantasy of being just slightly incapacitated so she can take her bed and read

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,880
 for several months yes and and going on a very long plane journey is kind of a bit like that

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,000
 because you can just kind of consume media for 24 hours so that's quite good.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,160
 Yeah planes I mean I'm looking forward to my flights to Washington DC because I have a large

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
 number of books to read.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,240
 I knew this going in but as a clerk judge you get sent all of the books physically

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,480
 and I cut my book around in my bag all the time yeah I don't I did had not realized how much I

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,600
 didn't miss doing that.

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:06,240
 The Belfast Eastercon has opened its hotel bookings.

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,400
 To be fair they did that yeah they did that a while ago we just forgot to tell you.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
 It's time it's time to book your Eastercon hotel if you've not done so already they are in the

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,520
 Hilton but as they say there are many other hotels in the Belfast area and they have rates at some

49
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,080
 of them. There are also many other hotels in the Belfast area at which they do not have rates and

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,720
 one of those is the one I am booked into and so other people might also like to go and have a look

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,960
 at what hotels are available in Belfast.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,480
 Yes so there's a range of hotel options they vary from quite expensive to really very expensive.

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,920
 I mean that is not a dig at Belfast that is just the reality of hotels in 2024 I think

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,920
 but yes I am also staying I'm staying at the same hotel as Alison which is not a con hotel

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,800
 and Liz I know has been looking at Airbnb's.

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,400
 Yes I mean I also looked at Airbnb's in the vicinity and there are some and also bear in mind I think

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,040
 there is a based on Google Maps I think there is a pedestrian bridge into or very close to the Hilton

58
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,120
 which is not used for part of walking direction so there are some which look quite far

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,160
 but are actually a shelter walk than you'd imagine.

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,000
 Ah so like as the Bumblebee flies it is closer than it would look on the map.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,400
 Yeah it's close to the new because obviously there's some water and there's only various ways to

62
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,360
 cross the water and one of them I think is not on the map.

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
 Liz are you coming to the Belfast Eastercon?

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
 Yeah probably. Excellent.

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
 Yeah we can do what we thought live.

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
 Eastercon have announced their rate rises.

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,480
 The first rate rise to 90 pounds has already happened it took effect on the 1st of November.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,560
 Sorry we didn't tell you about that before it happened but you know sorry.

69
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,880
 And then there is going to be another rate rise to 100 pounds on the 1st of January

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,560
 and another rate rise on the door to 120 pounds.

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
 Day rates will also be available.

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,560
 The first Eastercon discount and the All Ireland rate will rise to 70 pounds on the 14th of November.

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,720
 So you will also have missed that.

74
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,160
 We have spoken before on the podcast about the way that increasing rates for Eastercon

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
 is a great deal after the initial offering rather than merely a little bit.

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,440
 Privileges are the people who can afford to buy their Eastercon membership to years in advance

77
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,160
 which is not everybody coming to Eastercon by any means.

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,480
 I kind of have a regular moan about the quality of Eastercon budgeting but my feeling is that if

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,480
 you are budgeting in the best possible way then you would set a higher rate to begin with and then

80
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,400
 have only modest rate rises subsequently.

81
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,360
 That's probably me being a slightly mean because obviously running a Belfast Eastercon is quite hard

82
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,720
 and it's an unknown quantity in quite a lot of ways so you know but we did think when the original

83
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,800
 rate was announced that it was quite low.

84
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,440
 Well I think in particular the very specific problem that Reconnect have is that they have an All Ireland

85
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,120
 price and I think it's very hard to know how many people will be joining at that rate before you

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
 start.

87
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,160
 So it might be that they're... I mean and I also don't know how you budget but it might be that

88
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,440
 you expect tons of people to join at the All Ireland rate and then even if it's a lower rate

89
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,080
 they don't and so you kind of raise all your rates or you want to keep that steady to try and let

90
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,200
 people join from Ireland who would not otherwise be able to go to Eastercon and raise the rate for

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,760
 maybe all people from the UK and the US.

92
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,720
 It's a really tricky balance and I don't know which way I would have done it but I think they have

93
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,200
 significantly more uncertainty than many Eastercons although they've all been uncertain since 2020

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,760
 and Worldcon is also an extra uncertainty because that normally brings in a bunch of people who have

95
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,000
 decided they kind of like this convention thing and let's go to the next one but I don't know how many

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,080
 of them would say go if it was in York but won't go to Belfast.

97
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,800
 I'm sure there'll be some of those but one of the things that's

98
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
 happened and we'll be talking a little bit about back to our futures later but one of the things

99
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,080
 that's happened this weekend is that I've had a couple of conversations with people whose first

100
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,840
 Worldcon was Glasgow and who are now going to the Belfast Eastercon which is quite exciting really

101
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
 and I like to know that those people exist.

102
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,000
 I think it's very good there's obviously been an influx of new people to community which is very

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,080
 good and I think obviously it's very good that there's an Eastercon Belfast because I hope that

104
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,560
 will bring more people into the community and it's also very good and I do think there's like

105
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,240
 a... the comment about privilege is an interesting one right because on the one hand

106
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,360
 it does advantage people who can afford to budget in advance to have it very cheap at the start and

107
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,720
 then raise it quite dramatically at the end but I guess the counter-argument to that is if you have

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,840
 just all the rate to be high you never like if you can't afford that high rate you just never can

109
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,000
 whereas if you have it low for a little bit at least like there's a window but like I don't know

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,120
 how that works and also I am aware that the price of a membership is not necessarily the

111
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,320
 the biggest slice of the pie when it comes to the cost of attending an Eastercon but the other

112
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,120
 thing is that even when they announced that 70 pound membership I remember them announcing it

113
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,000
 and I was like I was genuinely astounded that it was so low when they announced it and the fact that

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,800
 they're announced three rate rises in the course of six months does rather indicate that they might

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,480
 not be having a financially great time because I feel like if they were all just like tik-a-tiboo

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,640
 they wouldn't need to do that so I don't know I wonder whether they had it I think you're right

117
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,080
 that they had it far too cheap early doors and I wonder whether that was a mistake and I think

118
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,560
 ultimately we are probably entering a period of time when Eastercon memberships do need to go up

119
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,600
 because everything has gone up like there hasn't been a massive jump like levitation was a jump

120
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:48,160
 compared to the previous two and then the Belfast went back down to the conversation level and I

121
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,520
 think that was probably a mistake I think probably that was not sustainable I think they might be

122
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,560
 finding out yeah there's a real sense in which conversation was sitting on a pre-pandemic hotel

123
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,800
 contract and and I feel that that's part a big part of why our our rates could be as low as they

124
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,440
 were we knew that rates would have to rise I mean I think Farah came to talk to us about

125
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,120
 when she was planning levitation and said will people whether a higher rate and I said you know

126
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
 yes they will it'll be fine much more than they'll weather Telford I didn't say that

127
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,720
 well I think and I think actually conversation saying it's so low has made the conversation

128
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,560
 more difficult because I think part of why reconnects level is so low is because people

129
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,120
 reacted very badly to the jump with Telford and I think as a community we probably should have

130
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,240
 pitched that differently and conversation probably shouldn't have had such a low rate in order that

131
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,120
 levitations would seem less dramatic and then reconnect wouldn't feel a need to react to it

132
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,920
 I'm gonna I'm gonna say no conversation budgeted correctly and carefully and we also deliberately

133
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,280
 did not do a lot of the things that cost a lot of money the last time I ran an easter con we booked

134
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,360
 a band I've been thinking about booking bands because Glasgow didn't book any bands they just

135
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:11,120
 booked orchestras and we booked a band for for Follicon because it was a thing we could do and we

136
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,840
 came to levitation well came to do conversation and we went oh what is our events budget going to be

137
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,880
 oh people are going to be feeling poor pandemic all of that and we just want to make the convention

138
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,720
 run we are not going to have that events budget that would bring in a name band we actually did have

139
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,480
 we had some quite good events but they were basically because we got them for free or very very very

140
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,520
 cheap but we basically did not have an ends budget and and that saves you a lot of money on both

141
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:45,440
 tech and events and and so we actually made budgeting choices to keep the price down and the notion

142
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,440
 that that having budgeted correctly and run the convention at a made a reasonable amount of money

143
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,920
 that is in some way suggesting it's all right for people to go off and spend what they want

144
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,520
 want and then and then go oh but the problem here is conversation to charge a load more money

145
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,880
 that's just nonsense you were like conversation should have charged more that that that's not

146
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,080
 why he said i mean that's not what i said so that's fair but i think easter con as a whole if you have

147
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,000
 an event which is being run by the same people every year and that event went 70 70 110 everyone

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,640
 complained it would be quite natural for the next event to pick their level at 70 and i think

149
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,840
 that's probably why reconnect picked it at 70 and reconnect is now in trouble and i think what you

150
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:37,520
 probably wanted to do is do 70 90 110 and so i think it's i think it is if you look at easter con as a

151
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,520
 holistic thing rather than a sequence of warring committees there is a different logic and i agree

152
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,400
 that easter con is a sequence of warring committees but like we don't have to make every decision on

153
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:56,160
 that basis you are still making it sound like a membership rate is something that you pluck from

154
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:04,960
 thin air you don't you make oh no no i'm not i'm absolutely not you said they picked their membership

155
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:12,240
 you don't pick it from thin air they picked it from thin air job well but they didn't that's wrong

156
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,360
 i i don't know which one you you are talking about when you say they by the way because you

157
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,760
 could be referring to multiple committees i think she's talking about Belfast but i think

158
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,680
 Belfast picked their membership level because there was so much chunkering at levitation and they

159
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,880
 wanted to pick it cheaper so that they wouldn't get the the the feedback the backlash and i think

160
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,680
 that's part of if you don't condition people slowly to these sorts of changes in the financial

161
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,600
 reality of the convention then then you are going to have that backlash and if you can reduce that

162
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,000
 backlash so that people aren't as grumpy then that is good and i think as a community we did not do

163
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,880
 a good job of that i think every convention made choices which in a vacuum for that convention

164
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,680
 made a lot of sense but i think when you look at the overall trend those decisions look a bit

165
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,840
 weird because it's like well we're not all operating in a vacuum this is a series of

166
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,200
 conventions which all work together but we don't work together financially very well i don't think

167
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,160
 yeah but i mean i think i'm a little bit more than i listen on this one because imagine you'd have

168
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,200
 to here have a situation where conversation knew what tellford were aiming at in order to set it

169
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,840
 higher i think one you need to know very much kind of how much cons are going to cost before

170
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,720
 the time because it would have needed like you know i we don't know what i can't and what conversation

171
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,000
 would have known but they would have had to like know a bunch of stuff about tellford but the thing

172
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,880
 is imagine that conversation you know they knew that the next one was going to be more expensive so

173
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,160
 do they kind of set the rate at 90 so that they make a big chunk of money which sits and pass along

174
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,880
 or do they have to then set it at 90 and then say okay but we'll spend spend more money

175
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,560
 or are you saying they should end up with the same amount of money just set the initial rate higher

176
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,760
 and and not raise it i mean i think i think it's tricky i'm not saying anything about the budgets

177
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,560
 which i think is what might be confusing i'm saying stuff about the consumer perception to

178
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,960
 increasing price of events over time yeah and i don't disagree with you on that one but i can't

179
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,800
 see a way in which you mitigate this that doesn't involve conversation setting their rate artificially

180
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,800
 high and they prefer to make choices not to do that the so the first thing is the hospitality

181
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,760
 industry is also about to take another big hit um they've already they're getting hammered in the

182
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,240
 budget and things are going to be even worse so i don't think we're going to see this improving

183
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,920
 anytime soon i think we do have to accept east coast is going to get more expensive

184
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,600
 feel comfortable to set a much higher starting rate it will be fine um levitation also set a

185
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,640
 low starting rate and only then increased a lot it so it did the same trick where the people who

186
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,760
 were in the know can get their tickets and i'd have money can get their tickets early yes um the

187
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:59,040
 other thing i thought about was i i go to a folk club sometimes and about 50 years ago the people

188
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,720
 who ran the precursors of this folk club said the ticket the price for a ticket to see the band on

189
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,440
 the folk club night should be about the same as two pints of ale because you know you'd have two

190
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,600
 pints of ale you buy your ticket so that would be about right and and what we've got to is that the

191
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,560
 price of an easter con membership is now way less than the price of even a single night in the hotel

192
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,720
 and that seems to me to be quite low if you're likely to go to an easter con and have three or

193
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,080
 four nights at a hotel then it doesn't seem to be unreasonable the the cost of the convention is

194
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,040
 about the same as one of those nights you know and and so so that's kind of the starting of a place

195
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,760
 where you might look and say oh yes a hotel room a membership but yes easter cons are expensive

196
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,400
 they've always been expensive you know the conventions are expensive except for back to our futures

197
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,040
 which is not expensive yeah i think i think that's it basically if prices are going up you have to be

198
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,280
 prepared to put your prices higher and then when people say well your prices are you say because

199
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,120
 that's how much it costs for things because everything is much more expensive now especially in the

200
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,160
 hospitality industry where all of our costs are incurred as you just said yeah and the last thing

201
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,440
 i'll say is that you know i think we connect our pains to say look we have our main hotel but look

202
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,200
 there are other hotels around which are much cheaper than our extremely high hotel rate but

203
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,680
 for the people who have no choice to be in that hotel because they need to be close to the con

204
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,280
 it doesn't matter if they're paying an extra 20 pounds a night at an extra 20 pounds from membership

205
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,640
 because they're going to be paying hundreds pounds more for a hotel room than say i would have to pay

206
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,200
 so that i think is a much bigger thing anyway and even without sorry even without having

207
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,520
 tired hotel rooms i think you still need to think a little bit about what your main hotel

208
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,400
 price is and whether they're any that are very very close by part of this comes from so alla

209
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,360
 some mentioned that levitation also says it's opening rate low and the reason we did that was

210
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,520
 because we had known so obviously e-sicon committees talked to each other we knew that

211
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,320
 conversation was going for 70 pounds and we knew we couldn't do the budget we actually needed to do

212
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,960
 immediately because we knew people would already be angry it was so much higher

213
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,520
 and we knew we couldn't do it properly at the level we actually needed it and that

214
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,000
 kind of ties into the thing i saying right at the beginning which is if we assume that the cost

215
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,880
 of this is going up and it seems to be going up like it might be that this is a blip and it's

216
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,200
 going to return back to where it was but i don't think so and i think alla says point about the

217
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,160
 budget is a good one where i think it's going to get more expensive not less in the imminent future

218
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,800
 if we accept that then that i think implies that the membership over the sort of decade from 2020

219
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,920
 onwards is going to be a straight line going up at some gradient and i just want easter cons to

220
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,320
 make that gradient a gradient rather than a sort of series of big jumps and then plateaus

221
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,000
 because i think that makes it easier for everyone to see the shape of what's happening

222
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,520
 and it comes as less of a shock and i think i don't mean to disparage any individual convention

223
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,920
 for making decisions that made sense in their budget i just think for a very high level

224
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,360
 perspective i want the membership to be able to see that shape and not be surprised when that

225
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,800
 shape is like i don't want that shape to be unpredictable because i think that doesn't work well for

226
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,000
 our members and our community and that's the point i'm trying to make i want i want people to understand

227
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,200
 what's happening which part of the reason we're having this discussion now i think yeah that's right

228
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,800
 but i think every convention does make the decisions they have to make in their own budget

229
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,760
 and like i'm not it's hard running conventions especially budgeting conventions is difficult

230
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,360
 yeah i think every other time i've run an easter con we've put the rate up and explained why

231
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,400
 because easter con because this pressure to keep the membership artificially low is is

232
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,560
 absolutely real hmm yeah and especially to have a very low rate so i i go to a lot of festivals

233
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,560
 and they have early bird rates which are maybe 10 or 20 pounds less than the eventual rate

234
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,600
 and then you get to easter con where the where it could be like 40 or 50 or 60 pounds between

235
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,600
 the starting rate and the flatness feeling the bit off i went to an academic sorry academic conference

236
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,720
 space whether it was like space by the conference and the early bird rate was 260 and the rate if

237
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,960
 you registered four weeks before was 360 and the rate on the door was 460 and because i missed the

238
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,880
 first jump i was like i was just not going then because it's not worth the money like and i was

239
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,120
 like i do wonder the other thing is if your jumps are high enough i do wonder how many people are

240
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,400
 like oh well i missed the early bird so i'm just not gonna go because it feels like it's not value

241
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,240
 for money if you did and that is another part of the psychology which is very tricky i mean i think

242
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,200
 there was an enormous amount of money in the bank at the point where conversation started and i think

243
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,040
 if we had budgeted to make because we did make a surplus as well as all the parcel long right i

244
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,160
 think if we made a significantly larger surplus than that people would have started nobody got

245
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,360
 upset with the amount of surplus we made but people would have got seriously upset if if we had made

246
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,720
 a lot more than that and that's the disadvantage of not having a central east con body but let's not

247
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,040
 have that argument now i know we can have that argument another time but i feel like we'd be there

248
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,640
 many times we are getting to the point where we'll have to the um they're closing up the sorts of

249
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,200
 bank accounts we use and things like that so it's gonna be it's gonna be very very hard

250
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,680
 we've touched on this before but we didn't have a central east con body but what we did have

251
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,840
 was a set of past along that would get you out if you made a horrendous you know if you had made a

252
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,640
 horrendous misjudgment in your price and you ended up down a few thousand pounds on what you needed

253
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,360
 we had a past along that would get us through it when we don't have that you've got to be a lot

254
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,440
 more cautious about your rates yeah that's that's the other problem no no past along

255
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,520
 got nothing to talk about this week guys it's terrible

256
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:51,440
 Seattle also announced hotels they are also expensive are they more expensive than Belfast

257
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,160
 oh yes yeah but you can put four people in a room yes we could if Liz was coming Liz are you

258
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:05,760
 coming to Seattle no boo yeah you could if we were coming are you coming to Seattle no boo

259
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,720
 you see I went on holiday and I only have a finite amount of annual leave jump I know it

260
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,240
 sucks doesn't it as of as of may we will have an infinite amount of annual leave or rather

261
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,080
 only 365 days of it yeah yeah my parents are retired and they keep saying things like oh I

262
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,720
 just forget what day it is and I want I just oh my goodness it's so smug it's so smug I am not

263
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,240
 retired and but I do work for myself and can pick exactly my own hours and um and that will continue

264
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,440
 we're going to go to Ocapellicon which is something I might mention on the podcast we have joined

265
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,000
 we haven't done any of the other stuff about sorting out the speaking of 23-hour transit times

266
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,800
 to the Aland Islands but I'm hoping it will be quite nice and a nice place to be like the end of

267
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,320
 June which is also my 60th birthday start 23-hour transit to the island islands I hope not there's

268
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,120
 an airport if you go by ferry which we're not going to do we're going to fly the take a ferry

269
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 yeah you could fly to Stockholm and take ferry right is that what you think that's the plan

270
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,960
 yeah either Stockholm or Helsinki but probably Stockholm Helsinki doesn't have ferries

271
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
 Helsinki does have ferries I mean it doesn't have ferries to the island I'm going to go

272
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,840
 double check this one to make sure I have not completely made this up so I got to the Helsinki

273
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,920
 World Con by taking a ferry from Stockholm to Helsinki which went through the Orland Island

274
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,040
 but I don't know whether it does it but I don't know I confess I don't know whether it does stop

275
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,160
 both ways oh it does know okay oh no I'm talking nonsense it does have one it's just that that

276
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,720
 is overnight the Stockholm one's better because it's during the day so you can do like looking out

277
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,440
 over the I look like the archipelago and stuff and it's good I was gonna say you can go from

278
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,960
 from Toku instead and that will do it yeah I mean there's also an airport on the island

279
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,560
 it's dinky it's the smallest airport I've ever been in but there isn't an airport

280
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,880
 Liz can tell us if she's going to archipelacon too I am not because as we have previously discussed

281
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,040
 our E.C.F.T.L. Wilcons I have a finite amount of annual leave and it does not cover the amount

282
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,400
 I would need to get back and go to Finland but I am a bit sad because I went to archipelacon

283
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,440
 one and it was great this is one of the reasons I'm going to archipelacon too is that not you

284
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,520
 were not the only person who said it was a fabulous convention it is I just we have a finite amount of

285
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:22,240
 we have the annual leave the problem is the money yeah yeah we have the annual leave and we sort of

286
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,360
 have the money but we only kind of have a finite amount of money for the whole of the rest of our

287
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,160
 lives so we we need to kind of spread it out a bit now and also I'm going to go to I'm going to go

288
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,560
 to L.A.Con so I feel like I can do a different thing and have a year off from WELCOME.

289
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,960
 On the subject of WELCOME and conventions we have been running back to our futures this weekend

290
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,440
 which is an online convention where we watch all the catch up from Glasgow and talk about it

291
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,080
 I say all the catch up it's not all the catch up on account of how there was quite a lot of catch

292
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,920
 up but yeah and we're going to talk a little bit about the stuff we've seen and whether we thought

293
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,800
 it was good we did mostly think it was good I want to talk I didn't want to talk about the actual

294
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,720
 content of back to our futures so much except for um it was the Glasgow program turns out to

295
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:18,000
 have been really pretty good well done Liz and crew um and especially when people gave a little

296
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,560
 thought to curating some things out of it and saying here it's a program slot you could you

297
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,920
 could go to two items or you can do anything else you like but here are two things we think you might

298
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:35,520
 like and everyone seems to have really liked all of the things in those item slots yeah I went to

299
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,920
 some panels I went to the opening ceremony which I kind of had to because I was on it

300
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:48,000
 and then I went to writing Future Scotland which was good very good I did a team quiz and when

301
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,600
 Liz answered the questions she messaged me to say John because she did not like one of the

302
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,720
 connections between the answers or maybe she did like it so much she wanted to pay me a

303
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,600
 compliment no one knows all right I will not you know reveal which one of those it was we

304
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,720
 as may decide for themselves reveal reveal your secrets Liz it wasn't the first one John

305
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,280
 or it wasn't the second one uh you didn't like it you did like it yeah my ton of voice would be

306
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:26,880
 John okay that's why I was attempting to convey through all caps then I went to the

307
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,880
 the mathematics of games fairies in fantasy literature the nitty ochora four panel and from

308
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,120
 Antarctica to space and then there was a gin tasting and I had rather a lot of gin and was

309
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,560
 quite squiffy oh I tasted a lot of gin and it was all terrible I didn't have any good gin in the

310
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,520
 house because apparently when we have good gin in the house we drink gin and when we have bad

311
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,200
 gin in the house we drink other things I realized but we drank quite a lot of our bad gin and we

312
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:02,320
 also drank some some good gin liqueur which we had forgotten that we had and yeah no gin gin good

313
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,640
 but I got to bed at a very sensible time there may be not as sensible as some people have you

314
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:15,920
 seen any cat chup at Glasgow Liz um I have independently I went back and watched the dark room oh which is

315
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,400
 good I mean it is the dark room but it does have some good you know gags about welcome yeah it does

316
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,880
 and I just want to buy John Robertson like infinite supplies of like honey and lemon

317
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,720
 I think he's gonna need them I think he's a performer who is not taking good care of his throat

318
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,960
 I think he's got very good I mean he's very good performer and I'm sure he's very good at

319
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,200
 projection but I do feel a little bit like oh I wanted you to just have a sit down and not talk

320
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,560
 for an hour and maybe have some like throat sweeties um yeah so that was great um I've started

321
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,160
 watching the tip tree play which I think is on back to our futures for later but I will not be there

322
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,120
 so yeah that's but that's actually it's all I've watched I feel I'm not a person who sits down and

323
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,280
 puts a panel on I think that's partly because mostly they are not visually interesting I think if

324
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,440
 they were all as a bunch of podcasts and an RSS feed I could download and listen to I would be

325
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,400
 more likely to do some catch up and future world cons take note because that's something you can

326
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:22,320
 just do because I treat catch up in general like podcasts as in I put it on while I am working

327
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,800
 especially panels I mean there are obviously some more visual items that I do watch but the

328
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,680
 majority of Glasgow stuff I have put on and treated as podcasts and then I have also watched some of

329
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,560
 the program this weekend but about half of the things that were recommended that are on our schedule

330
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,880
 I've already watched so so that was it was quite nice to know that I have actually been

331
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,920
 getting through it because I've been working quite hard on on program I felt stung by the

332
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,440
 suggestion that I never go to program at conventions and so I am taking great use of where where

333
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,760
 conventions have replay programs I am watching as much program as anyone might reasonably watch

334
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,240
 in the weekend just afterwards I like program perfectly well as long as I don't have other

335
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,120
 things I could be doing one of the things I've always sort of wanted I keep meaning to volunteer

336
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,800
 to program at conventions and keep not doing but it would I think when we did the punctuations I

337
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,800
 did because obviously we had the access to the replay videos so the ones that were on replay I

338
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,040
 just hived the audio off and put on my podcast app and just listened to them while running and

339
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:29,120
 that was very good and I don't know the obviously the problem is that podcasts are publicly available

340
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,640
 and then if you want to make them privately available I guess that there's work involved there and I

341
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,040
 don't really have an idea for how much work that is I mean it might be very little work and it might

342
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,400
 be very a lot work and I have literally no clue which way you'd jump but yeah I think it is the

343
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,440
 sort of thing that I would very much enjoy being able to do but also I don't know how many people

344
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,040
 would like I know I would is that enough to make it worth the effort no one knows I mean we know

345
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,280
 that people listen to podcasts right it'll be the same crew as the crew who listen to podcasts who

346
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,120
 would like this yeah I think I think it is I think it is much work because it basically has to be

347
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,920
 an individual URL basically I think the way people normally do podcasts which have

348
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:17,520
 memberships is to give you like a special RSS feed right yeah but some places have one per person

349
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,120
 and that is a lot more work but we could just have one and put it behind the paywall in the same way

350
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,960
 that we've done back to our futures because back to our futures is just all tucked behind the Glasgow

351
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,040
 paywall yes but I don't think you can have an RSS feed for podcasts took behind the paywall that

352
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:42,000
 I can't email to someone it doesn't matter but yes it potentially it potentially does because if

353
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,160
 you tell people your audio video is only available to Glasgow members and then you put it somewhere

354
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,520
 it isn't then 99 cent the time you'll be fine and 1 cent of the time you won't be and then you've

355
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,520
 got a problem this ties into something else that I've been thinking about which is that jondie berry

356
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,360
 said in a place I'm not supposed to talk about but I don't think you'll like this if you do mind

357
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:09,360
 John I'm very sorry that he speaks at a type conference every year and they hold the they hold

358
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,840
 replay for the members for a certain amount of time and then they just pushed all on YouTube and

359
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,960
 I said well what we did this was one of the punctuations we actually asked people about replay in

360
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,880
 YouTube's and public YouTube separately and presumably you could actually ask those permissions at

361
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,800
 WILCON and then just dump everything on YouTube at the end of the replay period at which point

362
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:35,200
 you could also make these are a public RSS feed and the answer I got was that you can do that but

363
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,560
 you could do that in theory but Planarama didn't have the permission so I've put this as a very vague

364
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:47,520
 feature request in the in the Vay in the fandom development discord but I feel like that model

365
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,160
 where you hold the stuff for a certain amount of time for members and then where people have

366
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,120
 previously given permission you then dump it into a public space at the end of that time which is

367
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,880
 also what we're using for the Taffa Guff reports now and that's a really good model because actually

368
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,200
 there's there's infinite amounts of stuff on the internet and really people don't often want to

369
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,920
 look at stuff at the six months old but sometimes they might yes that would be fine but my point

370
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,240
 was Glasgow did not ask permission to do that so they can't no no no Glasgow clearly can't do that

371
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,200
 this is this is I'm not saying Glasgow do this I'm saying future conventions have a think about this

372
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,400
 also we were talking about the great cost of conventions and I'm going to say that

373
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,360
 back to our futures obviously Glasgow was quite expensive to put on back to our futures have

374
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:37,840
 been extremely cheap both to have make happen and to attend and I still think there's space for some

375
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,320
 online conventions in the mix because they are very cheap and can be accessible to a lot of people

376
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,760
 who couldn't necessarily get to a physical convention yeah but back to our futures a terrible example

377
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,240
 of that right because there's a reason about our futures is cheap which is you haven't generated

378
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,960
 any content I mean you generate you have generated a small amount of content but you know how dare

379
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,400
 you Liz I wrote 25 quiz questions at least five of which made you make a noise I think you can still

380
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,080
 do this but what I'm saying is back to our futures is basically building off a half million pound

381
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,680
 you know turnover convention it is I have another but however I have another idea for an online

382
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,360
 convention which is that you could do this but instead of getting your program from Glasgow you

383
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,880
 get your program from the internet and you basically curate stuff that's already out there as say

384
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,080
 we're going to watch these fabulous things in the world one of the things so Nicholas Jackson

385
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,280
 gave a talk on the mathematics of games which I really liked but oh you have to you have to have

386
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,360
 a head for maths like he is not he is not like walking you slowly through maths on that one

387
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,560
 like the equations come thick and fast and those equations are made in LaTeX I watched that a

388
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:50,320
 couple of days ago and I was like oh this I know two thirds of the stuff in this already and the

389
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,600
 third that I don't know is very interesting and I really enjoy this and it is great and yes I

390
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,440
 was like oh it's it's it's it's proper game theory it's good but I will say is so the reason I bring

391
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,040
 that up is that he mentioned a talk that was given as the hey lecture the other year by a

392
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,520
 mathematician and someone pointed out that that talk has been given at a different event where they

393
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,240
 did put it on YouTube so like I think Alison is on something here where there are like

394
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,400
 fanist style program things that you could cobble something out of now the question is

395
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,880
 if you build it do they come I don't know the answer to that yes because not that many people

396
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,720
 I mean we've got about we've got about 160 people have joined the discord something like four

397
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,920
 back to our futures and quite a lot of people have come in but not all at once very often so we've

398
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,400
 typically had about between probably 30 or 40 engaging with the program a lot of the time and

399
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,600
 and I mean that's small I it's enough but I would like to it would be twice the size so I'll know

400
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,160
 that for next time I mean we kind of we kind of didn't publicize this very much for fear of getting

401
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:00,160
 a thousand so yeah we could we could on our current setup we could have it have had it be two or three

402
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:06,480
 times the size it is and also in the pandemic large zooms were a thing that happened and like

403
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,600
 you just had to basically be okay with that but outside the pandemic I've forgotten how much I

404
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,560
 hate big zooms like I find it really difficult to work out when I can join a conversation without

405
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:25,520
 interrupting and when I'm welcome to talk and stuff and like above about five people I just

406
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,720
 start finding it completely isolating and lonely and so yeah there is an element there which is

407
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,040
 in the pandemic this was much better than nothing but outside the pandemic it's much worse than

408
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:44,800
 being at a convention and that is hard I think I have enjoyed this weekend very greatly but yeah

409
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,040
 I think it is interesting going back to that kind of pandemic mode of discourse and being like oh oh oh

410
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,800
 I think I could have done with setting up more rooms that were kind of maximum four maximum six

411
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,480
 maximum eight I can do that of course but I think now it's probably a next time thing

412
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,200
 a lot of the time it's been fine it's just sometimes there's a huge bunch of people in one room and

413
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,080
 it's quite hard that we still haven't solved that problem of how to organically split a group in a

414
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,040
 bar that is too big into two groups that are the right size that just happens naturally in bars

415
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,720
 but never happens at all in zoom there's also been another welcome bit announced and it is a bid for

416
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:30,000
 Edmonton in 2030 hey I've always wanted to go to Edmonton I would like to go to Canada be nice

417
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,480
 yeah so there's basically just an announcement saying we are going to do an Edmonton bid

418
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,440
 and a blue sky account and then further details will be forthcoming this is one of your you know

419
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,800
 placeholders for the future things yeah that placeholder has a very strong graphic design

420
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,320
 I was very pleased to see this it has very strong graphic design and also they have four grounded

421
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,400
 the name used for Edmonton by the indigenous people of Canada because we later named it Edmonton

422
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,960
 and that is a nice thing to see upfront on your big materials and this is something that came up

423
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,680
 on the fame fantasy panel was a discussion about indigenous people was because Jo Walton was offered

424
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,720
 basically she was asked if she wanted to write a sequel to among others and she was like financially

425
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,960
 that would bring quite a good idea so I looked at like how I could do it and she was like basically

426
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,600
 there are two options which is do the do the thing like what if it's in a different country or do

427
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,320
 the thing in space now I will go on the record of saying I want to read the sequel to among among

428
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,240
 others sell on the moon like she talked about it he sounded cracking I would be well up for it

429
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,880
 Jo I assume you don't listen but if you do I'm in a friend of Jo let her know tell her to listen

430
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:44,320
 John will buy one copy yeah you will you will get one sale but she talked about like you know

431
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,040
 one of the other obvious things you could do is just like well what would this look like in the

432
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,560
 States and then she was like but I don't want to erase the indigenous peoples like own kind of

433
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,840
 fantastical cultures and heritages by transplanting like the British fantastical on it to erase the

434
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,840
 indigenous fantastical and I think they're a really fascinating thing but I'd love to see

435
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:11,520
 I'm kind of hoping that if this convention is selected they would have like some really

436
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,560
 interesting stuff on indigenous science fiction and fantasy and I think that would be really really

437
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,400
 interesting Belfast Easton has Ruecke Rowan horses a guest of honor and obviously there is a

438
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,080
 consideration there is you could probably do some quite good intersectional program about

439
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:34,080
 English colonialism of the fantastic in Ireland and in the States and do some interesting

440
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,760
 crossovers there so I'm hoping that there'll be some interesting panels about that

441
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:51,040
 shall we do picks I guess so all right who wants to pick first I'll pick they've got a book a pick

442
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:59,120
 it's a book oh this is going to surprise zero listeners but I read a book by Robert Jackson

443
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:06,560
 Bennett and it was great and I'm going to pick it uh-huh I know I've become predictable but the book

444
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:13,200
 is called Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennett it is yet another brilliant fantasy world um it's

445
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:21,920
 basically an empire where giant leviathans are real and in the rainy season they will basically

446
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,800
 need to be stopped from destroying the outlying areas of the empire um and also all the magic is

447
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,760
 magic where you engineer plants anyway it's great and it also kind of sets up this very

448
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:41,520
 this class structure where there's obviously a big military who are there to defeat the leviathans

449
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,560
 you have this structure where living in the inside of the empire is more desirable because if you

450
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,480
 live in outside provinces there's a possibility that a giant whale will come and destroy you oh and

451
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,760
 also people are magically altered to have things like say a perfect memory so our main characters are

452
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:07,840
 Anna who is an investigator of mysteries and she is investigating a murder through her assistant

453
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,840
 Dinh, Dinh has a perfect memory Anna basically does not leave the house and sends Dinh out to do

454
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,720
 all the investigating with his perfect memory and then come back and relate to her what he sees

455
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,600
 and I think the best review I've seen is stealing a sort of good news from goodreads

456
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,560
 approach from the Hugo Girl people the review is it's like knives out but if knives out was set

457
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,560
 to fancy world and Benoit Blanc was an old woman who had hired the most disaster bisexual to be

458
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:40,320
 her eyes and ears thank you Robin on goodreads yeah and it is I would say it is a bit more plotty

459
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,320
 and so rid of the books a bit less character driven because it is both a great fancy world

460
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,720
 and a good murder mystery and it feels like a nice well-paced murder mystery where things come out

461
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,200
 you know at the right time to be a surprise and yeah I just sort of devoured it in a day

462
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,680
 well that sounds awesome the other the other thing I think it's probably in conversation with is the

463
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:08,000
 Lincoln Rime novels by Jeffrey Deaver in which the main character is paraplegic and has a

464
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,240
 detective who does the crime scene work for them so yeah it sounds interesting I love those books

465
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,200
 so I shall look it up I just I do like Robert Jackson Bennett and I need to read more of it so

466
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,760
 thank you for the recommendation is it going to be like Adrian Shekoski where the person

467
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,080
 writes faster than I read books thank you right it's about one book a year I think you can manage

468
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,040
 that very normal I could definitely read one Robert Jackson Bennett book a year he's very good

469
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,000
 oh Liz you have an Adrian Shekoski scoop well it's not it's not really a scoop so much as I read

470
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,520
 Amazon is it mmm mmm there's a cancer scoop yeah basically I'm reading I'm reading an

471
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,240
 agent Shekoski book as I do quite often so I'm reading House of Open Wounds so I went to add

472
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,120
 Days of Shattered Faith his next book in the series to my Amazon wishlist and I saw there was a fourth

473
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,200
 book listed and I couldn't find any information about it on the internet so I did what everyone

474
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,520
 does which is I skated at the author to say oh what's going on and he said it's an

475
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,040
 avilla-length book in the same world so there you go is that a scoop yeah it's quite exciting

476
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,240
 I presume at some point is going to be announced and someone accidentally put it on the Amazon

477
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,280
 listing Adrian right rather than skipp forget from Amazon well I found the name on Amazon because

478
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,040
 someone had uploaded it to the listing so it's not like it's a secret but then I probably the only

479
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:30,640
 person who's gone oh what's going on here doing so far so I am picking Time Stalker which is a

480
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,760
 small indie movie it is written and directed on stars the comedian Alice Lowe and it's sort of a

481
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,520
 comedy and it's got some funny bits which has also got some really not funny bits which is kind of

482
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,960
 how comedy works these days I guess but I really really like to tell the premise of the movie is

483
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:56,720
 that Alice Lowe has a absolutely disastrous obsession crush on someone that is so completely all

484
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,640
 encompassing that she goes through Time repeatedly in order to declare her passion for this man who

485
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,760
 is then completely oblivious and that bit is very funny and then she dies horribly so there's a bit

486
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,720
 of gore in it Stephen was like I do not understand why this film is so gory but it is just cartoon

487
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,560
 violence it's not very gory in the in the great scheme of things and I thought it had a lot of

488
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,120
 very interesting things to say and this is made up on a budget of about £2.50 and it doesn't

489
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,600
 entirely work but apart from that it's really really good and I liked it and would recommend it

490
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,200
 and you will have to look quite hard to find it because we had to go to Hackney Pitch House to

491
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,720
 see this film we could not see it in a Waltham state this was trailed before the substance when we

492
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,840
 didn't see the substance and I have it has been on my list but it did leave all of the cinemas near us

493
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,400
 before we could get to it but I'm a huge fan of Alice Lowe because she was in

494
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,000
 Goveringay's Dark Place among other things horrible histories is the other thing and also

495
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,920
 the film just looked absolutely mad so I was like very down it's absolutely bananas it's bananas yeah

496
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,880
 because I came in and I was like this doesn't make any sense it also includes John's favourite

497
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,600
 Mike Wozniak so you know John's excited about that who just might Wozniak play in this movie he plays

498
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:19,040
 Dan I'm gonna suggest it's not a big role but yeah I want to see it very much and I will be excited

499
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,200
 when it comes to streaming because as well as Alice Lowe going back and forth through history

500
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,960
 several of the other characters do which is almost it's not immediately obvious whether that's a

501
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:36,320
 deliberate artistic choice or whether it's much cheaper if all of your main characters take

502
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,800
 several parts rather than having to recast in time but I think it is a bit of a bit of a

503
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,520
 bit of a bit of a bit of a choice so there is so that sets up this question of whether Alice

504
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,000
 is really going through time or if it is all in her head which it could be and there's kind of a

505
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,240
 telling scene where she gets some therapy for this which is a fairly sensible therapy I think

506
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:01,920
 and I it's a very strange movie I did like it a lot I'm gonna pick a role-playing game so I've been

507
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:10,400
 playing in a campaign of a role-playing game called Roth and Glory which is a Warhammer 40,000 role-playing

508
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:21,280
 game by Cubicle 7 Games and this is a D6 based system and it's very good and the reason I'm

509
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,520
 gonna pick it is because it does something cool with its dice mechanic where you have a thing called

510
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,640
 the Wrath Dice you basically in every time you roll you roll a number of D6s and you're looking

511
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,600
 for basically successes on your D6s but the Wrath Dice if it rolls a six or a one something weird

512
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,480
 happens or like something very bad or very good happens and I've seen this kind of mechanic before

513
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,640
 in a role-playing game called Genesis which is the underpinning for the most recent Star Wars RPG

514
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,120
 and I really like games that make you think about what's going on beyond the immediate

515
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,240
 success or fail of the thing you've said you're doing and this system does that encourages you

516
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,640
 to think about the wider context of your actions without needing like a bunch of specialist dice

517
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,680
 and so yeah I've been enjoying it very much the other thing I quite like about this game is that

518
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,440
 when you're going to combat you're basically paying miniature games of Warhammer 40,000 and

519
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,640
 the people I'm playing with are very nerdy so they have all the little toy soldiers and I get to

520
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,800
 move the round the map and I'm like I remember this from when I was an undergraduate it was very fun

521
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,320
 I have no desire to go back into collecting Warhammer 40,000 on account of how I have to pay my mortgage

522
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:33,520
 but yeah I'm very much enjoying playing this and and I would recommend it to any role players out

523
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,880
 there especially role players who fancy some grim darkness yeah I hear what you're saying

524
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,120
 there about little toy soldiers and it's a it's a hugely consuming hobby that people spend tens of

525
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:51,360
 thousands of pounds on I'm always slightly amazed by it but I'm sure but the people who do it should

526
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,360
 do it I'm sure they're having fun it's one of those things that seems expensive until you work

527
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,680
 at how much time you're spending playing and then it seems a lot less expensive like board games

528
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:06,560
 much more expensive than book and also I'm not sure some of them spend a lot of time playing but

529
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,640
 a lot of them just spend a lot of time kind of painting and organizing and looking at their little

530
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:20,320
 toy soldiers painting is also a hobby time spent painting is fun it is well an unless you hate

531
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,360
 painting in which case it's not that was the art thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's

532
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,560
 goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

533
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:47,760
 [Music]

534
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:55,840
 recording in progress hey Alison how's it going I know sorry guys

535
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:03,440
 not well so so I was basically sitting chatting away while I noticed and then suddenly I noticed

536
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,320
 this weird slightly increasing pool of brown liquid yeah Liz Liz I think called it behind my

537
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:18,000
 eye found did any get into a computer um I believe I have a I have a three pin British plug here

538
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,400
 that just had some coffee spilled on it but I believe our plugs are very safe and I have

539
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,400
 a plastic container that holds a battery and I don't think any will have got inside the plastic

540
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,080
 containers to get all the battery because it's a it's a battery for a insta 360 and they're pretty

541
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,560
 I mean it is this is a reminder that I should probably have tidied up this nest a bit better

542
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,560
 but in fact it's fine the main the main problem is that my lovely lovely flat white from the lovely

543
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:52,800
 lovely coffee shop is much reduced but it was it only got through a hole that size in the top of

544
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,440
