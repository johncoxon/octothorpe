1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:08,600
You could just put it on Git or something and we could all simultaneously edit it and push it back.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,700
Yes! The best!

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,200
We should have a Git repo for the show notes. Absolutely.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,620
I love that.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,820
That's hilarious.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,800
Because we're not actually a tech podcast.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,260
I just feel that sharing text files on the internet should be simpler than this.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,280
I mean, I feel like your computer shouldn't be haunted, Alison, but like, we work with what we've got.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,380
My computer honestly isn't haunted.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,320
I mean, none of the evidence supports that perspective.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,940
Definitely haunted.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:01,920
Hello everyone and welcome to the very eighth episode of the Octothorpe podcast, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,020
I'm John Coxon.

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,460
I'm Alison Scott.

15
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,700
And I'm Liz Batty.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,060
And we have a raft of letters of comment this week.

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,020
We're very sorry.

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:23,020
We did not correctly set up our email forwarding and that means that we had inadvertently ignored all emails for the last two months.

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,840
So, we've got a lot to talk about.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,020
And thanks very much to listener Claire Briley of Croydon, who pointed this out to us helpfully.

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,020
Also, when you say we failed to set up our email, John.

22
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,380
I'm blaming John.

23
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,280
I mean, to be fair, none of us checked and we probably should have done.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,500
It's true.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,360
I probably should not just blame John.

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,420
We can leave that bit out.

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,060
I will not blame John personally for our rudeness.

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,160
But for other things.

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,740
It's probably mostly my fault.

30
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,020
Right then.

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,180
So, from the top.

32
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:04,520
Our first email of comment was on the 13th of April 2020, which at the time of recording is two months and four days ago.

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,780
And it is from one Andrew January of Reading.

34
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,260
And he says that he came across a website that does special video chat.

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,180
And you move around in a 2D space.

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,840
And as you get near people, you can have group video chats with them.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:35,240
And it lets you kind of treat a big group gathering on the internet as a kind of space rather than just a kind of set of rooms as in Zoom or a set of channels as in Discord.

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,800
He doesn't mention what the name of the website was.

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,380
We did talk about something a little bit similar to this last episode, which was Kala.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,860
But yeah, that sounds cool.

41
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,320
Wouldn't it be cool if it was 3D and you could do it in VR on your VR headset?

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,460
That would be awesome.

43
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,480
I have been very sad to not discover.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,940
I was expecting to go into the Oculus store and find all manner of VR experiences of this kind.

45
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,020
But they don't appear to exist yet.

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,220
I don't really want to spend an entire evening with my VR headset on, much as I love it.

47
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,760
It's quite heavy and not entirely conducive.

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,480
And it would be hard to, like, drink.

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,220
One of the things I do on these Zoom chats is drink.

50
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,400
And I cannot drink and play Oculus Quest at the same time.

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,380
I would need to drink my beer with a straw.

52
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,460
And, you know, there, that gets you.

53
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,880
I think we did on a previous podcast.

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,320
I think Liz suggested one of those beer hats.

55
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,540
I was going to suggest that again because it's such a good idea.

56
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,980
A VR headset with integrated beer hat.

57
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,820
I may need one of these.

58
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,580
Yes.

59
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,140
I'm going to be a billionaire.

60
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,080
If Andrew has seen this thing, has he actually seen it used for a large event?

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,540
Because I feel like there's a number of people saying, well, there's a proof of concept of these things.

62
00:03:52,540 --> 00:04:02,640
But I'm not sure to what extent they actually exist and also whether they're actually being used for large events or whether they're just kind of tech demos.

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm also slightly worried that the problem we've talked about before, that it's relatively easy in a physical conversation to say, this is amazing, but I absolutely have to go to the loo now,

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:30,700
is much harder in these video conferencing chats and it can be hard to just kind of slip off the edge of one of them without people kind of noticing, especially if they then see from their VR environment that you're engaged in conversation with more interesting people across the room.

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,980
Differently interesting.

66
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,860
It's a good save.

67
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:41,400
It's, I suppose, hard to hide at the other end of the bar when it's a 2D space with no hiding places.

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,820
But I've done, I've done kind of abrupt goodbyes from Zoom calls and people don't seem to have been too offended.

69
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,960
So I don't, I don't know.

70
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,560
I think people are usually pretty chill about, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like people are pretty chill about that kind of thing.

71
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:05,440
Right, on to letter of comment two.

72
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,240
So this is from Mark Olson on the 25th of April, 2020.

73
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,520
And he says that he stumbled across us and listened to our first podcast, which he enjoyed.

74
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,820
But he does say that he thinks we might want to mention the date because he did not read it.

75
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,520
Sorry.

76
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,480
He did not listen to it close to the time of recording.

77
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,840
And so some of it didn't make a lot of sense.

78
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,020
And if you remember, episode one, we had not fully gone into lockdown yet.

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,860
So a lot of it was immediately rendered quite dated.

80
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,720
Today is Wednesday, the 17th of June, 2020.

81
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
It is.

82
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,940
And this show will probably be going out on the 24th of June, I don't guess.

83
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,740
Oh yes, we're recording early.

84
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,220
That's kind of showing behind the curtain, isn't it?

85
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,180
It is.

86
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,440
It is indeed.

87
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,420
But yeah, we were talking in episode one about the lack of a written constitution for Eastercon.

88
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,940
And he mentions the Lunarians, which were New York fandom.

89
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,460
And I did not appreciate this.

90
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:18,620
But because of a series of very, very rigidly defined rules in the club constitution,

91
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,800
the club was invalid because they had not sent notice of elections,

92
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,260
which meant the old officers' terms had expired.

93
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,060
The new officers had been improperly elected because the notices had not been sent out.

94
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,680
And so there were no officers.

95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,780
There was no secretary.

96
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,420
So there was no one who could send out a notice of any elections.

97
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,080
And so there could never be any new officers.

98
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,460
And therefore the club stopped.

99
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,200
And this was a club with fewer than 20 people, all of whom saw each other frequently.

100
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,600
So there is a sort of risk in having rigorously defined systems,

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,260
which is if you don't have the imagination to foresee the way in which the system could go wrong,

102
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,320
you can end up painting yourself into rather a corner.

103
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,400
The problem was solved by forming a new club called Lunarians 2.0.

104
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,880
And that failed because they couldn't agree about who they would let into the new club.

105
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,460
So it stopped.

106
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,780
I have thoughts about this, which will come later in the episode,

107
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,620
with regards to the Worcestershire Business Meeting this year.

108
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,460
But it is a cautionary tale and one I would encourage people to listen to.

109
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,800
I particularly liked his phrase of the club was, what did he say?

110
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,020
The club accumulated noxious dead wood.

111
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:40,640
And I wouldn't like to comment as to whether that applies to the World Science Fiction Society.

112
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,420
This just feels a bit like, you know, when I have an account on a website somewhere

113
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,300
and then I forget my password and forget to update the email address

114
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,380
and basically just have to make a new account all over again.

115
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:56,080
Just keep making new clubs called Lunarians 2.0, 3.0, 3.14, whatever you like.

116
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,720
Just go for it.

117
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
Yes, there's a good way of dealing with it, I think.

118
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,220
I think there's a spectrum of fandom and you can tell which end I'm on.

119
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,220
Yeah, the east end.

120
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,960
Well, I mean, I've always been on the spectrum of fandom that said we shouldn't really organise anything.

121
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,300
And I mean, we can organise stuff in the sense of making things happen.

122
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,420
It's just the point where you decide that it's easier to make things happen with a written constitution.

123
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,440
I'm always slightly sceptical about because in my experience,

124
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,720
things of that kind tend to be used in order to prevent things from happening rather than making them happen.

125
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:41,640
And anyone who is a co-host on the Octothought podcast will know how true it is that Alison is opposed to formal organisation of things.

126
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,040
That's harsh.

127
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,660
It is harsh. I don't regret it, but it is harsh.

128
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,880
To be fair, when John got in touch and said,

129
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,540
are you interested in doing a podcast? I did warn him about this at that exact point.

130
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,920
I knew what I was getting into. It's true.

131
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,400
Mark also wrote to us to comment on later episodes.

132
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:11,880
So he said that he thought our point about fandom doing virtual socialising from day one was quite perspective

133
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:20,280
and commented on our talking about the first Thursday and then talked about Con Zealand.

134
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:32,720
And he is, I think, quite sceptical of Con Zealand because he isn't convinced that you can have a time zone

135
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,100
which sufficiently sort of encompasses everyone who needs to be encompassed

136
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,800
because you need to encompass kind of traditional world con fandom in the US,

137
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,160
but also you need to encompass New Zealand fandom, obviously,

138
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,680
because it's a New Zealand con and so on.

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,540
And he also says that he's sceptical of having programming for such a thing

140
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,640
because you need to have enough programme that you can call it a world con,

141
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
but not so much programming.

142
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,920
If you have a level of programming that won't tire people out,

143
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,780
it will feel like a much smaller con.

144
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,180
And he basically concludes by saying this, that he's not criticising Con Zealand's competence.

145
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,800
He's just not sure that it's a workable proposition in any way.

146
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,000
I think since he wrote that stuff like Balticon has happened,

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,680
which has shown that you can, I think, get around some of those problems quite well.

148
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,240
But it's an interesting take as to kind of at what point do you sort of change things

149
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,460
enough to make it workable online to the point where it doesn't really feel as big as a world con should anymore.

150
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:47,600
Yes, I think a lot of the points Mark raises have possibly been addressed by other virtual conventions in the meantime.

151
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,540
So if Mark is not too upset with us for failing to read his emails in a timely fashion and he has any updates,

152
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,300
we'd love to hear them.

153
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,220
Yeah, definitely.

154
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,060
And I think you can cat-hurt.

155
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,320
I mean, we can cat-hurt panellists to showing up in the right rooms at the right time,

156
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,040
just about, and in the case of the Eastercon, usually by bribing them with a free beer if they'd like that.

157
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,800
So I'm sure you can get them to show up for the right Zoom.

158
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,780
You might just need a team of Zoom wranglers.

159
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:20,080
Yes, and send beer sort of to panellists through various delivery services.

160
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,320
And I also think about the Hugos, I think part of the problem with the Hugos is you do have this tension

161
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,220
between providing the best experience for people in the room and also providing a good experience for people

162
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,020
watching online at home.

163
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,920
And possibly if you're only trying to do one of those things at once, it will simplify things eventually.

164
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,080
That is fair.

165
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,000
That's a good point.

166
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,180
Alison, do you have anything you'd like to say?

167
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,320
I've promised to myself I'm going to be quieter this week.

168
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,100
I mean, firstly, episode title, so that's great.

169
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,240
Secondly, we like you talking.

170
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,120
It's a key part of our shtick is that we talk.

171
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:10,060
But actually, I feel I've probably said all I've got to say about Con Zealand

172
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:17,600
until I see the draft programme and their draft plans for social space, at which point I expect

173
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,760
to have enormous amounts to say.

174
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,580
So I am holding my fire on that.

175
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:31,100
But I did like his final thing saying that we seemed very reasonable and are we sure we're fans?

176
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,540
Yes, that did make me chuckle.

177
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,600
I liked that.

178
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
We've definitely disproved that in subsequent episodes, haven't we?

179
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,280
Yep, yep.

180
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:52,540
Well, we've proven our lack of reasonability both in terms of having had very wide-ranging opinions

181
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:59,820
on future episodes, but also by having not done a reasonable job of reading letters of comment.

182
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,380
So we've neatly put ourselves straight back into the fan category.

183
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,020
Also, I will say I edited out all of the really acrimonious bits, obviously.

184
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,300
So it's very easy to be reasonable when you can edit out the arguments afterwards.

185
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,980
Yes, I was going to say, I meant to say it's clearly, we're clearly reasonable in the edit.

186
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:34,240
Andrew Hogg sent us an email on the 19th of May, and he was worried that we're mispronouncing

187
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,920
Claire Briley of Corrigan's surname, because he remembers hearing it differently while watching

188
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,580
a stream of the 2011 Hugo Awards, and wouldn't want any of us to be embarrassed publicly by getting

189
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:44,980
it wrong.

190
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,160
I am 99% certain we are pronouncing Claire Briley's surname correctly.

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,860
Because I have been harangued on that matter on many times, on many occasions.

192
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,400
When I gave Claire her Hugo Award, I pronounced her surname incorrectly.

193
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:07,020
And so if I ever win my own Hugo Award, my entire acceptance speech will just be to say

194
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,240
her name correctly, and then moonwalk off the stage.

195
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,500
Can you moonwalk?

196
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,320
No, I'm going to have to learn to moonwalk.

197
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,440
Okay, so you better get practising then, hadn't you?

198
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm not going to win a Hugo, Alison, so I'm not sure it's going to come up.

199
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,300
Are you a Hugo finalist?

200
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:27,360
I am, as mentioned by Mark Plummer in his letter of comment from the 23rd of May 2020, which

201
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,500
is addressed dear Alison Liz and Hugo Award finalist, the boy Coxon.

202
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,980
Dr. Hugo Award finalist, the boy Coxon.

203
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,340
That's me.

204
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,220
That is you.

205
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,760
And so he says he's enjoying the Octothorpe podcast, which is good.

206
00:14:44,420 --> 00:15:01,140
And he also asked whether or not we could give ourselves names as according to the style of the kids TV show Octonauts, in which they're a character called Vegemoles, which are half animal and half vegetable.

207
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,980
Hence, tunip is half tuna, half turnip.

208
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,580
And carprica is half carp and half paprika.

209
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,500
So tell me about Octothorpe.

210
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:08,680
Octonauts.

211
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:08,680
Octonauts.

212
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,600
I know nothing of this.

213
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,240
It's a children's programme about basically a crew of underwater explorers who are all animals.

214
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,340
And they go on, they have like, they have like a set of vehicles, a bit like Thunderbirds.

215
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
Nice.

216
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,100
And then they go on adventures.

217
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,640
And I haven't really watched it in that much detail, but apparently it is like scientifically accurate about all its underwater adventures.

218
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,060
And they also, for some reason, have these things which are half animal, half vegetable.

219
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,080
And all their names are like a, you know, mashup of the two names.

220
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,040
So, what's a good one?

221
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,180
Albachoy is half bok choy, half albacore.

222
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,780
According to Wikipedia anyway.

223
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,840
It's good, isn't it?

224
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,920
Ten out of ten.

225
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,640
I could be hadtato.

226
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,620
Half haddock, half potato.

227
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,200
That's pretty good.

228
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah.

229
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,500
I was proud.

230
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,840
Or, hmm.

231
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,540
Try to think what my favourite, my favourite fish is definitely haddock.

232
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,320
But what's my favourite vegetable?

233
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,520
Courgette.

234
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,540
Hadette.

235
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,680
Hadette.

236
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,480
Um, yeah.

237
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,920
So, is that good?

238
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,240
I think that's pretty good.

239
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,860
Are we limited to vegetables only or can we have fruit?

240
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,140
No, it's vegetables only, isn't it?

241
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,660
Hmm.

242
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,200
But it does say animals.

243
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,620
It doesn't necessarily say it has to be fish.

244
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,040
That's true, but I mean.

245
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,460
Just both of the examples of fish.

246
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,780
Generally, the theme of the show is fish related.

247
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:41,400
I've only seen like snippets of Octonauts when babysitting children who loved Octonauts.

248
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,540
That is fair.

249
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:49,320
I have never seen any Octonauts, but feel I should now go and look them up.

250
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,340
Maybe we should have a special episode next week.

251
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,720
About Octonauts.

252
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,760
And I'm going to be a crab to choke.

253
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,720
Yes.

254
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,760
Nailed it.

255
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,900
Oh, great name.

256
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,100
That is a flimmy great name.

257
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,940
Love it.

258
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,520
Okay.

259
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,840
Straight in the show.

260
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,140
But Alison, have you got a Octonauts name?

261
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,120
I have been thinking about this.

262
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,260
I may have to return to you next week.

263
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,240
But in the meantime, I quite like moose rot, which is a combination of a moose and a carrot.

264
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,440
Hmm.

265
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,660
I like that.

266
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,700
But when I first thought that, it said a combination of an animal and a vegetable.

267
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,940
And I was like, oh, you mean like salmon and sushi rice.

268
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,600
But I think I may have been missing the point there.

269
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,540
Also, neither of those is a vegetable.

270
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,960
Sushi rice is definitely a vegetable.

271
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,160
Is rice as a vegetable?

272
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,920
Yeah.

273
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,220
It's not meat.

274
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,660
I mean, it's as much of a vegetable as paprika.

275
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,860
Paprika is a pepper.

276
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,600
Chili pepper.

277
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,480
Paprika?

278
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,080
Paprika.

279
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,140
One of those is a chili pepper.

280
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,160
Plus, we are getting that off Wikipedia.

281
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,280
I'm not sure if that is a fully canonical Octonauts name.

282
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,100
Andrew Hogg asked, is there a piece of media you waited over a decade for and it actually lived up to expectations?

283
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,800
Um, yeah.

284
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,300
Which is such a good question that I think we should bring it back at a future episode.

285
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,780
Not least because I've got a hook to tie it to one of the Hugo nominated fancasts.

286
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,140
Oh, hello.

287
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,720
Interesting.

288
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,960
Which talks about books that haven't come out yet, which is not, is kind of irritating.

289
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,780
But they were saying that Susanna Clarke's Piranesi lives up to expectations.

290
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,260
There is nothing like Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell.

291
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:40,000
And he also says he's looking forward to further updates on LOF, the Liz Only fan fund.

292
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:48,580
It's not clear to me whether this is only for visiting Liz, whether this is only for Liz to visit or both.

293
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,540
But, yeah.

294
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,760
Got to get that going.

295
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,640
I think this is a follow up to our previous discussion where I threatened to send you a map and point out where Australia was, if you recall.

296
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,160
It could well be.

297
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,480
I'm basically my own, you know, fan fund zone for now.

298
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,980
Ha ha ha ha ha!

299
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:16,480
And Mark very kindly described Octothorpe as similar to listening, sitting in the bar, listening to the three of you having a conversation and being unable to get a word in edgeways.

300
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

301
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,480
It's not untrue.

302
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,820
To which he said, Alison will add, so exactly like that then.

303
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,080
Ha ha ha ha ha!

304
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:37,300
And also I will say that Claire has mentioned a similar sentiment to me, but she says she always wins the arguments she has with us because we can't answer back to her witty repartee.

305
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,820
So this is actually a feature rather than a bug, I feel.

306
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:47,720
If you want to have the last word, just mutter under your breath as you listen and it will go well.

307
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,780
I thought that was a huge benefit of podcasts generally.

308
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,500
I mean, I'm forever shouting at podcasts.

309
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,340
And now you shout during them, as do we all.

310
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:10,760
Another man called Joseph Norton sent me an email to the podcast email address thanking me for putting MP3s of the vinyl albums of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on my website,

311
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,940
which I did ages and ages ago because I have the vinyl albums and they're different to the original radio series.

312
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:26,400
So I recorded them from my dad's turntable using some audio recording software on a laptop.

313
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,220
And then because no one else had put them online, I thought, well, you know, no one's going to lose out.

314
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,880
Since then, there has been a vinyl release of Hitchhiker's, but I think it is a vinyl release of the BBC show.

315
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,320
I don't think it's a vinyl release of the original vinyl albums.

316
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,320
But yes, so he said thank you and you're welcome, Joseph.

317
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,960
Glad you're enjoying them.

318
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,600
And thanks for listening to the podcast.

319
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,120
It's nice that we have listeners who aren't actually already our personal friends.

320
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:02,840
It's not, it's actually not 100% clear to me whether he listens to the podcast or whether he found the podcast by googling my name.

321
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,520
Either one, that's an outcome.

322
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,780
That is an outcome.

323
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,280
Because I mean, there is so, I mean, he might have found your professional work.

324
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,980
He might have found your Hugo finalist things, you know.

325
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,320
Yeah.

326
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,020
You have a wide internet footprint.

327
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:24,020
Then we have Claire's.

328
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,280
Claire Briarley.

329
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,600
Get me.

330
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,640
I can pronounce it now.

331
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,120
And her letter of comment.

332
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,320
Does any, do either of you want to go through that?

333
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,220
You mean, would you like me to do some summarising?

334
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,600
Because you've done quite a lot of summarising on this podcast already.

335
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,380
I'm worried the listeners will be very bored of my voice.

336
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,140
Yes.

337
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,700
So Claire sent us a letter, having caught up with episodes six and seven.

338
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,320
Wishing all the best to John's microphone, which is no longer unwell.

339
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,640
And revealing she has drunk a beer called Edgelord.

340
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,120
She does not reveal whether she knew the meaning of the name of the beer at that time.

341
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:07,660
She's also asked if Stow Shirts make a grumpy old fart cap for Worldcon X Division heads.

342
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,100
Anything can be, things can be arranged.

343
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,880
They do now.

344
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,040
Anything can be arranged with Stow Shirts.

345
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,020
So Claire is.

346
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,580
Pretty much.

347
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:25,340
We discussed briefly, I think, this is how you lose the time war, which I think I had read and you guys had not read, correct?

348
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,620
Not yet.

349
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,740
Still haven't.

350
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,780
Still not read it.

351
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,760
It is on my iPad waiting.

352
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,440
It's very nice because I enjoyed it and thought it was good, but it did not speak to my heart.

353
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:46,340
Claire's written in because it did speak to her heart about the love story and about finding people and how truly distinct that is from sex and or friendship.

354
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:58,040
And also recommended the books by Nick Bantock called Griffin and Sabine, which I have never read, but I might look into because they're apparently a reminder of this is how you lose a time war.

355
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,620
Yeah, I'm looking forward to reading it because I have obviously heard an awful lot about it at this point.

356
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:13,280
I'm currently reading the Becky Chambers one, which I do not remember the name of.

357
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,780
I think it's To Be Taught If Fortunate.

358
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,740
To Be Taught If Fortunate.

359
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:32,020
And the reason I'm currently reading that is that because in the Hugo voter packet it only came as a PDF and I currently have a e-book version on loan from the library so I can read in a slightly nicer format, but I have to read it first.

360
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:39,500
But after that I shall probably do the rest of the novellas, so I will hopefully have listened to it by next time.

361
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm sure nobody with any influence in these matters ever reads this, but I have taken the view that if your submission to the Hugo voter packet only comes in PDF format, then I will deprioritise it in my Hugo reading.

362
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:01,620
And seeing as I never managed to get all the Hugo reading done anyway, this means that you are less likely to get my vote.

363
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:18,620
I am sure I'm not the only person, but I thought I wanted to say this publicly so that the people out there who make the decision to put these things in as PDFs know that it's not actually as efficient as putting things in as e-pubs or any other e-book format.

364
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:28,000
And if you're doing it because you're worried that people will pirate the e-book, then you're being a bit silly because obviously the PDF is sufficient for people to be able to do that.

365
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,920
Anyway, I know that this has no effect, but I just kind of want to shout into the void occasionally.

366
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,560
Yeah, that's fair.

367
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:50,280
No, and I will say I do agree with you in that if a book is only available in a format that I don't, that I find stressful to read, or if a book is not available in full, then I'll try and read it.

368
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,580
I'll try and borrow it from the library.

369
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:59,140
But if the book doesn't come through by the time the deadline happens, then yeah, that will mean I don't vote for it.

370
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,020
Last year that was The Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Cole, but then that won.

371
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:13,080
So I'm not sure that my failure to read it in time really affected it meaningfully at all.

372
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,960
It was a fantastic book.

373
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,500
Thoroughly enjoyed it.

374
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,600
Think it deserved to win.

375
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,560
Did not read it until after the ceremony because that was when my library hold came through.

376
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,420
I know it's really never up to the authors, is it?

377
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:36,180
It's decisions made at a publisher level, so I don't know to what extent that could be helped.

378
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:47,340
I agree with Alison entirely on the PDF thing, but I also read 100 pages of The Calculating Stars and decided, nope, and put it down and read something else.

379
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,220
Not every book has to be for everyone.

380
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:58,600
No, and I felt quite pleased myself for reading it and going, no, this is not my thing.

381
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,620
I'm putting it down and reading another book.

382
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,680
And I was on a reading holiday at the time, so there were probably several hundred other books around for me to choose from.

383
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:24,220
Did anyone write to us suggesting things that we could read or do to improve our awareness of Black Lives Matter and related issues, John?

384
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,940
No.

385
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,860
Have either of you done anything to enhance your awareness of your white privilege?

386
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,840
Yes.

387
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,600
I have read Superior by Angela Saini, and that was very good.

388
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:46,540
I think that it helped me see kind of some of the issues around ethnicity as a kind of categorisation system.

389
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:58,040
And I read it while on strike as part of the Black in the Ivory slash Black Lives in STEM strikes, which happened a week or two ago now.

390
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,160
I've also bought How to Be an Anti-Racist by Ibromex Kendi.

391
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,220
And also looking forward to reading that, but I have not yet read it.

392
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:20,240
I've also started monthly donations to a couple of other organisations that were on the Google sheet of organisations that we had in last week's show notes.

393
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,480
So that's what I did since last time.

394
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,760
Either of you do anything?

395
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:33,640
I put a load of books on my hold list for my local library, which were all extremely popular and will no doubt come through in about November.

396
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,920
But I mean, they will come through and I will then read them.

397
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,620
I listened to some podcasts by black creators.

398
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:47,220
The one I enjoyed most is called Nerds of Prey and hasn't actually had a new episode out since December.

399
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,780
So I'm not entirely sure I want to mention it specifically.

400
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:59,240
I liked some other ones, but they're more in my kind of normal tech and scientific niches rather than science fiction and fantasy ones.

401
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,260
I'm still looking for some recommendations there.

402
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:12,580
And I also donated some money to charities that work with disadvantaged people and with legal defence for people in the UK.

403
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:28,520
So my recommendation would be there is a list posted by Sirens Conference, which runs every year in the US, have posted a list of 50 works by black authors, which I am basically working my way through.

404
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,740
I've read some of them, some of them going on my wish list.

405
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,520
A couple of which I actually owned and will be now coming to the top of my reading list.

406
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:49,700
I am making an effort to read more books by black authors and buy more books by black authors, especially over the next couple of weeks, as I think there was a drive to try and buy them in a particular week and thus bring them to the top of the bestseller lists.

407
00:28:49,700 --> 00:29:00,100
So I read The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead, which is not science fictional, but is another spectacular novel from him.

408
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:13,140
Quite a harrowing read about two young black men in a juvenile facility in the US in the 1960s, which is great.

409
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:26,760
Like John, I'm also an academic, so I'm reading a lot of the black in the ivory stories about the experiences of black academics and trying to think of ways that we can help in this area.

410
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,560
And I have also donated to some organisations from the list we put in the show notes last week.

411
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,900
Claire also sent me, she sent, I think, many people a short fanzine about Weetabix.

412
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,860
She didn't just send a short fanzine about Weetabix, she sent Weetabix. Have you not had your Weetabix yet?

413
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,980
I have had my Weetabix, but I don't want to talk.

414
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,680
What?

415
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,860
I have also had my Weetabix.

416
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,380
Oh, she sent you Weetabix as well.

417
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,820
There was a picture of an entire carrier bag full of Weetabix.

418
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:10,360
I don't know to whom Weetabix was sent, but I think it was a large operation.

419
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,760
I think I may have failed to, because obviously I got a Weetabix because I had sent Weetabix.

420
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,320
Yes.

421
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,160
My Weetabix arrived completely unharmed, but it did not go large letter.

422
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:28,380
I think the question of how you get a Weetabix through at large letter rate without harming it is still an open one.

423
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:35,060
That presumably means that you'll have a Weetabix impounded by Thai customs at some point, Liz.

424
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:44,980
I don't believe Claire has sent me a Weetabix, if only because she's not at any point asked for my post address in order to send me a Weetabix.

425
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:53,280
So unless she somehow intuited my address, or she decided to just put Weetabix care of Lizbathy, Thailand, hopefully they have not impounded a Weetabix.

426
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,240
Has anyone tried just sending a Weetabix to Claire Briley Fishlifter Towers Croydon and seeing if it arrived?

427
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,520
It might arrive.

428
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,760
The Royal Mail can really surprise you.

429
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,360
And Claire Briley, I assume, is not a terrifically common name.

430
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:25,220
Right, so if you work for the Royal Mail and you find a package in 50 years when you listen back to this historical record that looks to be some fossilised Weetabix, now you know where it came from.

431
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,160
Fossilised Weetabix looks exactly like Weetabix.

432
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:46,620
Well, I will say, and I also will say, that I did, in response to her fanzine about Weetabix, implore her to write three more fanzines about Weetabix so I could nominate them for Best Fanzine at the Hugo Awards, which I think would be brilliant.

433
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,360
I'm not super hopeful it would win, but I'd definitely nominate it.

434
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,180
I think we should be going for a new category, Best Fanzine about Weetabix.

435
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,320
Start the process!

436
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:09,980
On the subject of Wusfus procedures...

437
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,800
Have we now finished follow-up, John?

438
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,500
We have finished follow-up, Alison.

439
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:25,920
Some of you may be aware that Con Zealand is being held online this year, but this is not stopping the World Science Fiction Society holding a physical business meeting in Wellington,

440
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:32,080
because, according to File 770, and I quote, it cannot be moved online.

441
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,440
What do I think about that, peeps?

442
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,780
The Octothorpe rant.

443
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,500
See, we've got a new show segment name.

444
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,620
He he he.

445
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,320
Why can it not be moved online?

446
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,480
Like, I have not delved into the Wusfus constitution for a little while.

447
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,440
So I can't remember what the exact wording is.

448
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,860
Is it that we literally can't move online because something says you cannot do it online?

449
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,700
Or is it that we can't move online because there's not a way of doing all the things the business meeting needs to do online?

450
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,120
Or it's some other reason?

451
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:09,820
It's possible that we cannot do it online because Wusfus has a brush up its collective arse.

452
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:23,900
So here we're in a world where the UK Parliament, Mother of Parliaments, run by Erskine May since the beginning of time, manages to move itself online in a couple of weeks.

453
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,300
Just by basically going, huh, does it make sense to not do this?

454
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,120
No, it does not.

455
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,100
Let's go online.

456
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:40,220
Whereas Wusfus, run by, as we know, Robert's Rules of Order, goes, oh, no, we have to have a physical meeting in the location specified.

457
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,600
Because, I mean, if Wellington was bombed, what would they have done?

458
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:56,520
You know, I mean, you can see them going, oh, it's ground zero, but we have to be there because the Wusfus Constitution requires us to be there to hold our physical business meeting.

459
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,020
And there is no other way to do it.

460
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,700
And the Worldcon will come down around our ears if we do not hold a physical meeting.

461
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,240
Now, there is another argument that says, actually, you know, we could have brought it online.

462
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:18,160
But in fact, having a micro meeting on site is the sensible way forward, because otherwise every rules lawyer in Wusfus would just...

463
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:28,580
I'm trying to think of a metaphor here that's not extremely sexist and a bit dodgy over the prospect of arguing about this for three solid years.

464
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,220
Right.

465
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,380
Anyway, that's all I had to say on the subject.

466
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,600
How does that relate to...

467
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,900
How does that compare to your rants?

468
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,740
I don't know.

469
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,500
It can...

470
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,860
It depends how passionate I am about the rant.

471
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,560
As far as I can tell, and I am...

472
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,460
I am interpreting a constitution and I am not a lawyer.

473
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:56,460
And to be honest, you'd need to be a lawyer to appreciate all of the nuances and subtleties of the Wusfus Constitution.

474
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:14,260
But as far as I can tell, the problem is Article 5, Section 5.1, Subsection 5, which states that the quorum for the business meeting shall be 12 members of the society physically present.

475
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,460
Now, I have double-checked, and as far as I can tell, the word physically is not actually defined anywhere in the Constitution.

476
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:30,480
So I assume that they're relying on a definition according to the dictionary.

477
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,800
And my dictionary defines physically as...

478
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,800
In a way that relates to the real world and things perceived through the senses as opposed to the mind.

479
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:48,580
So, I would argue that if you wanted to, and you had the mental gymnastics present, you could interpret that to allow an online meeting.

480
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,340
As long as everyone was at the online meeting and you could see them with your senses.

481
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,580
But perhaps there would be a point of order raised and people would get very frowny.

482
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:03,240
It does also say in the Constitution that any member of the Worldcon should be allowed to attend the meeting.

483
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:13,860
So I'm also sort of tempted to arrange some sort of splinter group where we all threaten to attend the meeting in strict contravention of international law unless they don't hold it.

484
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,620
And I wonder what they would do then.

485
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,440
But yeah, it's ludicrous.

486
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:26,840
And it comes down to the point made earlier in the episode about if you have a set of rules that is sufficiently rigorous,

487
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,880
that it does not permit for certain things that may go wrong to go wrong,

488
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:41,320
then those rules can end up with silly situations like having a situation where 12 people have to meet in Wellington to have the business meeting.

489
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,440
And I would argue that if it does have to be held at the Worldcon and the Worldcon is in cyberspace,

490
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,120
a physical business meeting in Wellington is in contravention of the Worcester's Constitution and should be immediately disallowed.

491
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,500
I'm genuinely like, this Constitution does not provide for this circumstance,

492
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,940
so you've got to do some imaginative reading of the rules.

493
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,800
But given that you have to do some imaginative reading of the rules,

494
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:08,760
why on earth not imaginatively read the rules to allow a virtual business meeting that we could actually attend and participate in?

495
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,160
This is the end of my rant.

496
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,620
Because they don't wanna.

497
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,040
Because they think it would be too hard.

498
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:23,240
I feel that the Eastercon managed to make this happen perfectly adequately.

499
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,760
And that it doesn't seem...

500
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,040
I mean, obviously we did it without the benefit of a constitution or rules of engagement.

501
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,920
We just did sensible stuff in a way that was kind of quite English of us.

502
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,200
You know, I don't feel that they've necessarily taken the best option.

503
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,340
And there's clearly nothing to stop them having a meeting in which people join physically,

504
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:56,960
but the meeting is also online and people can make comments and suggestions online using some form of Q&A system.

505
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,760
I feel that with rules lawyering like that, John, you have a great future ahead of you at the Worcester's business meeting.

506
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,180
You take that back, Batty!

507
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,840
How do you feel about mornings?

508
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,120
I mean, I am...

509
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,920
I don't like that the fact that the business meeting is held at the Worldcon because it means I can't go to panels or the bar.

510
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,900
And to my mind, the exciting things about Worldcon are panels and the bar.

511
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:32,440
So I guess I have less ranty opinions, which are mostly just because I'm, I think, less bothered.

512
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,380
I'm OK with them deciding this year, OK, we can't do a virtual one.

513
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,220
And it says we should have an actual physical gathering of 12 people.

514
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,720
So let's have a physical gathering of 12 people to the absolute minimum and punt this to next year.

515
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:55,400
But I do think next year needs to be thinking about this now and working out how they will do a virtual business meeting if necessary,

516
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,980
or if not, how they can put in place all the structures in 2021 to enable us to do this in the future,

517
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,720
because we don't know when this might happen again.

518
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,760
But 2021 is a good bet.

519
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,940
For being online or for...

520
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,220
For when it might happen again.

521
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,000
I mean, I think the most likely outcome for the Worldcon next year is not that it doesn't happen physically.

522
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,480
It's that most of its foreign visitors are effectively disenfranchised,

523
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,800
along with a lot of the older and sicker members of the Worldcon community, which is quite a lot of people.

524
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:33,100
And Worldcon has a tendency to be the convention for a bunch of people in the northeastern United States anyway.

525
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:42,440
And having the business meeting only open to those people would be a major problem that I think they need to address.

526
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,280
Is that fair?

527
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,620
That's not too ranty.

528
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,300
Was that ranty?

529
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,020
That was quite ranty.

530
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,180
That ranty, and it is completely fair.

531
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:56,600
It's not going to land well with Worcestersh fandom who regard any attempt to change or modernise anything as if you are literally the devil.

532
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,840
The comments on the File 770 article declaring this are proof of that.

533
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,940
I think, in general, if the WUSFUS Constitution doesn't allow for this sort of thing, it needs changing.

534
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,740
And if the WUSFUS Constitution cannot be changed, or if the WUSFUS Business Meeting cannot be held virtually,

535
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,260
we need to have a serious think about whether that means those two things are fit for purpose.

536
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,640
Because I would argue it means they are not, and we need to seriously rethink them.

537
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:31,200
The fact that World Cons were held completely successfully up until 1980 without any formal constitution rather makes me think we don't need it.

538
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,740
But perhaps we do, and perhaps it's very important.

539
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,160
But in that case, we need to fix the problems with it.

540
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:48,760
I think any political system that responds to a crisis that requires immediate and well thought through, but nevertheless speedy action,

541
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:55,780
with a decision to delay absolutely everything for a year, is demonstrating that it's not fit for purpose.

542
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:01,680
You know, it's demonstrating that it does not work at the thing it's supposed to do.

543
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,960
Unless the thing it's supposed to do is retard change.

544
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:14,960
And obviously there are people in the WUSFUS fandom for whom retarding change is a feature, not a bug.

545
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,140
And I don't know, I feel like there's something every episode that causes me to go,

546
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,180
Angie, call yourself science fiction fans.

547
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,680
Though they might say, but that's why we want to be careful of change.

548
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,800
Because, you know, we've read those books and it never comes out well.

549
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,560
Our email address is octothorpecast at gmail.com.

550
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,360
And we will read it, we promise.

551
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,220
I know our history is not good on this, but we will.

552
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:49,520
Thank you everyone for listening to the eighth episode of the Octothorpe podcast,

553
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,900
which will come out on the 24th of June 2020.

554
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,920
And it's goodbye from me.

555
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,580
And it's goodbye from me.

556
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,080
And it's goodbye from me.

557
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,800
Yay!

558
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,760
Podcast.

559
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,600
Have a fantastic weekend, Liz.

560
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,560
Started strong, but almost immediately devolved into passive-aggressive.

561
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,220
It's the title of your podcast.

562
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:13,260
Yes, I'm not sure that was one of our more coherent podcasts.

563
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:19,280
The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin MacLeod at incompetech.com.

00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,720
Where are you putting these?

566
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,060
At the bottom.

567
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,700
Oh, I see.

568
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,940
Who'd have been sending those nice letters of comment and they think we've been ignoring

569
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,180
them?

570
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,340
Is this like for weeks and weeks and weeks?

571
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,420
No.

572
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,820
I think Andrew January knows we're not ignoring him.

573
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,440
But we do apparently have one from Mark Olsen.

574
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,860
Two from Mark Olsen.

575
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,160
Oh my God.

576
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,000
Oops.

577
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,540
I am John.

578
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,840
I am bad at emails.

579
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,220
Hi, Liz.

580
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,380
We're also, hello, we're also bad at Twitter.

581
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,160
Oh, I like the letter from Hulk.

582
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,300
It's very nice, isn't it?

583
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,120
It is.

584
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,460
Now I can't hear you at all.

585
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:11,680
Maybe this can be, oh no, maybe this can be an all letter of comment episode.

586
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,860
I was actually thinking that because I don't think we've got a lot of, I don't know if we've

587
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,540
got a lot of topics.

588
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:22,680
I've got the big business meeting, but like, I don't want to go on about that too much because

589
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,440
it's a bit niche.

590
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,180
And also at some point, like, just complaining about things gets wearing because that's what

591
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,100
ATP does.

592
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,840
What, my favourite podcast in the whole world?

593
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,120
I, yeah, and I respect that.

594
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,040
I was very confused.

595
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,960
So I'm like, ATP, do you mean adenosine triphosphate?

596
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,160
Probably not.

597
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,460
All tomorrow's parties?

598
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,740
No, also not.

599
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,040
That podcast that you and Alison like, all right, fine.

600
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,360
Or the, um, or the, like, tennis pro circuit.

601
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,820
The problem with ATP is that because, the thing that typifies the problem with ATP is because

602
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,120
they complain all the time, it means that when they're complaining about things that actually

603
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,540
need people to pay attention, people ignore them because it's just ATP complaining again.

604
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,380
And the thing that makes this the most obvious is when they were complaining about the MacBook

605
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,720
Pro keyboards, no one paid attention.

606
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,780
And then as soon as other people started complaining about the MacBook Pro keyboards, everyone was

607
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,000
like, oh, this is a real problem.

608
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,140
And the point where you complain so often that the things you complain about become non-remarkable

609
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,340
is the point at which you complain too much.

610
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:29,280
Like, if you're just relentlessly negative about everything, it removes any value to your

611
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,780
criticism.

612
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,760
So I get a little bit frustrated.

613
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,180
Relentlessly negative about everything.

614
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,820
There's this week's title.

615
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,880
So what are our topics for today then, John?

616
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,020
We're going to look at letters of comment, Alison.

617
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,540
I've put them in the show notes.

618
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,480
And there are thousands of them.

619
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,980
There are four.

620
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,440
So we can start with a big old apology.

621
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,460
Yes.

622
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,720
Plus the new one from Claire.

623
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,520
And I think we owe a debt of thanks to Claire because if it had not been for her mentioning

624
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,380
that we weren't getting our emails, we would not have known we were not getting our emails.

625
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,660
We would have believed we were podcasting into a void.

626
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:05,460
Yes.

627
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,340
Also, Mark sent us an email about, John, just copy and paste them and we'll sort the line

628
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,200
spacing out later.

629
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,600
Because I can see you're doing it.

630
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,260
Yeah.

631
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,800
And also, the vegetables are great.

632
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,640
I do not know what that is, but I am curious.

633
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,840
Well, you haven't watched Octonauts, have you?

634
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,700
No.

635
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,700
You have not watched Octonauts.

636
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,460
Is this the Welsh show that Farah likes?

637
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,320
Possibly.

638
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,200
I'm not sure it is Welsh, but you can get it in Welsh, which is so delightful.

639
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,420
Apparently, there's some transcripts.

640
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:40,200
We have the other thing in our Gmail thing is a pile of things from otter.ai saying,

641
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,600
we've transcribed your podcast.

642
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,820
Would you like to go and look at it?

643
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,540
So at some point we will do that.

644
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:51,820
Are you going anywhere nice this weekend, Liz?

645
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:58,800
Yes, I'm just going to go and sit in a house with a pool and I am taking my inflatable pool

646
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,000
hammock, my inflatable pool drinks holder and my waterproof Kindle cover.

647
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,220
And that's my weekend.

648
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,260
So you're basically having a long weekend in a large bath.

649
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,320
Yeah, pretty much.

650
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,880
It does sound nice, though.

651
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:18,180
I feel like a holiday, a relaxing holiday somewhere warm would quite suit me about now.

652
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:23,840
I think crucially, I haven't left Bangkok at this point for six months, which is probably

653
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,680
the longest.

654
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,040
Oh, no, that's not true.

655
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,940
I haven't left Bangkok for three months and I've spent most of that time kind of in my own

656
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,140
neighborhood with only occasional visits to any other bit of the city.

657
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,720
I am feeling quite cooped up, as I assume most of you are.

658
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,000
So it feels like now is a good time to take the chance to go somewhere a whole three hours

659
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,520
away because I don't know how long we will all have that chance to do that.

660
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,520
So we've got to the point where having a weekend away seems like the most enormous luxury.

661
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,260
Yeah.

662
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,700
So we're all very, we're all very envious of you.

663
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:03,540
I guess the question is, does our podcast feeling a lot like a conversation that we've had in

664
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,800
the bar put off people who have not already had a conversation in a bar with us in the past?

665
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,660
Write to octothorpecast at gmail.com.

666
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,580
We promise we'll read it this time.

667
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,160
That actually feels like the title of this episode.

668
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,700
We'll promise we really will read it this time.

669
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:24,960
So Marianne tells me that title of your sex tape comes directly from Brooklyn Nine-Nine and

670
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,400
had no antecedents before that.

671
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,280
And I was quite fascinated by that.

672
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:35,020
that it comes more from that's what she said.

673
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,260
And then of course, for people who are 10 years older than me, people 10 years older than me used to say,

674
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,580
as the actress said to the bishop.

675
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,260
Yeah.

676
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,560
Which is exactly the same thing as title of your sex tape.

677
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,000
I think it is the same.

678
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,060
It is the same linguistic construction.

679
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,660
I'm not sure that's apropos of anything.

680
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,860
But apparently it's Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

681
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:05,740
Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a fine, fine show, which has the problem that all shows about the police have.

682
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,120
Of being a show about the police now.

683
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,580
Yeah.

684
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:15,360
Well, all television shows about the police have a structural problem with them.

685
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:24,500
And Brooklyn Nine-Nine is not an exception, which is that they almost invariably show either the police in general

686
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:33,420
or the particular policeman who is the focus of the show as being a very upstanding member of society

687
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:41,180
who does no or does very little wrong in kind of peccadillo ways rather than, oh, the Sweeney, I suppose.

688
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:48,740
Well, I mean, I think we have maybe, this is not entirely on the subject of our podcast,

689
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,020
but there's been quite a lot of interesting writing about this,

690
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:56,460
of how like most police things are procedurals and kind of to do a procedural kind of requires that

691
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,040
the police end up being sort of the protagonist.

692
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,100
And, you know, you can wrap it up neatly because they catch the bad guys.

693
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:09,640
But then you get things like the shield where the policeman is definitely not one of the good guys.

694
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,580
Or you get something like the wire where the police are, you know, sometimes good and sometimes bad,

695
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:21,860
but, you know, presented as this force which has all these different effects and ramifications on a neighbourhood.

696
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,840
And I think there's some more examples.

697
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:31,440
I am now going to pitch my lockdown show, which is a wuss-fuss procedural drama.

698
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,140
Thereby bringing us back on topic.
