1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,160
I mean, I think Liz gets hangry before I have to be at the cricket, so we're good.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,660
Probably not, because it's 3pm.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,020
Oh no!

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,280
She's already eaten.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,720
I will just get angry, if that helps.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:21,280
Well, I'm glad I'd started recording before you said that, Liz.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:42,720
Hello everyone, and welcome to the very 140th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,240
fiction and science fiction fandom, which is wending its merry way to you on the 31st

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,280
of July 2025.

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,620
I'm Jon Coxon.

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm Alison Scott.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,300
And I'm Liz Batty.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,480
We have not got many letters of comment.

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,360
Lots of people said Tammy was great.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,100
It's because Tammy talked a lot of sense, and it is also the summer of fun.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,760
Summer of fun!

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,780
Tommy Ferguson was one of the people, there were many people who said Tammy were great, I'm

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,120
not going to list them all, but Tommy says that Tammy was very entertaining and knowledgeable,

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,720
like our good selves.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,360
and says he has a real blind spot on the WUSFUS and the business meeting.

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,900
To him it is interminably tedious and not his thing.

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,160
But he's glad that we talk about, he says he's glad that people he's met or know of and trust

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,460
are taking that stuff seriously so he doesn't have to.

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,740
So yes, that is a service we aim to provide, so I'm glad it works out.

25
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,620
If you find the business meeting dull and tedious, well, we've got a great episode for you.

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,520
Summer of fun!

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,920
Sorry, Alison is eating an enormous croissant.

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,140
Yeah, she is.

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,220
It looks good.

30
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,040
It does look good.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,940
It's got almonds on.

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,540
This will shock the listener.

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,980
Almond shocked her teen.

34
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,000
It's very good.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He also says,

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,100
The discussion of the retro Hugos and new Hugo categories piqued his interest.

37
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,680
What's the point?

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,180
Is the point to get works more visible to people by them, or is it to reward the creators for

39
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,840
excellent work?

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,020
And I think that's an interesting one, right?

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,340
Like, is the idea to raise awareness of these things to voters?

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,400
Is the idea to make more money for the creators?

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,920
Is the idea to reward the creator?

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,020
I think they're all interlinked.

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,700
But it's an interesting thing to think about, I think.

46
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,420
Certainly, one of the things with the Clark Award is that you know that whichever book wins

47
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,420
the Clark Award will see a bump in sales because it will suddenly get a lot more oxygen.

48
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,460
And that's not, like, a consideration on which one we picked, but, like, it was something

49
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,820
we were aware would happen, if that makes sense.

50
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,640
But it wasn't the point.

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,340
Any thoughts on that, peeps?

52
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,400
I mean, maybe we'll get more into that as we go through business meeting stuff.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,160
We will.

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,820
We will indeed.

55
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,400
Foreshadowing.

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,700
I will hold my opinions.

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,580
I do have a thought on that, which is that as a fan creator, the notion that you might make

58
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,240
more money from winning an award is irrelevant.

59
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,540
But the fact that you get a lot more exposure and also that sense that people like what you

60
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,420
do and approve of it, that's there.

61
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,580
Yes, I can confirm that we have not made more money since winning an award.

62
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,200
But we get more downloads.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,380
Kind of.

64
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,060
Probably at least two people.

65
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,420
Yeah, that's good.

66
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,640
If you're only listening because we won an award, write it.

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,600
Oh, God.

68
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,780
Okay.

69
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,640
But send them just to Alison because she needs her ego, boo.

70
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,420
We had a comment from Costanza on Facebook.

71
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,200
Costanza says they agree that it would be great if continental Europe could run a Worldcon

72
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,560
every five years to complement the UK or Irish ones.

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,060
But they don't see the institutional knowledge to make that happen.

74
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,580
But like looking at this, as she says, looking at the staff lists for Dublin 2019 and Glasgow

75
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,800
2024, the committee positions for non-English speakers is basically one each for those two

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,700
conventions.

77
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,520
David Bamford wrote in on Blue Sky with something related, which was, with the potential best

78
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,020
translated work, Hugo, give impetus to other countries to want to run a Worldcon because

79
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,020
at present it feels like very much USA and Canada or Ireland and Scandinavian countries and

80
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,720
basically no one else.

81
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,380
So I've got like a few things here.

82
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,100
Firstly, I don't think a Scandinavian country has ever run a Worldcon because Finland isn't

83
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,700
Scandinavian.

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,280
So I don't think Scandinavia is in the mix and Finland's only run one.

85
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,080
So I think let's let's occlude that for now.

86
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
David misses out the UK, which is very funny because he worked on a UK Worldcon.

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
But the UK is also running Worldcon.

88
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,680
It's not just Ireland, Scandinavia, USA and Canada.

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,120
But we talked last time about how the UK and Ireland seem to be comfortable at the moment

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,860
with one each every five years.

91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,760
But the thing is, if you look at the places that we might expect a Worldcon to come from

92
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,200
based on previous years, those places are Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.

93
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,700
Germany, I don't think, is in danger of running a Worldcon anytime soon.

94
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,460
I think it would be great if they did, to be clear, but I haven't heard any rumblings.

95
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,960
The Netherlands Worldcon, like there are there have been rumblings, but those rumblings seem

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,060
to be quieting down.

97
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,520
So I'm not sure whether there will be a Netherlands bid this decade or not, but I rather suspect

98
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,160
there might not be.

99
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,720
And then Poland is thinking about a bid.

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,040
Finland is conspicuous by not thinking about a bid and seem to be very happy not doing it

101
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,240
again.

102
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,440
And so, yes, I think that is a good question is like, where would we get continental European

103
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,180
bids from?

104
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,240
And I think something we're going to touch on later this episode and maybe discuss in

105
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,420
more detail in a future episode is that US fan run cons seem to be dying.

106
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,520
And so continental Europe is we are going to need to develop that if Worldcon is going to

107
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,780
survive, because I don't think we can rely on the US to run the majority anymore.

108
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,840
So, yes, that is a consideration that is interesting to think about.

109
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,300
Yeah, it's interesting how Finland ran what I felt was a great Worldcon, but a lot of the

110
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,600
people who ran it seem happy to have run a Finnish Worldcon and are not kind of thinking,

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,340
oh, what will we do in five years time, 10 years time?

112
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,980
Whereas I think there's a bit more crossover between Dublin and London and Glasgow and future

113
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,160
Dublin and whatever future next UK Worldcon there is.

114
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,540
And I say that in like the feeling that there's going to be another UK Worldcon at some point,

115
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,180
whereas for Finland, I don't think there's a prospect of that.

116
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,300
So it's interesting how those ones seem to kind of build and build people up.

117
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,280
And you can see people who came in at 2014 then being like division heads and chairs and things

118
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,160
in later conventions.

119
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,200
Johnny Badley said, apropos of fan awards, why do we not say Hugo award winning podcast on all

120
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,100
of our social media?

121
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,840
I mean, it's possible because we set the social media up before we won a Hugo and we have not

122
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,680
bothered to change it.

123
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,140
Do we not say that?

124
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,900
Wait a sec.

125
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,260
I thought I changed our blue sky bio.

126
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,080
Yeah, I did.

127
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,760
I think I changed our blue sky bio the morning after the Hugo ceremony at Glasgow.

128
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,800
I think I view Facebook as Alison's domain.

129
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,560
Dirty secret listeners, Alison is the one that uses Facebook.

130
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,480
I just use Facebook once every two weeks to post the thing.

131
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,300
Not much.

132
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,760
You use Facebook way more than once a fortnight, Alison.

133
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,540
I do.

134
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,240
Hang on.

135
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,820
I am just going to amend our about info in Facebook in real time.

136
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,840
Actually, I won't do it now.

137
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,980
I'll do it while you guys are getting into the weeds on the Whistler's Constitution.

138
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,160
Listeners, I will bet all of you a shiny penny that Alison will forget.

139
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,160
So when you listen to this, have a look to see if she's forgotten.

140
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,460
And if she has, you owe me a penny.

141
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,320
John, you realise you have to leave that sentence out when you send it to Alison to listen.

142
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,900
Otherwise, she's going to do it on Wednesday or something and ruin all the shiny pennies.

143
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:49,520
Look, Liz, I cannot confirm or deny that I am using advanced psychological techniques to get things changed on Facebook.

144
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,280
We had a couple of Facebook comments from people about Hinkley.

145
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:01,300
Farrah Mendelsohn points out that Hinkley is one of the places that was probably an inspiration for Diana Wynne-Jones' novel Deep Secret,

146
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,340
which is set at a science fiction convention and is very funny.

147
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,440
So thank you very much, Farrah.

148
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,680
And Ali Baker-Brooks write in saying Hinkley Island would be a four-hour journey involving three trains, a bus and a walk for me.

149
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,160
And that's fair.

150
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,880
But also raises a point we didn't raise last time, which is Ali would be concerned about food options outside of the hotel, given how remote it is.

151
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,540
So if you were going to do a convention at the Hinkley Island, I think it could work and I think it could be a good idea.

152
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:36,780
But you'd have to make really sure that the hotel was going to make food that everyone could eat because you can't just nip out to the metropolitan hub that is Hinkley to get better options.

153
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:45,280
So last time, and I admit this was a very long time ago, there were two Indian restaurants, one of which was not bad, within walking distance of the Hinkley Island Hotel.

154
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,220
And that was it.

155
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,020
Yeah.

156
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,320
I've got a friend who can't eat garlic and Indian food.

157
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,700
Great for most dietary restrictions, but not that one.

158
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,360
I mean, I guess it could be like, do you remember the Plot de Con you ran at the civil service college?

159
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,680
It's not called the civil service college.

160
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
We just got...

161
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,120
Yep.

162
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,080
It's gone now.

163
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,420
It's all been turned into a...

164
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,440
It's a luxury weddings venue and a load of housing, I believe now.

165
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,880
We got a pizza delivered, I'm pretty sure.

166
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:22,380
So if you had a venue that were kind of, like, we will happily look the other way if a bunch of delivery stuff turns up, that's not always a surefire option, but it does give you a bit more flexibility.

167
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,340
If your venue's relaxed about it, which they are not all.

168
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,960
Yes.

169
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,660
But if you said, look, you are in the middle of fucking nowhere, off a motorway service station junction.

170
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,200
Can we get some pizzas delivered?

171
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,300
Depends to what extent they're willing to do that.

172
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,760
Can people order in food?

173
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,160
I don't think we should go back to Hinkley Island if we can avoid it, though.

174
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,880
I have never had a problem with getting delivery to a hotel.

175
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,520
This might be a...

176
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,620
Generational issue.

177
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, I'm going to say I'm wondering whether...

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Is that, like, is that something that was more true in previous years?

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,160
Because delivery...

180
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,320
I mean, delivery has exploded.

181
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,020
There's just so many ways you can get things delivered now and there didn't used to be.

182
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,100
So I wonder whether that has shifted as Deliveroo has risen.

183
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,020
Other delivery mechanisms for food are available.

184
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,080
Just Eat Plus.

185
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,780
$5.99 for 90 days.

186
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,040
I think it's also a case of the finances, though.

187
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,300
Like, if we have deals with hotels that rely on us selling a certain amount of food and beverage that we normally make anyway,

188
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,380
that then over that we end up with people getting pizzas, then...

189
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,240
Alison is looking furious at me but can't respond because she's eating croissant.

190
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,860
I'm still eating almond croissant, which is quite good in terms of the reducing interruptions thing.

191
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:49,260
You do not need to worry at the moment about the F&B spend because Easter cons...

192
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,320
You know, it's not unknown for them to hit their F&B target on Friday.

193
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,040
Yeah, we eat and drink far more in the hotel.

194
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,860
Open brackets, particularly drink.

195
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,060
And I'm deliberately not closing the brackets here because, you know,

196
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,860
there's been a whole bit about that in Discord.

197
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,420
Discord?

198
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,260
So we normally hit our target on Friday or Saturday lunchtime

199
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,420
and this is a nice, safe space for convention negotiators at the moment.

200
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,240
I mean, as long as you're aware of what people have previously done.

201
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,460
But the food and drink offering doesn't have to be great for us to hit it

202
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,420
because the people who are happy to eat in the hotel and happy to drink in the hotel

203
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,580
will eat and drink more than the hotel are expecting, even now.

204
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,260
No, and I think, just to go back to Liz's point,

205
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,160
unless the Hinkley Island has a restaurant that can seat like 800,

206
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,620
that's the other thing, right?

207
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,840
Like, there's going to be some eating outside the hotel

208
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,820
just from a hotel-get-full perspective.

209
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:53,900
Shall we move on from letters of comment

210
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,680
and talk about the Wusfus Business Meeting?

211
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,100
Summer of fun!

212
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,400
Did we all have a fun summer at the Wusfus Business Meeting?

213
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,600
I had fun at the Wusfus Business Meeting.

214
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,120
I got to half of one of the meetings in person.

215
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,060
I mean, I followed on to with a couple of others kind of text-wise.

216
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,760
It turns out that if you hold all of your business meetings, all of them,

217
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,500
on Friday or Saturday evenings in summer,

218
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,300
the chances I'm going to be able to go to them are quite small.

219
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,280
So when I filled in the feedback form,

220
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,860
I was having to try and find a way of saying,

221
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,680
it's also true, I'm digressing slightly here,

222
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,920
that if you hold your business meetings in person at a Worldcon,

223
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,740
I'm not going to be able to get to them because I have other things to do.

224
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,560
So this isn't worse than the Worldcon,

225
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,160
but when I filled in the feedback form,

226
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,680
I was kind of like,

227
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,940
yes, I really, really want to attend the Wusfus Business Meeting and yet.

228
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,620
So just to fill in listeners who were not keeping up with the Wusfus Business Meeting,

229
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,640
there were four virtual business meetings

230
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,700
and they were held on Fridays and Saturdays

231
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,380
or possibly Saturdays and Sundays,

232
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,380
depending on your time zone.

233
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,820
And they were held at 9am Pacific Time,

234
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,120
which is where Seattle is.

235
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,080
And to be honest, I looked at time zones

236
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,280
and where we reasonably want people to be able to attend,

237
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,940
which is, you know, there's people across all the US time zones,

238
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,260
across multiple European ones and some other ones.

239
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,820
And basically, I think this time might be the best time you can pick

240
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,920
because it is at least when people are awake.

241
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,880
And it's basically pretty good until you get kind of east of about the Middle East.

242
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,620
And then it's really early if you're in Australia and New Zealand.

243
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,660
But if you're going to say, OK, there's a chunk of time zones

244
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,640
where we think fewer people are even members who might want to attend,

245
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,160
then they probably excluded the ones that have the fewest people.

246
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,300
Yeah, there's no...

247
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,780
I don't think there's a way of being more enfranchising with a live meeting.

248
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,820
One of the reasons I suggested an asynchronous meeting

249
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,360
in my part of the relevant committee

250
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:58,080
is that I think live meeting is always going to disenfranchise people who can't attend

251
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,040
because they can't make that time.

252
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,160
And the only way to get away from that

253
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,860
is if people can make the decisions at different points in the day,

254
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,640
which is impossible with a system like this one.

255
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,680
But I think Seattle did as well as they could

256
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,300
while sticking with a synchronous meeting.

257
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,300
And I don't think there was any way they could have done differently this year.

258
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
So one of the things it clashed with had been in my diary for over a year.

259
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,900
So it would be quite good if they could...

260
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,240
if future WorldComp's could get these dates out even earlier.

261
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,740
Yeah, but a thing that's been in your diary for a year,

262
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,940
that implies to me that that is something which is so important to you

263
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,120
that you would not skip it

264
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,160
even if the WorldComp business meeting dates had gone in there first.

265
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,900
Yeah, what was it, Alice?

266
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,340
What was the thing that had been in your diary for over a year?

267
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,080
The cricket.

268
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,280
Yeah, so you would have gone to the cricket

269
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,540
because they weren't going to move the cricket for the business meeting

270
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,220
even if you'd written to the ECB.

271
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,180
No, but I might not have gone to that game.

272
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,500
I would probably...

273
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,120
If I'd known that the business meeting was going to be there,

274
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,920
which I could have done,

275
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
not all cricket tickets come out a year in advance.

276
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,940
It was only because of an international.

277
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,720
And I think I might choose the business meeting

278
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,520
over any particular cricket match.

279
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,940
Yes, fair enough, fair enough.

280
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,960
I just say, I think we reach out that there were issues with the timings

281
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,020
because basically you're always going to have...

282
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,860
If you have it on a weekend,

283
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,280
which is what you kind of have to do

284
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,840
in order to have people who can attend across time zones,

285
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,420
then you're also going to run into the problem of

286
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,940
you're going to clash with the Sabbath in some places.

287
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,320
And also, I do believe they moved at least one agenda item

288
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,680
because the person who wanted to speak about it

289
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,700
couldn't make it on that meeting.

290
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,060
So if you've got a bit of flexibility like that, it helps.

291
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,120
And I guess having some on Friday and some on Saturday

292
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,160
helps a bit with that.

293
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,700
But it was an experiment.

294
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,780
How do we think the experiment went?

295
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,560
Well.

296
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,840
Very well.

297
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,000
I genuinely do.

298
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,060
I think it went really well.

299
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,860
Oh, I thought you were saying well,

300
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,560
and then you were going to finish with the whole sentence.

301
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,940
But you know, you're just saying it went well.

302
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,160
It was a whole sentence.

303
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,080
It was just a very short one.

304
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,500
No, yeah, I thought it went really well.

305
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,380
I think it is...

306
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,720
And actually, I'm going to say something controversial,

307
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,980
which is if you're going to have it be a meeting,

308
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,800
Robert's rules in a virtual space, they work fine.

309
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,900
I'm not sure we need a big evaluation of the process.

310
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,440
Like, it's still a bit annoying.

311
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,720
It's all right.

312
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,020
Lumi seemed to work quite well.

313
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,040
I thought, you know, there were some minor technical issues

314
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,760
with the Zoom, but nothing that isn't, you know,

315
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,520
nothing more than other webinars I've been on for work

316
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,200
or for fandom.

317
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,600
And it meant that you could sort of...

318
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,600
There was a transcript you could follow along with as it was going,

319
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,240
which was lovely.

320
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,220
So that, like, if you, you know, had domed out for a bit or whatever,

321
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,880
you could go back and work out what had happened.

322
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,480
If you needed the loo and you were wearing Bluetooth headphones,

323
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,740
you could just keep listening to the discussions in the loo.

324
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,620
You know, lots of benefits.

325
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,880
I didn't have to miss any WorldCom program to go.

326
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,700
I mean, that's a big one, isn't it?

327
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,560
Yeah, it's quite good.

328
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,040
And yeah, I got to three of the four meetings.

329
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,180
The fourth one, I had a prior engagement.

330
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,900
But also the fourth one was probably the one I didn't have as much

331
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,500
I wanted to see.

332
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,960
Although I will say a couple of things went the wrong way.

333
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,460
And I do, in hindsight, I'm like, oh, maybe I should have gone.

334
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,000
But certainly I got to way more of it than I would have done

335
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,640
had it been held in Seattle, which is zero because I'm not going to Seattle.

336
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,120
But even if I had been into Seattle,

337
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,440
I would not have got 75% of the business meeting.

338
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,260
Yeah, I went to roughly 50% of the business meeting.

339
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,100
And by that, I mean, I went to about the first hour and a half

340
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,740
of two hours of all of them.

341
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,940
And then I fell asleep.

342
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,300
So there were certain time zone issues for me.

343
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,220
But that's, yeah, again, that's still more than I would have got to

344
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,240
in Seattle in person.

345
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,800
And since I'm not going to Seattle and I'm a virtual member,

346
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,360
I would have got to see zero of it.

347
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,740
So yeah, that worked for me.

348
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,720
There were consistently, I think, somewhere between about 140 and 160 people

349
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,180
whenever I checked the numbers.

350
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,700
So that seems to be like the number we can get.

351
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,560
And it did seem to be pretty consistent.

352
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,740
And I saw a lot of the same people each time.

353
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,660
So I think that is like the business meeting constituency

354
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,280
who are prepared to do it virtually.

355
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,640
seems like a good number.

356
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,640
It seemed to me that most of the people who I think of as business meeting regulars

357
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,560
were in the mix there.

358
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,640
I don't know.

359
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,020
There probably are people out there who hate the idea of online meetings

360
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,860
and hate the idea of things online, but go to the business meeting in person.

361
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,980
And I may just not know those people very well.

362
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, in which case, they're probably not on the Discord to complain about it

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,680
not being in person because they're also probably not big Discord people.

364
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,140
And we should say there was an official business meeting Discord,

365
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,780
as well as there still being the unofficial business meeting Discord,

366
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,600
which, yeah, maybe we'll talk about a bit more, was quite interesting.

367
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,880
I think it's going to be interesting because I think if this business meeting

368
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,320
managed to get like a thousand people, everyone would be like,

369
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,720
yes, this shows a resounding success of virtual over live.

370
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,320
If there'd only been 20 people, that would show that maybe there is not an appetite

371
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,040
for doing it virtually.

372
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,960
But what we actually got is a number of people,

373
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,380
which is more than you normally get at business meetings I've been to,

374
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,500
but probably a little bit less than absolute peak attendance at any live business meeting.

375
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,640
So I think that's enough to say it's a success,

376
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,900
but not enough to say it's so successful that we should immediately adopt this for everything

377
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,720
and never do anything else.

378
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,240
Oh, I think we should immediately adopt it for everything.

379
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,940
I was really impressed with it.

380
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,160
I love the fact that the business has been done without it

381
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,280
disrupting everyone's world cons.

382
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,420
I hope that we've got some kind of decompression chamber for business meeting junkies

383
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,740
who don't know what to do at a world con these days.

384
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,700
You get that conclave LARP in.

385
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,080
There's ways we can do things for those people.

386
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,500
I think that's fine, but I think that is a more of a,

387
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,320
Alison thinks this is great than a,

388
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,300
we can look at the numbers and say this was a resounding, overwhelming success.

389
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,060
I think we can just say it was a success.

390
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,640
Oh, okay.

391
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,700
So you're saying that vibes are less important than statistics.

392
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
In some issues.

393
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,180
I'm just saying it's interesting, right?

394
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,400
Which is out of step with some scientists,

395
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,560
but me and Liz are both pro stats, anti vibes.

396
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,720
Hmm.

397
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,020
But I think before the meeting, there was a bit of discussion,

398
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,800
like, is there this big untapped set of people

399
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,460
who would want to go to business meetings if they're held virtually,

400
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,300
who don't go to see them live?

401
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,540
And I think what this demonstrates is that this year,

402
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,900
there were those people, but maybe not hundreds and hundreds of them.

403
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,020
So I don't know.

404
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,460
So, okay.

405
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,460
So I think there's a problem here, which is that we don't have the stats.

406
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,880
I don't know what the attendance for the in-person business meeting usually is.

407
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,020
And I would be curious to know.

408
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,540
I think, I think you're right that it's not like we got a thousand people joined the online business

409
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,920
meeting.

410
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,680
We got a reasonable number.

411
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,420
And I think there is a, probably an inherent cap on how many people want to attend a business

412
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,940
meeting, even if it's online.

413
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,400
I will say though, I think there's a couple of other things,

414
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,020
which is you look at the numbers for the Glasgow consultative votes versus the numbers for the

415
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,360
Seattle consultative votes.

416
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,380
And you can see that members are generally less engaged with the mechanics of things at

417
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,500
Seattle than they were at Glasgow.

418
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,220
And last episode and the episode before, we talked about how we think that's probably at

419
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:03,540
least partly due to Seattle's communication strategy or to be provocative, lack thereof.

420
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,460
And I think it's difficult because what I don't know is if you do this for five years and

421
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,300
get people used to the idea and get people like talking about how this is it, how it works,

422
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,660
does that number go up?

423
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:22,320
Because the in-person business meeting has had, what, 40 years and has capped at maybe 100

424
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,760
odd.

425
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,280
And the virtual business meeting is starting at 140.

426
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,760
And so in two, three, four years time, does that number stay there or does it rise?

427
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,620
I don't know the answer to that, but I guess that's my, that's my wonder.

428
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:40,840
And I will also say, I don't think it's possible to say, you know, it's such a resounding success

429
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,700
on a numbers basis, but I think philosophically, it so clearly wasn't a failure and it so clearly

430
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,540
does open the franchise to more people that I would want them to move to this going forward

431
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,400
because it's been shown because there was nothing that went wrong and there was a good number

432
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:57,900
of people.

433
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,240
I'm like, I don't see a reason not to continue with this.

434
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,620
And I would want there to be, I think my assumption would be that this should continue to be how

435
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,940
we do it going forward unless there is a good reason that it proves not to work.

436
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,740
I'm assuming, and I don't know, but for listeners, Jesse Lipp, who is the presiding officer of this

437
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,020
year's business meeting, is also the presiding officer at LA.

438
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,180
So I'm assuming Jesse will make similar decisions next year as this year, unless, unless they

439
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,240
think there is something that's changed massively between the two years.

440
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,380
And I will also say that Jesse is putting together a survey to circulate to people who attended

441
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,100
the Seattle business meeting to canvas for opinions and stuff.

442
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,680
So it may also be that kind of, we get some more, I don't know, I assume the results that

443
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,160
won't be public, but presumably that will, that will feed into their decision as to whether

444
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,240
to do similar or different things at LA.com.

445
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,420
So those are my thoughts, I think, on that.

446
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,820
Yeah.

447
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,440
And I do, I do largely agree with you.

448
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,120
I just thought it was interesting to look at the, the numbers having, you know, that been

449
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,920
hotly debated before.

450
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,480
I think the number of people speaking who were European was higher than I would have expected.

451
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,260
And I think that is illustrative.

452
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:14,380
I felt that a number of people who I know in the past have complained that it is extremely

453
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,400
difficult for them to get to Worldcon and expensive.

454
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,860
And therefore they cannot participate in the business meeting as much as they would like,

455
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,040
because they're rarely at Worldcon and where they are, it cannot be their top priority.

456
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,860
We're actually active and engaged with this one.

457
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,000
And I thought that was quite good to see.

458
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,500
Yeah.

459
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,580
So about the people speaking, I think despite there being kind of 140 to 160 people, I felt

460
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,820
like I saw maybe 20 to 30 people who would speak in favour of motions.

461
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,100
Apart from maybe there are, you know, a few people who maybe spoke for on one motion and

462
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,940
then quite a few people who spoke up for quite a few.

463
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:53,160
And I think that sort of replicates a bit the dynamic I see in the live business meetings.

464
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,540
And I wonder if there is a way to encourage more people to speak.

465
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,220
And I'm as good as this is anyone.

466
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:04,260
But that's also because I was usually watching the business meeting in my pyjamas and not inclined

467
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:10,260
to, you know, I do not have the brainpower really to speak coherently and concisely in favour

468
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,100
or against motions at past midnight.

469
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,320
So that's partly my reason not for doing it.

470
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,060
But on the other hand, I'm not sure everyone who speaks at a business meeting is coherent

471
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,560
and concise.

472
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,960
So maybe it wouldn't be worse.

473
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,840
Did you know that you can write down the thing you're planning to say and then say

474
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,020
it from the thing you wrote down before you give your speech?

475
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,920
Because I had my mind.

476
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,980
It never occurred to me to do that until someone was like, I've done this.

477
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,940
And I was like, what?

478
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,840
So yeah, anyway, top tip.

479
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,660
I can't tell if that's...

480
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,480
That sounded more like a burn of Liz than I intended it to.

481
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,540
It was a burn of me.

482
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,020
Yeah, I can't tell if that's really patronising or not, John.

483
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,880
It was intended as a burn against myself.

484
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,800
It was intended as a self-burn, Liz.

485
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,460
You are much more considered to me in general.

486
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,360
I think it works really well if you're maybe the first or the second person to speak for

487
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,060
or against something.

488
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,960
But a lot of time I might have been speaking in reaction to someone else or you need to

489
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,780
change it on the fly because someone's already made your point.

490
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,540
And that is a bit more difficult if you write it down.

491
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,080
But no, you're right.

492
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,900
If you have something you want to say, you can write it down and that probably would improve

493
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,760
a lot of speeches.

494
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,360
Speeches should be reactive, but you often find that they're not.

495
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,920
That people do read out a prepared speech that largely duplicates or contradicts other things

496
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,300
that people have said, even on their side.

497
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:28,280
I feel I benefit quite a lot when reacting to things on the fact that I'm doing it on the

498
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,620
podcast and it gets edited.

499
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:38,740
And so I'm now far less likely to ask questions or intervene or make speeches or any of that stuff

500
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,760
in large group organisations, which may or may not be good.

501
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,320
probably is good.

502
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,480
But yeah, and I think obviously, I think whichever way you do this, there is going to be a core

503
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,720
of people who are more likely to comment because you see that replicated in every community you

504
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,000
make.

505
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,820
Like, it's a big, like, I mean, it's particularly magnified in newspaper comment sections.

506
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:04,820
I think it's like 0.1% of readers comment, like 99% of the comments or something like that.

507
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,340
There's some, I mean, I don't ever quote those numbers readers, listeners.

508
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,480
But like, there's like a big gulf.

509
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,160
And I suspect you see the same thing on Anonymous Claire, where there's some people who post a lot

510
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,500
and there are some people who post very occasionally.

511
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,920
There are some people who have, as far as I can tell, never posted.

512
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:26,220
But like, I don't know how, I don't think that's a unique feature of the business meeting,

513
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,060
I guess is what I'm saying.

514
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,200
Very roundabout way.

515
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,500
Should have written it down before I started.

516
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,480
No, that's interesting because I was, again, there was a kind of professional Slack that

517
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,560
I'm on and someone did basically post some stats, which is saying, you know, about 10% of people

518
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,120
were reading every day and maybe 1% of people post.

519
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,420
That might be good rule of thumb.

520
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,520
I have two more points.

521
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,600
One is that I thought the Lumi platform did work well.

522
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,020
I think one slight issue is that you, it's through Zoom, but the Zoom is in a browser.

523
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,440
And I think a lot of people would love it if you could pop that Zoom out, because then

524
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,020
you could have that on one window and have everything else in the other window.

525
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,520
You would also, I think people are more familiar with how to get like their sound connected to

526
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,560
Zoom that's not in a browser, because you have this thing where you have to get the browser

527
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,420
based permissions, right?

528
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,480
And the Zoom permissions that I think was causing some issues.

529
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,940
So that would be nice.

530
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,300
I think the other thing is that we discovered that the Lumi platform is quite expensive.

531
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,160
So it's going to be, you know, if other future world comms want to do this, they are going

532
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,740
to have to budget for the Lumi platform.

533
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,340
And I think that's because we had two people sitting in on all the meetings who were like opening

534
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,580
polls and stuff for us.

535
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:35,240
So as well as all the volunteer time needed from like the top table people and from like

536
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,900
the people adminning the Discord and so on and helping with tech support, we also had Lumi

537
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,160
time.

538
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,920
So, I mean, I think that is a worthwhile investment, but it is something that comms need to find the

539
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,380
money for.

540
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,020
Whereas I think business meetings themselves are pretty cheap because you're using space that

541
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,740
the con already has.

542
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,660
And I don't think not having an in-person business meeting means you can save $20,000 on your

543
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,340
space requirements because you'll just use it for something else.

544
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:06,140
Not $20,000, but Glasgow certainly had an entire extra negotiation with an entire extra hotel

545
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,200
to use its conference space for Worcestershire.

546
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,060
Oh, that's true.

547
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,300
Yeah.

548
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,080
But they were part of the hotel block.

549
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,780
So it's unclear how, I don't know how that worked.

550
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,460
And no one liked that anyway, because we were in a different place.

551
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,440
I liked it a lot because it was near the pool, but that's not germane.

552
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,000
I think I'm going to say something here, which is, I think Lumi is a really excellent example.

553
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,540
And I'm going to ask Alison what she thinks here.

554
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:38,120
But I think that you could do that meeting without Lumi.

555
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:47,420
I think, yes, what we do is we set Andrew January to designing a Wusfus portal that links things

556
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,720
like in exactly the way that Lumi did.

557
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:57,160
So I think there's two options here, which is I think you could probably run some volunteer

558
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,780
written software that would do this as well, if not better than Lumi, because Lumi was fine,

559
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,800
but it was a little bit clunky.

560
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,980
But I also don't quite understand why you can't do pretty much all of that just within

561
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,140
built Zoom webinar features, because Zoom webinars have the Q&A.

562
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,480
So you can like let people request to speak and tick them off when they've spoken as you

563
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,240
can do all of that functionality straight in Zoom.

564
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,580
Obviously, you couldn't do the presenting of documents, but having a like document channel

565
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,960
on the Discord would have worked for that because the Discord was gated.

566
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,060
So you could have had all of the agenda and stuff like that on the Discord.

567
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:40,060
You could have done voting on the Discord with the inbuilt Discord polls feature, or you could

568
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,840
have written some voting system for that.

569
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,500
I don't know if Zoom supports STV.

570
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,080
Discord doesn't support STV either.

571
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:54,660
But like, and I'm kind of like, is this software worth the money for what it does?

572
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:59,840
And I think the answer might be, if you're a massive corporation or a city council, absolutely.

573
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,400
And if you're fandom, we could actually make it work quite well without spending the money.

574
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,320
But I don't know.

575
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,720
$5,000 a session.

576
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:16,020
And I feel like, yes, I feel like Discord, the good old fashioned Zoom and Discord with lots of

577
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,780
faffing about stuff will get you most of the way.

578
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,340
I mean, I think it will be interesting to talk to the Worcestershire team.

579
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,840
If you were involved in the decision to buy Lumi rather than using a Doom and Discord setup,

580
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,680
please write in.

581
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,320
I mean, I think it was absolutely correct to use Lumi this year because you want minimal

582
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,820
friction.

583
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,920
Oh, yes, I agree.

584
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,400
The part where I think it might be a little tricky on Discord and need some software is that

585
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,040
they had a lot of votes in Lumi and they obviously had it so you could just push a button and

586
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,780
pop the vote up.

587
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,940
So I guess you'd want to basically be able to have pre-written stuff that you just push a

588
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,900
button and it puts up the appropriate poll.

589
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,420
Like if you know you're going to be voting on debate times or whatever and you have a click.

590
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,680
I'm sure there were some polls where there were multiple options, but maybe I'm...

591
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,400
I don't think there were, but I might be wrong.

592
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,500
No, the elections, but the elections weren't being done that way anyway.

593
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,140
Oh, the election system was pretty clunky.

594
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,340
Yeah, I mean, even in Lumi, you were copying and pasting a...

595
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,780
Yeah, some poor person had to write like a Perl script or something to like split on underscores

596
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,000
or whatever.

597
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

598
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,900
I think there's also a consideration here, which is the cost of the Lumi was covered by the

599
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,580
Scalzi Foundation.

600
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,740
And I guess it sort of depends whether or not John's up for just doing that forever

601
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,100
because he is super rich.

602
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,500
But maybe, I don't know.

603
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,740
If they could get this to be a sponsored thing where you're like, if you're an organization

604
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:42,660
and you give us $20,000, the business meeting is sponsored by your organization.

605
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,060
I don't have a massive problem with that.

606
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,280
And that would defray the cost.

607
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,480
And I know sponsorship is a fraught thing, but that is the secret other option, which

608
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,940
is we could get someone else to pay for it.

609
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,360
And maybe that's OK, rather than burning all of our people points.

610
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,420
This is a classic example of an area where you might well be able to get sponsorship and

611
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,640
nobody would be very offended.

612
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,460
I think if you go to a business and say, would you like to sponsor this?

613
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:13,140
What you'll get is basically 150 of the really nerdiest nerds who ever nerded will see the

614
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,400
name of your company four times.

615
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,140
We might not get $20,000.

616
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,860
Depends how engaged the people attending the business meeting are.

617
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,380
And I would argue quite.

618
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,260
We should be very engaged in Robert's Rules of Order.

619
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,860
So we have to get sponsored by whoever publishes Robert's Rules of Order because we must be selling

620
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,560
a lot of copies.

621
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,500
Now you're thinking with portals.

622
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,180
No, because this is how the people who make Robert's Rules of Order make their money,

623
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,500
right?

624
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,980
Oh, let's see if we can get sponsored by rival Rules of Order.

625
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,880
Ha ha!

626
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,660
Oh, that'd be hilarious!

627
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,240
Amazing.

628
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,720
OK.

629
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,540
This is a conversation we could defer.

630
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:53,680
However, also, I mean, I probably wasn't paying attention, but when you mentioned it there,

631
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,720
that was the first I'd heard that the Scalzi Foundation had sponsored this.

632
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,040
So it's possible that we didn't quite get the word out about making clear that that was

633
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,900
a major sponsorship.

634
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,660
And thank you.

635
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:10,800
The fact that you went to half of a business meeting and attended it the latter half.

636
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah, it was mentioned at the start of the meeting.

637
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,160
I think everyone who was there for the start of any of the sessions had heard that.

638
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,600
I don't know how many people did sort of only attend one and only attend from the middle.

639
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,300
But I wonder whether you're quite a long way towards the edges of that bell curve.

640
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,540
Yes. So I was transcript only.

641
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,900
One of the things about the transcript is that we had live transcripts that were, in general,

642
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,020
pretty good, but they clearly hadn't been fed a list of terms that we were likely to use.

643
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,580
So they struggled with some of our words.

644
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,020
And I suspect one of those words was Scalzi Foundation.

645
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:49,640
Oh, I have a further thought on the Lumi Discord thing, actually, which is that if all the polls

646
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,420
and stuff ran through Discord and people were just on Zoom, then you could easily vote in

647
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,720
all the polls without actually being at the Zoom. And I don't know if that's a desirable thing or not.

648
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,020
You could do that anyway.

649
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,620
But you'd have to be logged into the Lumi, right?

650
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,580
You have to be logged into the Lumi, but I don't think you have to click join audio or join meeting

651
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,520
on the embedded Zoom.

652
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,440
Oh, yeah. I suppose you could just be in the Lumi and voting and not listening to the audio or video.

653
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,840
Yeah, that would work.

654
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,500
I think that is a risk with using anything that isn't in the Zoom meeting directly.

655
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,460
I think. I might be wrong.

656
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,640
And it's certainly true that there are people who could log into Lumi who would not want to use Discord.

657
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,300
And, like, I'm not saying it's perfect, but it comes down to that question of,

658
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,040
is it saves you $20,000 and a lot of volunteer effort perfect?

659
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,820
And the answer to that might be different.

660
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,040
But, like, I agree with the point you made a while back,

661
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,560
that I think using Lumi for this in the first instance was very wise.

662
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,820
Buying in the solution for the first time you're doing it, I think, is the right call.

663
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,760
Do we want to say anything else about Lumi and the business meeting platform?

664
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,580
I think we're good. I will just make...

665
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,500
I have comments about, like, the Discordiness,

666
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,340
but I think they will come up as we go through items on the agenda.

667
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,780
no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no- about Liz.

668
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,880
As if it hasn't already been about Liz.

669
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,560
This was Liz Batty, now it's about Liz.

670
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,540
So we did some business.

671
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,340
I don't think we're going to go through all of the motions.

672
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,800
We are not.

673
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,560
Unless this is going to be like the six-hour business being special.

674
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,700
Listeners, if we opened a Patreon, would you?

675
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,020
What do we want to pull out?

676
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,600
All right, let me go through in order.

677
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,380
The first meeting didn't do anything particularly interesting or daft,

678
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,420
so I vote that we don't talk about that in detail,

679
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,180
but we've put a link in the show notes listeners.

680
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,060
And the second meeting was entirely an executive session,

681
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,240
which means we can't talk about it,

682
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,580
because if you wanted to know what happened, you had to attend.

683
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,040
There was a brief summary made,

684
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,580
and it was posted on the Seattle website itself,

685
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,560
and we've got a link to that in the show notes as well.

686
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,960
So if you would like to go and see what happened, you can.

687
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,260
But basically, you know, we...

688
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,960
Mostly the thing that happened of note there was that a trial committee was formed

689
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,560
to litigate a thing which I can't tell you about,

690
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,020
and we created a committee to look at whether or not we might need some ethics

691
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,820
here and there in WUSFUS.

692
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,920
Yeah, you can see the minutes do say kind of which motions were passed or referred or whatever,

693
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,500
and in the agenda you can see the motions that were passed,

694
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,060
but you won't be able to ever see or watch any of the discussions on those

695
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,240
or the committee report that led to a lot of these motions being proposed,

696
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,780
unless you are a member of the Worldcon.

697
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,840
So we therefore can't tell you any of it.

698
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:47,260
I mean, I think it is okay to say that the trial committee related to actions of the Chengdu Worldcon

699
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,320
and some of its committee members, yeah?

700
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,580
We can say what it says on the website, which is,

701
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,960
the business meeting voted to impanel a trial committee to evaluate the evidence

702
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,060
regarding whether the conduct of certain members of WUSFUS,

703
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,660
as part of the administration of the 2023 Hugo Awards,

704
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,300
tends to bring WUSFUS into disrepute, disrupt its well-being or hamper its work.

705
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,720
And that's on their website, so we can say that.

706
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,920
And I guess we can say who's on the trial committee.

707
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,320
Yeah, we can.

708
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,340
The trial committee will be Dr. Science,

709
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,980
Espana Sheriff, Ian Stockdale, Kat Corbetti and Chris Snyder,

710
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,760
who's also known as Enchanter.

711
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,920
And that was announced at the fourth installment of the business meeting,

712
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,900
which was the third main business meeting.

713
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,020
I know that's confusing listeners, I apologize.

714
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,240
And there's something I want to discuss a little bit here,

715
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,800
which is I, one of the things that was discussed a little bit

716
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,680
at points.

717
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,500
And I think I can say that because it is in the Seattle summary.

718
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,680
There was a discussion about conflict of interest,

719
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,720
and that led to some verbiage on the website,

720
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,120
which says,

721
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,780
acceptances to the trial committee should be accompanied

722
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,460
by a declaration of any existing conflict of interest

723
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,620
or a declaration that none exists.

724
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,220
And I think one of the things I'm hoping that the committee set up

725
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,120
to look at ethics looks at is what,

726
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,940
WUSFUS does not have a definition of a conflict of interest,

727
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,300
and I think it would be useful if we had some guidance as to what means you should consider

728
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,260
yourself conflicted.

729
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,980
But I will note that Chris Snyder, Enchanter,

730
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:17,600
is the partner of the presiding officer of the business meeting at which this committee

731
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,400
was constituted.

732
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,240
And because that is the same presiding officer as 2026,

733
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,540
it is that presiding officer that will preside over the report of the trial committee

734
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,760
and its implementations.

735
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,040
And that was not disclosed in voting,

736
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
and that made me uncomfortable,

737
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,040
because I think that is a conflict of interest.

738
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,200
Other members, I think,

739
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,540
did a better job of disclosing where the conflicts were,

740
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,060
and certainly as an academic,

741
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,520
the mode is very much these days to disclose

742
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,020
and let the editor work out whether or not they think it's a problem

743
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,900
rather than to assume it won't be a problem.

744
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,940
But no, I didn't like that,

745
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,700
and I think we need to do better.

746
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,300
I think it's not clear,

747
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,740
because there are two people named as being the manager for the WUSFUS case

748
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,840
at the trial that the trial committee will be working on,

749
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,340
and so I can't tell kind of how much stuff is delegated entirely to them

750
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,260
versus how much still comes under the auspice of the,

751
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,300
like, presiding chair of the business meeting.

752
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,520
But probably we should have some kind of list of examples of conflict of interest.

753
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,020
But you're right,

754
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,560
normally if I'm doing a conflict of interest form,

755
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,200
it will have like,

756
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,940
okay, do you have any of these specific financial ones

757
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,140
or these specific personal ones

758
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,680
or, you know, these are the ones.

759
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,200
And then at the end,

760
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,440
it says,

761
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,700
please disclose anything else that you think might be relevant.

762
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,660
And I think that probably means you should err on the side of caution

763
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,220
and just disclose everything,

764
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,020
but we don't actually have any sort of examples for this.

765
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,840
And I think I've never seen anyone have to declare conflicts of interest

766
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,820
for anything else in WUSFUS.

767
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,280
I don't think we declare them for things like the Mark Protection Committee

768
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,960
or people who are in proposing motions or whatever.

769
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,300
So it's hard for us to,

770
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,340
it's a thing where we,

771
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,960
I don't think we have any prior art to look at.

772
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,660
Oh, I'm going to go off at a tiny tangent then as my first response here

773
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,280
and say, yeah, but I think we should.

774
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,840
I think if the person proposing,

775
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,820
just to take a random example,

776
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,300
a best audiobook, Hugo,

777
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:08,200
is the president of the US Audiobook Publishers Federation.

778
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,700
I think that is a useful piece of information

779
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,040
which people should know when considering what to do.

780
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,820
And go on, Ethics Committee,

781
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,900
please look at this.

782
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,080
And I think in this case,

783
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,440
I feel like I'm not as convinced as John

784
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,200
that you shouldn't have somebody

785
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,160
who's got a relationship with the presiding officer necessarily.

786
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,580
But I think I probably do agree that

787
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,660
it is something that you'd have expected them to disclose.

788
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,140
And maybe the fact that other people didn't expect them to disclose,

789
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,160
they clearly didn't think it was relevant to disclose.

790
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,420
I think that is where an Ethics Committee could be useful.

791
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,920
I think, yeah, I think that's the thing, right?

792
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,200
I think that I don't know if I think this is a conflict,

793
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,660
but I do think that I'm concerned it wasn't disclosed.

794
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,220
The fact it wasn't disclosed makes me much more suspicious of it

795
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,000
than I would be if it had been,

796
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,520
which is the other thing with disclosing widely

797
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,180
is that you set up a, you know,

798
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,300
I am not hiding anything from you.

799
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,040
Here are all the things you might want to know.

800
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,440
I don't think any of them are a problem,

801
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,660
but you can make your own mind up.

802
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,720
That is how I've been trained to treat disclosures.

803
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,920
We were in some back chat where we were all going,

804
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
who from this back chat ought to be,

805
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,900
ought to put themselves forward for the trial committee?

806
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,980
And we concluded that the answer was Espania.

807
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,680
So thank you very much, Espania.

808
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,280
We appreciate you taking a solid one for the team here.

809
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,860
Yeah.

810
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,780
Is that fair?

811
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,180
Is that a reasonable thing to say?

812
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,380
I have a, I will disclose a conflict of interest.

813
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm married to Espania.

814
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,160
So I also think it's good that she's on the committee

815
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,540
because I think she has good judgment.

816
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,600
Very sensible person who will say what she thinks.

817
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,240
Yeah.

818
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,820
I mean, I know or have worked with most of the trial committee

819
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,300
and I think all the ones that I know or have worked with are very solid

820
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,040
and I'm quite happy to see them on the trial committee.

821
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,160
That works for me.

822
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,100
And also at this point it's 2025

823
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,380
and I am not personally interested in spending like another year

824
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,600
litigating the 2023 Hugos in depth.

825
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,980
So thank you to those people who are still prepared to put that effort in

826
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,940
because I think I've discussed it to death.

827
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,500
Let's get it done.

828
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,200
Wrap it up.

829
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,820
Move on.

830
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,260
I assume you voted for the trial committee to be founded, Liz.

831
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,100
Because there were some people who were like,

832
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,420
this is dragging on too much.

833
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,920
We don't want there to be any more discipline.

834
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,220
Let's just forget it all.

835
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,320
And I am very much of the opinion that I don't want to think about it,

836
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,920
but I think someone should think about it.

837
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,540
I went to bed before we formed the trial committee.

838
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,140
Oh shit, Liz.

839
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,880
Life hack.

840
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,600
Liz formed a trial committee in her sleep.

841
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,060
Well done.

842
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,640
Yeah.

843
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,200
If anyone asks me, how did you vote on that one?

844
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,960
It's like, I'm worth a sleep.

845
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,840
That is an interesting thing in that because all the votes on Lumi,

846
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,100
you just see the totals.

847
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,080
Whereas in the room, you can kind of see who has their hand up and who doesn't.

848
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,020
It does give a level of anonymity to the voting.

849
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,220
John does not know what I voted for and what I voted against,

850
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,220
or even whether I was in the room for the votes unless you're paying a lot of attention,

851
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,080
which is kind of a little bit of a different dynamic to being in the room.

852
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,100
Whereas if I'm sat next to John, he can see whether I've got my hand up and scowl at me

853
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,180
if he agrees with me.

854
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,160
Yeah, I don't know.

855
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,300
I can't work out if that is good, bad or indifferent.

856
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,360
I'm going to say it's bad.

857
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,200
It's a parliamentary system and there's a lot to be, you know, they are normally,

858
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,440
you have voting conducted in public so that people can see which way people voted.

859
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,700
I think if you're going to change that kind of as a,

860
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,320
oh, this is a thing now,

861
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,500
I would have liked to have seen voter lists on both sides for every motion

862
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,720
as an output of those meetings.

863
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,880
I've got a proposal.

864
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,160
Did anyone who had a Wii ever play the Everybody Votes channel?

865
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,100
Endlessly.

866
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,820
Our family did that a lot.

867
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,860
I have little kids.

868
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,120
And you know, the little people with like your me face on that wander about in the votes.

869
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,240
I would like that for the business meeting.

870
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,660
I would like everyone to have a little animated avatar that wanders from one side to the other.

871
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,960
Andrew January, if you're in there, get on this.

872
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,140
I better find a video of that for everyone who is aware of the Everybody Votes thing.

873
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,100
I remember it.

874
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,800
I remember it.

875
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,500
It tells us what Everybody Votes was like.

876
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,040
I'm just going to say one thing,

877
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,660
which is my idea of having the voting be on Zoom or Discord would address this

878
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,160
because then it would be public again.

879
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,180
And that's why I'd already thought about it.

880
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,860
But I don't know.

881
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,280
I think I think I probably agree with Alison that it would be better to have the voting lists

882
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,400
be out in the open.

883
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:21,120
And I do think we probably need to be careful that we don't change big things about how WUSPERS works by accident by going online.

884
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,500
And that probably is one of them.

885
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,660
Mark Protection Committee or anything else on Trial Committee?

886
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,760
Mark Protection Committee.

887
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,180
So Mark Protection Committee.

888
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:34,860
Nicholas White, Alan Bond and Chris Rose have been elected to the MPC and will therefore be protecting marks.

889
00:44:35,400 --> 00:45:01,780
And Nicholas White inadvertently had quite a big influence on this owing to a shortcoming in the WUSPERS voting system where basically something he warned about back in 2022 came to pass where if you have a sort of one person who has suggested a slate and lots of people agree with that slate, that slate will basically be the winners because there's no way of ensuring diversity in the results.

890
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:08,320
I do want to say one thing, which is Nicholas has suggested multiple motions to the business meeting since pointing this floor out.

891
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,100
And as far as I can tell, has not proposed a motion to fix it.

892
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,140
So, Nicholas, I would quite like that to be something that happens.

893
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,380
I don't know whether you need help with that.

894
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,120
Liz has some good ideas.

895
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:26,580
But if you do need assistance and co-proposers, please write in because it needs fixing and we should probably fix things when we notice they're broken.

896
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,920
Liz, you went to Cambridge.

897
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,260
Yes, which is completely irrelevant.

898
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:43,620
Except that they recently did an election for the new chancellor of the university, which, by the way, you can now vote for online rather than having to go in person.

899
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,840
And so I voted for it.

900
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,200
And the vote is done by single transferable vote.

901
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:57,540
And so I ended up digging into like the Cambridge University statutes to try and figure out why under their mechanism of STV, they double eliminated on one round.

902
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:03,340
And they had a pretty good like explanation of how like STV works.

903
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:09,280
And I wonder if we could look at some of their wording of how you do STV because they have it set up.

904
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,300
So it's STV for single winner elections and multi winner elections.

905
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:14,980
Yeah.

906
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:21,140
And there might be some good language there that we could use as a base to write something for the business meeting.

907
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,600
But yeah, I mean, I think the other thing is, yes, Nicholas did point this out a few years ago.

908
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,880
But the fact that he pointed it out and maybe just because he hasn't proposed anything, no one else has proposed anything.

909
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,100
So maybe it was felt at the time that no one thought it was a priority to update this.

910
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,540
And so no one is on it.

911
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:47,340
But I think we probably should be at least proposing to make it work how multi winner STV works in other situations, which seems a bit more sensible.

912
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Yeah, I think that would be good.

913
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,660
And I think, you know, Nicholas Allen and Chris will be good people on the NPC.

914
00:46:52,660 --> 00:47:00,660
But I do I do think given that there's a flaw that has been noticed and subsequently has had an effect.

915
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,120
I think we we now fix it.

916
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,840
That's how that's how Wusfus works.

917
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,920
We're quite good at that in the Worldcon community.

918
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,880
Thing went wrong.

919
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,640
We fix now.

920
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,500
We're not always good.

921
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:15,240
Not always good at things not going wrong, although we are quite good at things not going wrong generally, despite the memes.

922
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,300
But yeah, I think I think this would be good to fix.

923
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,620
And then also on the NPC very quickly.

924
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:27,820
There is now a way to remove members from the NPC, which previously was not possible.

925
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:32,400
Shortly before this was ratified, Ben Yallo resigned from the NPC.

926
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,040
It is an exercise left to the reader as to whether these two things were connected.

927
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,980
They were.

928
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:45,820
To be fair, I have just looked again at the regulations for single transferable vote and they're quite long.

929
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:53,780
And there was some I mean, the fair enough is that we also do have like a lot of definitions in there as well.

930
00:47:53,780 --> 00:48:01,900
But there was some issue that people saying, actually, we may have issues with the length of motions for Wusfus business meetings.

931
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,640
And people probably prefer short ones to long ones.

932
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:17,880
And so if we say I would like to take this one line explanation of voting and replace it with this three page explanation of voting about how you move a surplus as long as, you know, round up to the next whole number or maybe round up second decimal place.

933
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,780
It's going to possibly need to be simplified a bit.

934
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,520
I think there's no reason that the Wusfus constitution couldn't have appendices.

935
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,420
Absolutely.

936
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:33,140
You could just say as described in appendix A and then have appendix A be full Wusnames.

937
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,780
Yeah.

938
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,260
We're also going to discuss E.2.

939
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:49,520
So E.2 was a change to the Wusfus constitution that made it so the words Wusfus member were struck and replaced with supporting member throughout the constitution.

940
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,440
And the words attending supplement was struck and replaced with the words attending member throughout the constitution.

941
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:02,280
I started out thinking that this was silly and then it became clear that it was very, very silly later in the day.

942
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:08,260
This is something that was coming up for ratification at Seattle having been passed at Glasgow.

943
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,120
And I don't think I was in the room when it was voted on at Glasgow.

944
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:16,940
There is a great infographic by Andrew January and I have posted it in the show notes.

945
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:24,500
It goes through 11 scenarios and it explains how the processes used to work in the old days.

946
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:30,700
And it explains how they do under a Wusfus membership with attending supplement model, which is the current mode.

947
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:35,200
I want to say a couple of things, which is firstly, Nicholas White pointed out that technically speaking,

948
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,780
E.2 would mean that only supporting members could vote in the Hugo Awards.

949
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,120
And that was clearly not good.

950
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,740
I think that was a fair point.

951
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:50,160
But I think even without that, this was a poorly motivated change.

952
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,100
And I think reading Andrew's infographic, it becomes very clear.

953
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,840
Buying a ticket to something like Comic-Con is easy.

954
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,320
You buy a ticket, you go to Comic-Con.

955
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,180
That is the end of the process.

956
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,500
That is the end of the explanations.

957
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,300
Everyone is happy.

958
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,400
Everyone has had a good time.

959
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,800
The problem with Worldcon is that Worldcon is an unincorporated...

960
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,180
Well, no.

961
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:12,300
Worldcon is an event run by an unincorporated member society called Wusfus.

962
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,140
And Wusfus membership gives you certain rights which you have if you are a member of the Worldcon.

963
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:23,760
If you are only an attendee of the Worldcon, which would apply, for example, if you bought a day ticket to Worldcon, you do not get these rights.

964
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,020
And Wusfus members have these rights.

965
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,560
And it used to be that if you sold your Worldcon membership, the rights went with it.

966
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,600
And if you'd already used the rights, then they didn't go with it.

967
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:38,620
And that was viewed to be bad because no one should be able to have a Worldcon membership without being able to exercise their rights.

968
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,400
So we made it so that the rights were non-transferable and that was considered to be better.

969
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,160
And the core problem here is that Wusfus is complicated.

970
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:53,940
The core problem here is that running an event, which is technically speaking, an event run by this unincorporated body,

971
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:59,920
which gives you certain rights and is run as a democracy and has business meetings and awards and site selection, all of these things,

972
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,140
is more complicated than hiring some people to run an event and then selling tickets to the event.

973
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,940
And there are some people who are like, no, the problem is that we're using the words Wusfus membership.

974
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,220
No, that is not the problem.

975
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,660
That is accurately describing the actual situation.

976
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,140
The situation is complicated.

977
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,320
It does need explaining.

978
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:23,240
I would argue the complication of the situation is one of the strengths of Worldcon fandom.

979
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,420
I think it's a real strength that we have this thing called Wusfus that is quite complicated and gives you rights and is run as a democracy.

980
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:33,760
And I do not want to see us abandon that because I think it's one of the hallmarks of what makes this convention good.

981
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,400
But I think if you think Wusfus is a good thing, if you think the Hugo Awards are good,

982
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,880
and if you think running Wusfus as a democracy is good, and you think site selection is good,

983
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:51,920
and you think the Worldcon moving around the world is good, then it is very difficult to work out a way of doing this that is less complicated than describing how it works accurately.

984
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,740
And that is my basic opinion.

985
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,800
And so I'm glad that we have repealed this because I think what we need to do is just work out how to explain it well,

986
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,340
and then people will understand it.

987
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,940
Because I don't think it's rocket science.

988
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,820
It's just more complicated than buying a ticket to Comic-Con.

989
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,040
But that's fine.

990
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,840
But also, if you buy a ticket to Comic-Con, you buy a day pass to Comic-Con,

991
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:17,480
this is only for people who want to come to the Worldcon, which is the vast majority of our members,

992
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,960
want to come to Worldcon for the entire five days of the thing.

993
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,400
Because our day tickets are still day tickets.

994
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,980
I mean, sometimes we call them day memberships, but they're not really, you don't get Wusfus voting rights with them.

995
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:32,240
You can just turn up and buy a ticket for the day and enjoy a day at the Worldcon.

996
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:39,460
It's only when you want to shove your face fully into the trough of Worldcon that you need at that point to know,

997
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:46,000
oh, actually, not only is it fan run, but it's run by an Athenian democracy, essentially,

998
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,820
that everybody has an equal say in what is done.

999
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,740
That is not actually true, but as we know, but it's in theory.

1000
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:58,600
And it should appeal to the sort of people for whom that's not actually a bad thing.

1001
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,880
That's actually quite a good thing.

1002
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:06,820
I was quite taken by the arguments that were proposed that actually supporting attending was easier to explain to people on desks,

1003
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,040
which some people were in favour of and some people weren't.

1004
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,240
But I mean, I think that's fair enough.

1005
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,820
But basically, I don't particularly care what it's called as long as we can explain it to people.

1006
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:21,840
But I do take the argument that we, this was like a one line motion,

1007
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,320
which would then have knock on effects in about 20 other bits of the constitution.

1008
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,560
And so you really shouldn't pass that.

1009
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,680
And I was quite glad we then reconsidered it and voted against it.

1010
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,940
I think rather than have a big more debate about what we should be calling memberships and so on.

1011
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:43,780
I think the interesting thing to me is that because the business meetings were a week apart,

1012
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:51,340
what happened here and also what happened on another motion is that you could basically go and spend a week thinking about it

1013
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:56,400
and talking about it on discord with people and then come back again.

1014
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:04,300
So, for instance, there was a proposal on generative AI, which basically went to committee and they totally rewrote it between sessions and came back.

1015
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,740
And I think was a much better proposal that was then voted on.

1016
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,680
And in this case, we could then go away.

1017
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,960
And Andrew had time to make a flow chart and go, oh, actually, we've accidentally made it.

1018
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,620
So attending members could no longer vote in the Hugos.

1019
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,960
And then that was quite a powerful argument for reconsidering it and then striking it down.

1020
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:25,800
And that would be quite hard to do at the live meeting because you don't have a week.

1021
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,960
You have like a day or two during which time a lot of people are very busy being at a WorldCom.

1022
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,860
So I suspect if we'd done this live in Seattle, we might have passed that and never reconsidered it and got ourselves into a pickle.

1023
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,560
So I have like I have I have I have three things to say here.

1024
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:50,720
I think the point about explaining on desks, I think if you go to Andrew's page and you read through, it was complicated before and it's complicated now.

1025
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,780
And the thing that's actually changed is that people were familiar with the old system and people are less familiar with the new system.

1026
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:10,640
And I certainly find when I teach physics in my day job, listeners, I am better at teaching the parts of physics that I use every day than I am at teaching the parts of physics that I basically only think about when I'm teaching undergraduates or when I was an undergraduate myself.

1027
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,900
And familiarity has a massive impact on how easy you find it to explain things.

1028
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:28,040
But I think this is a clear indication that what we actually need is to work on how we explain it, because I don't think there's a fundamental difference in complexity, because I think the complexity is an inherent property of the WorldCom.

1029
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,600
I think it's just how we explain it changed.

1030
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,440
And I think this was a point made very well by Meg MacDonald in the business meeting itself.

1031
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:51,980
She pointed out that the business meet in the business meeting, she pointed out to those who might have been recalcitrant to reconsider E2 that Glasgow had 1390 First WorldCom members in the first year that this new system was under effect for a WorldCom.

1032
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,360
And they did not find it too complicated.

1033
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,140
And that's an underestimate because the Scottish rate was cheaper.

1034
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,540
So there were people who bought that rate who were also First WorldCom.

1035
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,520
I think the same might have been true of young adults.

1036
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,760
So that is, there were at least, there were at least 1400 First WorldCom attendees.

1037
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,400
I don't know how much I think this complexity puts people off.

1038
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:18,160
And it might be that if we get rid of all the complexity and made it a ticketed event, we'd hit like 20,000 attendees every WorldCom.

1039
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,780
But I sort of doubt it.

1040
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:25,800
But I think if people are leaving the desk thinking that it's complicated, that reflects badly on us for having explained it badly.

1041
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,020
But again, I think it's inherently complicated.

1042
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,800
And I don't think there's a way of changing that without making WorldCom into something it isn't.

1043
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,100
And I do think we probably need to think quite carefully about how to explain this.

1044
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,700
And we probably need to like practice.

1045
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,640
Which I know people don't usually do like role plays before going on a comm desk.

1046
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,540
But maybe we need them too.

1047
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,000
On short motions, I agree with you.

1048
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,940
Short motions are bad.

1049
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:49,120
This motion should have gone through every single place it touched the Constitution.

1050
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,900
And should have done the strikeouts and replacements explicitly.

1051
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,040
Because that's how a good motion is drafted.

1052
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,700
And this whole, well, we'll just do it shortly so that it's not a lot of words.

1053
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,260
It's like, no, do not.

1054
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,140
Do the work.

1055
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,800
Do not make other people do the work.

1056
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,000
And do not open it to be bad if you've done the work and missed something.

1057
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,740
Thirdly, completely agree with you.

1058
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,780
Having meetings a week apart is great because it means people can actually think about things and have discussions.

1059
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,660
And you get that development.

1060
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,380
And I think that's really good.

1061
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,480
And I think being able to do that like on Discord and stuff is also really good.

1062
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,400
Those are my three responses.

1063
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:28,480
But maybe we should be asking people who don't come to business meetings because they haven't been to 27 World Cons.

1064
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,800
Is this one more complicated?

1065
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,100
Yeah, I'm not suggesting we do a big survey.

1066
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:39,080
I'm suggesting that we do have a pool of people who've obviously managed to buy memberships despite them being probably a bit complicated.

1067
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,700
And if you had some wording, you could like test it on a handful of people.

1068
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,720
We got rid of the retro Hugos.

1069
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:45,860
Yeah, we did.

1070
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,360
We got rid of them.

1071
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:52,260
I mean, I think my views on the retro Hugos have been given at length.

1072
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,840
It does seem to have made some people a bit unhappy because they felt there were not many years left to go.

1073
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,400
And so we should just go with it.

1074
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:05,920
I did feel the point that while it's optional for each World Con and a lot of them have chosen to stop doing this,

1075
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,940
it means that maybe they will naturally die out unless there's a con who are really keen.

1076
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,180
But in the end, I'm happier to just get rid of them.

1077
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,340
Yeah, I think that's fair.

1078
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:21,120
Basically, I was very un... I didn't really mind either way.

1079
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,960
They don't offend me, but I also don't pay much attention to them.

1080
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,840
So I was quite happy for it to be either.

1081
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:38,740
And that was basically reflected by the consultative vote, which was, you know, largely... I think it very slightly edged one way towards keeping it clear that the members are roughly evenly split.

1082
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:44,180
Yeah, and I feel it's one of those things where we can't give them out as retro Hugos officially.

1083
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:55,280
But if a con was really keen and they were 75 years after a missing year, they could still have some program about them or even, you know, run some non-world con awards if they wanted to,

1084
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:07,120
or do something to raise awareness of the science fiction of 75 years in the past, which would maybe be a bit less of an administrative thing than running a whole retro Hugo process.

1085
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,780
And then having a bunch of retro Hugos where you have to work out who should get the trophies and so on.

1086
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:16,740
How many special Hugo awards is one convention allowed to give out?

1087
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,900
I think it's one.

1088
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:18,800
One.

1089
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,800
I don't think you're allowed to sneakily run 27 extra retro Hugos.

1090
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,680
Boom!

1091
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,360
I see where you're going, John.

1092
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,400
But you could do a special Hugo award for best novel of 19, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1093
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,280
Ooh, no, but because if you could, you know what you could do?

1094
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,640
You could run all the previous retro Hugos that we haven't already done in one year and just be done.

1095
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,180
We'll just have one year with like 100 Hugos.

1096
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,400
You could also make them committee awards. You could just award them.

1097
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:52,640
Not more than one special category may be created by the current Worldcon committee.

1098
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,860
And I assume you can't award multiple awards in that one special category.

1099
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,980
I assume they've thought of that.

1100
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,680
Voting to be the same as for the permanent categories.

1101
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,760
So you can't suddenly turn it into multi-winner STV.

1102
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,600
Boo!

1103
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,900
Well, I tried.

1104
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:17,460
And I believe we're not supposed to put anything else on the ballot with the Hugo awards apart from the not-a-Hugos.

1105
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,780
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1106
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:24,000
So you can't sneakily put them on the Hugo ballot and then give them a Hugo award.

1107
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,380
Glasgow has announced their Smofcon 42 bursaries.

1108
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,880
We were going to talk about Worldcon finances, but we've run long this time, listeners.

1109
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,200
So we will discuss that in a future episode.

1110
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:46,040
But we wanted to mention the bursaries because there is a deadline of the 31st of August.

1111
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,080
There is a link in the show notes.

1112
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,300
And we encourage people to go and check it out if they're interested in attending Smofcon.

1113
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:59,980
Yeah, and I mean, I think I want to say a little bit, which is that I applied and got a Smofcon bursary to the Smofcon in Lisbon,

1114
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:05,100
in least in part because the chair of Dublin 2019, James Bacon, said, do not self-exclude in general.

1115
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,220
I took his advice to heart.

1116
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:13,800
And it doesn't matter how committed, you know, you need to want to run conventions of some types,

1117
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,340
but it could be from the most simple to the most ginormous.

1118
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,800
And people from all backgrounds are encouraged to apply.

1119
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:24,160
And I'd strongly recommend it if you think you might like it.

1120
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,780
Also, Stockholm is nice, but that shouldn't necessarily sway you.

1121
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:32,260
Stockholm is perhaps not as nice in early December as it was in late June.

1122
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,220
But it is crucially a European Smofcon.

1123
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,700
And I'm not sure when the next European Smofcon bid is at the moment.

1124
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,240
So if you want to go to one and you're a European, this is a good year.

1125
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,440
Yeah, Lisbon one was fantastic.

1126
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:48,640
And just some very quick updates from a previous episode.

1127
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:54,020
The Montreal bid has now announced that the co-chairs for the Worldcon, should there be seated,

1128
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,000
are Bruce Farr and Darren Briskman.

1129
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,920
And if those names seem familiar, that's because they're the bid chairs, listeners.

1130
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,780
So yes, that has now been.

1131
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,200
That is now official.

1132
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,200
Demonstrating the benefit of people sniping on the internet

1133
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,660
because we and other people said it would be good to know who these are.

1134
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,300
And now they've announced them.

1135
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,260
No doubt because people were saying you should announce this.

1136
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:25,940
Are we on to picks?

1137
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,940
Mm-hmm.

1138
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:27,820
Hey.

1139
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,620
I rather think we are.

1140
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:33,420
I'm going to pick that little known indie film, Superman.

1141
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,200
Great.

1142
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,180
Just because I went to see Superman and I thought it was really pretty good.

1143
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,920
And a lot of my other reading and listening and watching has been Hugo finalists.

1144
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,720
So they'll get more commentary when the Hugo finalists are announced.

1145
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,260
Sorry, final results are announced.

1146
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,300
Yeah, I went to see Superman.

1147
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,300
I don't know if you two have seen it.

1148
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,020
No.

1149
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:51,560
No, not yet.

1150
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,580
It's on the list.

1151
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:57,640
Odd for me to be the most timely and topical one by watching a film three weeks after it came out.

1152
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,220
Superhero movie.

1153
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,920
But people say it's very good.

1154
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,620
It is.

1155
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:02,840
So I think it is pretty good.

1156
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:08,120
I mean, I was not a big fan of the DC era where everything was a bit dark and gritty.

1157
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:13,700
This just feels like a sort of fairly like classic Superman film.

1158
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,360
And I think it makes a few interesting choices.

1159
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:21,720
So cover your ears if you don't want to hear anything about the interesting choices from the very early on in the film.

1160
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:27,580
One thing it does is basically it cuts out what might be the opening act of the film, essentially.

1161
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:31,080
We start in with a lot of stuff already having happened.

1162
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:36,040
We already have the situation set up that Superman essentially at a low point.

1163
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,000
He's just been defeated by a hero.

1164
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,860
He's lying in the snow outside his fortress of solitude.

1165
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,200
He's at a low point.

1166
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,780
And we don't do origin story.

1167
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,760
We don't do any of that.

1168
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:57,540
We sort of skip straight in at this point where we learn that in the past Superman has tried to stop a war between two countries and then been defeated by the supposed hero of one of these countries who've come back.

1169
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,340
Of course, we find out pretty quickly this is all Lex Luthor's plot.

1170
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:05,940
But it's interesting that by choosing to skip all that, it means we can spend two hours on Superman.

1171
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:14,360
And it makes what might otherwise have been quite a long film into something where they have a bit more space to explore with Superman already established.

1172
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,360
I thought that was interesting.

1173
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:29,560
The second thing is that we kind of open with, and this is a tiny spoiler, we open with basically see that Superman and Lois Lane are already in a relationship and she knows that Superman is Clark Kent, which is an interesting choice as well.

1174
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,400
And I felt they both work pretty well.

1175
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,580
I don't think we need to do the whole like, yes, he landed on a farm in Kansas.

1176
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:39,420
Obviously, we do see the farm in Kansas and we do see Superman's parents because he goes back there at a low point.

1177
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,760
And, you know, they give him a we'll always love you.

1178
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,680
You'll always be our son kind of thing.

1179
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:49,620
So it sticks very much to those sort of classic, classic beats, but it has space to do a bit of stuff around them.

1180
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,920
There's maybe a little bit too much of Crypto the Wonder Dog.

1181
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,520
And I'm surprised I'm saying that because I'm like Crypto the Wonder Dog, that'd be great.

1182
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,940
But maybe a little bit too much of him.

1183
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,240
I think Luthor is pretty good.

1184
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:05,480
But you miss a bit by by not having any like of the prior relationship between Luther and Superman.

1185
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,880
You miss out a bit there.

1186
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,280
There's not a lot of Daily Planet.

1187
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:13,640
You only really see Clark Kent once and you maybe don't get enough of like, I thought Perry White, you'd like to see more of him.

1188
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,180
You don't get a lot of that.

1189
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,320
But it's just a sort of pretty classic tale.

1190
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:22,880
And you spend a lot of time like with Superman in the sunlight, brightly lit in a bright blue suit.

1191
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,100
Fucking good.

1192
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,280
And that is enjoyable.

1193
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,160
And it made me laugh.

1194
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:30,980
And it's got enough nods to other other bits of DC that you'll enjoy it.

1195
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,680
It does a little tiny bit too much set up for future films.

1196
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,620
One in particular that I won't go into too much because I think it probably is a bit too much for a spoiler.

1197
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:40,300
But it's a bit like, did you really have to do that?

1198
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,720
That kind of undercuts some other stuff.

1199
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,900
But yeah, I just liked it as like, OK, here is Superman.

1200
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:52,760
He is this big, bright hero who is trying to make good choices and do the best he can and gives you that for two hours.

1201
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:55,060
Oh, and you get Mr Terrific and Mr Terrific is great.

1202
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,520
Surely he's terrific.

1203
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,680
I nearly said Mr Terrific is terrific, but I thought, is that too much of a joke?

1204
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,640
But he just is.

1205
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,860
He's just played very well.

1206
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:07,600
And, you know, he has his T-spheres and his T-craft and all this sort of stuff.

1207
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,820
And he gets what is probably the best action scene.

1208
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:15,060
One of the things I love about the Marvel films is where they bring in obscure people I've never heard of.

1209
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,280
And I'm like, well, this is clearly great.

1210
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:20,060
And I've never heard of Mr Terrific, but that makes me really want to go and see Superman.

1211
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,680
There were characters in it that I never heard of that clearly established DC figures.

1212
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,160
There's ones where I'm like, oh, I kind of recognize that name.

1213
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:26,920
You're a DC person.

1214
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:35,340
And then they was also bringing the engineer who I am aware of, but only from when the engineer was still off in like the Wild Storm universe in the authority.

1215
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,600
And then at some point they came back into mainline DC.

1216
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,240
And I have not paid any attention to that.

1217
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,880
But that was kind of interesting that they are bringing in some of these slightly minor characters.

1218
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:50,160
But you also get Superman, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen and Crypto the Wonder Dog and Lex Luthor.

1219
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,740
And yeah, it's got enough classic stuff.

1220
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,320
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

1221
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,600
I think I'm going to see it next weekend, but we shall see.

1222
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:04,180
I'm going to pick One Soul, which is a graphic novel by Ray Fawkes, which was released in 2011.

1223
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:08,440
So I've got my finger on the beating heart of the genre.

1224
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:14,100
So what this is, is a book which starts.

1225
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,480
So every page is a nine panel page.

1226
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,200
So every spread is 18 panels of this comic.

1227
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,560
And it's drawn in black and white.

1228
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:28,980
And each of the 18 panels in each spread is a separate person.

1229
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:39,000
And the book takes you through each of these people's lives from their sort of inception up to their deaths.

1230
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:46,440
And so you can just read it as a normal comic where you like read one page at a time until you get to the end.

1231
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:57,920
But I found that what I ended up often doing was I read it like that until something happened in a story that caught my interest or that like I didn't quite understand what happened.

1232
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:04,980
And I would go back and read that, like reread that person's journey up to that point to remind myself what had been going on.

1233
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,120
And as a consequence, I don't know how many times I read each page.

1234
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:19,220
But like it's the first time I've ever, other than like adventure game books, it's the first time I've ever kind of skipped backwards and forwards and had my fingers in multiple pages.

1235
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:27,400
And like it's really interesting how it encourages you or it's really interesting how it doesn't encourage you to read it non-linearly.

1236
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,980
But I did anyway.

1237
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:37,760
I don't know if it's genre particularly, other than obviously there's like a cross-section between graphic novels and genre generally.

1238
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,400
It's, but it is really, it's really interesting.

1239
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,960
And I, I very much enjoyed it.

1240
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:57,280
The author, Ray Fawkes, has worked on various versions, sort of, you know, worked on Constantine, worked on various Batman novels, like worked on Justice League.

1241
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,840
So it has done a bunch of work for DC and Marvel and Dark Horse.

1242
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,520
But this is like his own thing.

1243
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,080
And I went to the launch of this graphic novel on my TAF trip.

1244
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,540
And I fully intended to read the copy that Colin Hines bought while you're at the launch.

1245
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:11,620
And then I did not.

1246
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,940
And I have gone back to it many years later.

1247
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:16,940
And I'm glad I did because it was really, really good.

1248
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,220
Sounds really nice.

1249
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,460
Sounds like it might be a terrible one to try and read digitally.

1250
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:27,580
Yeah, I really think you would want to read it in physical.

1251
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:32,140
I don't really know what the experience of reading it digitally would be like.

1252
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,880
But I think it would lose some thing.

1253
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:42,480
Actually, and I don't know whether it's for sale digitally because it was published before that, like before Comixology had gotten really big.

1254
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,360
So it may well be that it's hard to find.

1255
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,400
Although I haven't looked, so I might be wrong.

1256
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,480
You are wrong.

1257
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,700
Am I? Excellent.

1258
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:54,360
Yeah, you can get it on Kindle or rather, which presumably turns out to be like in the Kindle read or whatever.

1259
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,500
So I mean, and.

1260
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,460
Ah, they did it.

1261
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,460
They did a tan.

1262
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,020
Only Press did a.

1263
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,200
So it's published by Only Press, but Only Press did a 10th anniversary edition.

1264
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,080
Ah.

1265
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,420
That makes sense.

1266
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:07,460
So, yeah, because 2021 was after Comixology was popular.

1267
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:10,420
Actually, it's it's on Kindle Unlimited at the moment.

1268
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:14,120
And I bought Kindle Unlimited for the month because I was doing a lot of reading last month.

1269
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,680
So I might just read it.

1270
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,060
Is that the end?

1271
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,600
No, because Alison needs to talk about beer.

1272
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,060
Oh, Alison didn't do a pit yet.

1273
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,660
Oh, I forgot Alison was still thinking about beer.

1274
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,100
No, I'm going to.

1275
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:25,760
I have.

1276
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,120
I'm going to talk about beer.

1277
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,920
I've been in the Lake District and I was going to do lots of reading, but I didn't because what am I like?

1278
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,720
But I did do lots of walking and a lot of sitting around in the sunshine.

1279
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:44,540
And what's even nicer, sitting around in the light cloud, which is is what perfect English summer weather is like so that it doesn't get too hot.

1280
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:54,440
And one of the things about the Lake District is that you find excellently preserved examples of things that have largely disappeared from other parts of the UK.

1281
01:10:54,440 --> 01:11:02,080
And one of them appears to be Cask Bitter, where there are lots of microbreweries in the Lake District now or close to the Lake District.

1282
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,680
They're probably not mostly in the Lake District.

1283
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,900
We found one where I was like, are they really brewing in this valley?

1284
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:15,020
And they said to us, oh, no, we ship the water from the valley to Kendall and then they make beer and ship it back, which I thought was quite funny.

1285
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:26,400
But yes, so all of the pubs practically had really good beer and all of the pubs had really nice Cask beer, including Cask Bitter, which is obviously the best thing in the world.

1286
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:32,620
And there is nothing nicer on this earth than to go for a nice walk and at the end of it have a nice pint of bitter.

1287
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:37,140
And, you know, I might be biased, but you know, you should all do this.

1288
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,900
Lake District continues to be very nice.

1289
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,940
Everyone keeps going, oh, but it's just got a good press agent.

1290
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:47,660
And there are other places that are just as nice in the English countryside, but aren't the Lake District.

1291
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:52,420
And I am here to say I looked all over the UK for places with lakes.

1292
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:57,040
And Scotland's got some big lakes, but the countryside is more rugged.

1293
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,420
And other places, whenever you zoom in on a lake, it turns out to be a reservoir and they are not as good.

1294
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,080
So Lake District is the best.

1295
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:09,000
It's also a bit crowded, but we found some non-crowded parts of it.

1296
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,300
So and you can always go at a time that's not July.

1297
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,520
So, yes, bitter.

1298
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,240
It's good.

1299
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,020
It shouldn't die out.

1300
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,040
You shouldn't let it die out.

1301
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,220
You should go and drink it and ask people to make it well and serve it well.

1302
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:26,060
And it doesn't transport terribly well, which is one of the reasons it's not as popular as it might be.

1303
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:31,480
It comes in casks and it needs to not travel too far and the casks need to be looked after.

1304
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,300
But it's so nice when it's done well.

1305
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,020
Fair enough.

1306
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,880
That was the Octothorpe podcast.

1307
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,280
And it's goodbye from me.

1308
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,580
It's goodbye from me.

1309
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,860
And it's goodbye from me.

1310
01:12:39,860 --> 01:13:04,220
I've got to reboot because Audacity is not working.

1311
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,480
Oh, that's hilarious.

1312
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,320
This is the air I always get, which I know is fixed with just rebooting my laptop.

1313
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,700
So see you in a minute.

1314
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:13,000
Ta-ta.

1315
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,140
The cursed episode.

1316
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,700
Summer of fun.

1317
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:25,320
I nearly made Alison choke listeners.

1318
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,200
No regrets.

1319
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,740
Hashtag YOLO.

1320
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,100
Sorry.

1321
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:31,220
Sorry.

1322
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:49,440
Just to make it very funny, which you'll remember on the edit and it will make you laugh all over again.
