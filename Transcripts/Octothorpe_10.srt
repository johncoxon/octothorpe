1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,700
Alison, if you could look confused, I'll just take a sneaky screenshot of the Zoom.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,740
How does everyone look confused?

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,400
A bit like that.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:22,560
Hello everyone and welcome to the 10th episode of Octothorpe,

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,380
a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom. I'm John Coxon.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,540
I'm Alison Scott.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,440
And I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,880
And we have several letters of comment this week.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,700
And we have Max who has written in to tell us that she beats Crazy Dave.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,000
She listens at 3x speed.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,120
And she says that she wishes we could speed up pub chats too.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,580
And this gave me the idea for a panel show,

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,460
which is to have people listen to podcasts at various speeds,

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,060
see how much they understand,

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,420
and then have them drink alcohol and then repeat the process

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,580
until they're too drunk to understand any words.

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,760
And I think this could be funny to do at a convention.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,020
Okay, so I have a theory that we should speed up Tobes

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,640
and see if anyone can understand him at any speed.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,120
Yes!

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,920
Yes!

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,840
A hundred percent yes.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,140
Because I once had a conversation with Tobes where I was drunk and he wasn't,

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,040
and I understood everything he said perfectly.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,620
And I felt that I'd been, and he talked a lot of sense,

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,480
and I felt that I might have been missing something for all the previous years of my life.

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,640
Espana will tell you that she doesn't understand Tobes even when he's sober.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,780
But she lies.

29
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,920
She does understand really.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,880
Also, happy birthday Tobes,

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,980
because it was Tobes' birthday the day before yesterday,

32
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,760
as we record,

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,180
which is the 19th of July, 2020.

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,940
We should say here that we mean,

35
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,180
when we say Tobes,

36
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,780
we mean Tobes Valois,

37
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,880
Scion of the Valois Kings.

38
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,180
Rightful King of France.

39
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,240
Liz, any thoughts on French aristocracy?

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,940
I have no thoughts on French aristocracy.

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,440
Okay.

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,600
It's always worth checking.

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,380
On the subject of Crazy Dave,

44
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,540
he sent us an email,

45
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:05,280
and he basically says that he doesn't tend to vote in the BSFA awards,

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,860
and he wishes that the number of Hugo finalists would go back down to five,

47
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,200
now that the puppies have gone silent,

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,100
because he finds he sometimes doesn't get around to reading all of the books,

49
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,260
and he doesn't like voting if he hasn't read everything.

50
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:26,340
But he thanks us for reminding him that you can actually just not finish the things you're not enjoying,

51
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,740
because that probably has ramifications or implications for whether or not you'll think it's the best of the bunch.

52
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,840
But he does know he has mostly managed to finish all of the Hugo finalists in recent years because of his commute,

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:48,320
but notes that the lockdown has somewhat hurt that method of keeping in touch with the finalists.

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,140
At the time we go out, you'll have about minus one days to vote in the Hugos.

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,700
There is a slender chance this will go out on the day of the deadline,

56
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,140
but it might well be the day after.

57
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,980
So if you haven't voted, it's probably too late, but you know, you could get reading.

58
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,560
Sorry.

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,340
So, Mark Plummer has sent us a poem, which I will now read to you dramatically.

60
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,780
Shouldn't we each read our own?

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,640
Oh yeah, we could each read our own stanza.

62
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,560
Yes, please.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,580
We do have to note before we do this that Mark has written this

64
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,300
in an order which is different to the order in which we say hello.

65
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,880
Please do not be alarmed.

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,580
This is artistic choice and it is valid and important.

67
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,340
Are you going to explain why he sent us this?

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:41,440
So, last episode we asked all of our listeners to send us poetry and Clara Hughes about members of the podcast,

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,460
and me and Alison and Liz.

70
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,700
And Mark sent us two poems in response to this challenge.

71
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:54,200
One was a Clara Hughes about me, which is not going to be broadcast, but we all thoroughly enjoyed.

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,780
And Liz came up with a reaction, Clara Hughes, to that.

73
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,060
Liz, do you want me to read your poem or would you like to read your poem?

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm happy for you to read my poem because I have lost the email with it in.

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,220
But I think it may be a limerick rather than a Clara Hughes because I don't know what a Clara Hughes is.

76
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,240
And here we go.

77
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:23,160
This is Untitled Limerick by Elizabeth Batty, age 34 and a quarter.

78
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,300
Is that how old you are?

79
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,800
No.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,360
Close?

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,560
Reasonably close.

82
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,780
On the flattering side, so we're okay.

83
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,480
Yay!

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,740
The poems of Croydon van Plummer entertain Octothorpe for the summer.

85
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,000
Though his rhymes are first class, they're too rude to broadcast, which is really a bit of a bummer.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,600
Thank you, Liz.

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,480
And now, have we all got the email from Markup?

88
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,060
Excellent.

89
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,740
So, Dr John the Boy Coxon didn't notice several locks on Octothorpe because he hadn't checked,

90
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,060
and thus he failed to mark protect.

91
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,780
Liz Batty, also doctor, didn't know so many people had locked her.

92
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,300
Octothorpe's a fan-ish gestalt, but in this respect, it's all John's fault.

93
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,640
Guff winner Alison Scott has several novas, and she has also got two Hugos for the fanzine

94
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,820
plocta, but unlike John and Liz, she's...

95
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,720
Fremulon.

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,900
Shh, not a doctor.

97
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,740
This ends Octothorpe Poetry Corner.

98
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,940
No, but, you know, we're happy to do it again.

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Please send us more poems.

100
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,340
Yes, absolutely.

101
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,320
Oh, yes.

102
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,600
Please send us more poetry.

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,640
Please keep sending us poems.

104
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,880
Ideally, you go for faintly rude, but not as rude as Mark's previous one.

105
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,100
I have to say, if I was responsible for editing this podcast, we'd have broadcast it, but that's

106
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,620
just me.

107
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,200
Ha ha ha.

108
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,240
Alison, you are currently on New Zealand time.

109
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,260
That's not so.

110
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,540
Or Australia time.

111
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,040
I am currently on Sydney time, which is nine hours ahead of the UK.

112
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,800
It is therefore currently 9.36pm as we record, which is significantly later than we usually

113
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,260
record.

114
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,980
So I wasn't quite sure.

115
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,200
I sort of said, I will do a virtual guff trip and I would have loads and loads of brilliant

116
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
ideas and I will make them all happen.

117
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,800
And then I probably forgot about it until my diary was like, oh, John and Liz are like,

118
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,660
this is what Alison is like.

119
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,560
And my diary was like, your virtual guff trip starts today.

120
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,300
And I was like, oh, I suppose it should.

121
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,120
So I started setting up meetups and I've now have meetups in Seattle on a stopover and in

122
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:43,100
Perth, a couple of times in Perth and in Adelaide and in Melbourne, where we spent most of the

123
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,700
time with the Melbourne fans.

124
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,420
Oh, whoops.

125
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:52,100
The Melbourne fans schooling me on how you say the word Melbourne and me not really quite

126
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,720
getting it.

127
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,020
And then this morning, Canberra.

128
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,960
I still have to go to Sydney and then up the east coast of Australia to like all the

129
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,040
bits that have lovely beaches.

130
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,860
And I want to do things.

131
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:11,040
I've been and then I also want to go to Hobart, Tasmania, which is kind of a capital radio joke

132
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,340
and doesn't really have anything to do with an actual love of Hobart at all.

133
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,880
But I am going to get to Tasmania.

134
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,960
And then I've got a couple of days in touring New Zealand before the actual Worldcon starts.

135
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:29,740
Getting on to Australian time was really hard, but I'm on Australian time now and it's fine.

136
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,440
When I've not been doing chats, because it's not just Zoom chats, I have obviously had a lot of

137
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
appropriate Zoom backgrounds.

138
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,200
I have started sketching.

139
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,340
I should have started sketching earlier, but I didn't.

140
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,280
But I have now started sketching.

141
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,780
So there are going to be some sketches of some of the things I'm seeing while I'm there.

142
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,740
The primary thing I'm doing to experience the country is that I use my Oculus Quest, which

143
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,660
has starred in previous episodes of Octathorpe as a way I was staying sane in the apocalypse.

144
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,180
And now I'm using it.

145
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:08,040
I create YouTube playlists of 360 degree videos that I shove my headset on and watch all these

146
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,440
videos.

147
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,720
And oh my God, it's like being there.

148
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,460
It's not always like being there, but sometimes it's like being there.

149
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,000
And this is very exciting to me.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,360
And as a result, I've got to experience a load of authentic tourist experiences, like going

151
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:30,540
on a dolphin watching boat trip around Rottnest Island and walking around botanical gardens.

152
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,220
There's some things about Australia.

153
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,340
Space is very big, but it doesn't have anything on Australia, which is absolutely bloody enormous.

154
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,700
It's huge.

155
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,880
Everything in Australia appears to be very big everywhere.

156
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,020
All Australian cities have a set of things.

157
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,340
And they seem to me to reflect colonial history to some degree.

158
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:01,440
So they all have, apart from Canberra, they all have historical buildings, which seem like

159
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,520
to Brits, seem like very ordinary Victorian architecture that in the UK would be in severe

160
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,740
danger of collapsing into disrepair or being torn down in order to make flats.

161
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,860
But these are the exciting historical buildings in Australia.

162
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,520
They all have botanical gardens.

163
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,580
They all have masses of parkland and they all have a jail which has been lovingly restored.

164
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,960
Weird, weird detail.

165
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,120
And they also have, they have a kind of big thing about colonial guilt and debt, which I'm

166
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,940
just kind of getting my head around, seeing as I feel like the British do not have as much

167
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,960
of this, despite the fact that we kind of cause, but in our psyche, it's not such a big thing.

168
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,380
And Australians are lovely and loads of them have come out to see me.

169
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:58,100
And I've done, I've done some actual telepresence things where like going out into the Adelaide

170
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,100
hills with Damien and Juliet while on Juliet's phone and wandering around the centre of Adelaide

171
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,000
with Roman Oszansky on Roman's phone.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,960
And I'm trying to think, do any of you have any questions about it?

173
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,400
So overall, it's going much, it's both better and more interesting than I expected.

174
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,720
That's excellent.

175
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,300
But I'm very tired now and it's only been a week.

176
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,040
I have questions.

177
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,860
So I am curious as to, have you met anyone through this guff trip that, you know, were fans you

178
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,660
didn't know previously?

179
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,460
Or has it been hard to get people who don't already know you to come and join in?

180
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,780
Whereas if you were there in person, it might be easier to get them to come out to meetups,

181
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,160
do you think?

182
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,640
I'd say about the meetups have been half people I already know, but in some cases I

183
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,880
only knew very faintly and half people I didn't know at all.

184
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
That's a terrific ratio.

185
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,840
So roughly even.

186
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,660
And lots of people I don't know.

187
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,900
Some of them I feel I know quite well now.

188
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,420
So I watched, you know, not really properly well, but a bit.

189
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,760
And this is how relationships form over long times, don't they?

190
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,480
So it's not just I had dinner with them and then now we're bosom friends forever normally.

191
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,060
It's you kind of build these things over years.

192
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,140
So there were people I'd met once or twice who I've now spent some more time.

193
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,900
I watched an Aussie rules football game.

194
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,580
Erwin Hirsch said, you must, while you're out here, you must watch an Aussie rules football

195
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:19,940
game.

196
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,040
So I discovered that you can stream them online.

197
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:31,320
So I, at one o'clock Sydney time or 4.05am UK time, I was watching Carlton play Port Adelaide.

198
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,760
I think it's okay now to say the result because it will have been a few days, but I've been

199
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,840
quite careful, which is that Port Adelaide won that at the point where the final whistle

200
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,060
blew, they had a free kick.

201
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,200
So they are allowed to take that free kick and they kicked it into the goal and beat Carlton,

202
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,420
who is Erwin's team by three points.

203
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,900
Oh, that sounds good.

204
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,280
So that was devastating for Erwin.

205
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,620
But I was like, oh, if you're going to watch a random game from a sport you've never seen

206
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,120
before, you could not have asked for a better one.

207
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,440
That is how sports should be.

208
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,500
As far as I can see, Aussie rules football has everything a sporting, a sports ball activity

209
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,320
could require.

210
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,100
It is, it is very fast paced.

211
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,720
A lot of points are scored.

212
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,140
Nothing is properly in control ever.

213
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,120
And it is played by extremely beautiful people.

214
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,740
There's a limit to what you can say in 2020 about spending two and a half hours ogling gorgeous

215
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,320
men whilst talking to equally gorgeous Erwin Hirsch on Discord.

216
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,980
Oh.

217
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,880
Ha ha ha.

218
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,380
Ha ha ha.

219
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,240
This is how we get locks.

220
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,260
This is how we get locks.

221
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,860
We just call our listeners gorgeous.

222
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,600
This is how we get locks.

223
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,340
So I don't think that's offensive quite, but I mean, they're just lovely to look at.

224
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,400
And it's just very entertaining.

225
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,480
It's a good game.

226
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,320
I enjoyed it a lot.

227
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,720
Excellent.

228
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,180
I am not much into sports ball.

229
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,540
I did have to pay.

230
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,340
I thought that was reasonable.

231
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,820
That's one of the biggest expenses.

232
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,500
I would say touring places virtually is very cheap compared to touring them in real life.

233
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,320
Are you saying that your monthly broadband subscription costs you less than a flight halfway around the world?

234
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:20,180
When I'm costing up the virtual guff trip, which I am going to do, I'm going to put things like my order for authentic New Zealand meat pies into the list of expenses.

235
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:30,740
But I'm not putting in either my broadband subscription, which I was paying anyway, or my Oculus Quest, which I did not buy with this in mind at all.

236
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,600
It had never occurred to me I'd be using VR goggles to wander around bits of Australia.

237
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
And I've done some video diaries.

238
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:44,820
So we should probably have a link to the video diaries on the show notes for people who feel that Octothorpe every two weeks is not enough Alison for them.

239
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,280
Yes.

240
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,480
Alison will now put the links in the show notes.

241
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,680
I have six subscribers at the moment.

242
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,640
It's very exciting.

243
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,940
I'm kind of demonstrating how you failed to monetize.

244
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,320
Yeah.

245
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,320
If you'd monetize this channel properly, then you could actually be raising money for guff while on your guff trip.

246
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,420
Probably not really much.

247
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,160
Maybe enough to cover your pie.

248
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,060
That seems fair.

249
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,680
That would be great.

250
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,780
That would be quite funny.

251
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,780
Yeah, I actually have more subscribers to my other channel, to the channel I have under my,

252
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,860
under my Bohemian Coast name, despite the fact that they're just totally random things.

253
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,880
I assume that those subscribers are all bots.

254
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,140
There's two videos so far.

255
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,200
One of them saying no views, which is a bit depressing.

256
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,860
Oh.

257
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,380
I think I really have no views.

258
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:37,720
The virtual guff report, which you'll be very pleased to hear, Claire Brawley of Croydon has volunteered to edit for me.

259
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:47,060
It's going to consist of a vast stack of bits and bobs thrown into an electronic carrier bag and tossed over the wall to her with a kind of,

260
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,300
if you can make any sense out of this, you're doing well, dear.

261
00:14:51,300 --> 00:15:01,120
But it's going to have an appendix on what the technology I've been using is and to what extent that has worked.

262
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:11,180
One of the things I've done is gone for a flying trip with the flying doctors because I am of an age where British people learnt only a very few things about Australia growing up.

263
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,120
And one of the things we learnt about was the flying doctors service.

264
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:23,460
And now, of course, I live in Walthamstone where we have our equivalent of a flying doctor service because it can take so long to get people the two miles from where they've been injured to a hospital.

265
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,420
They send a helicopter.

266
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:24,780
Yeah.

267
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,740
So it's much the same sort of thing, except on a much smaller scale.

268
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:37,060
And it turned out that David Cake's wife, Karen, who I don't think I've met on this trip, but I don't think I've met before, spent a year working.

269
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,980
She's an emergency doctor by trade and she spent a year in Alice Springs working for the flying doctor service.

270
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:51,060
And this is the closest I've got to anyone who lives in the interior of Australia at all who is actually also an active fan.

271
00:15:51,060 --> 00:16:00,760
If you are listening to this podcast and you live in the interior of Australia and you're an active fan, then please get in touch because I would very much like to talk about what it's like to live in the desert.

272
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,100
Yeah, that's good.

273
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,900
Sounds like you're having a good time on your guff trip.

274
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,980
I'm exhausted.

275
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,900
So tired.

276
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:26,660
Liz has posted a link in our show notes with a tweet that expresses some concerns about the ConZealand programme and an open letter to ConZealand outlining and detailing those concerns.

277
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,280
Liz, would you like to talk a little bit about what's going on here?

278
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,900
Yes, I mean, I just happened to see this tweet retweeted on my feed today with a link to the open letter.

279
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:46,520
The discussion seems to be about essentially Hugo finalists and the use of Hugo finalists on the ConZealand programme.

280
00:16:47,080 --> 00:17:03,240
And it sounds like quite a lot of Hugo finalists have not really been offered things that are relevant to their expertise or they feel their panels do not have a diverse enough participants or a diverse enough framing of the topic of the panel.

281
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:13,280
And also, it's not clear as to whether people can participate in programming without a full membership extension where they have to buy the full membership.

282
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,340
And of course, this is all especially difficult because this is the first virtual world con.

283
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,560
And so there are going to be extra difficulties and problems associated with that.

284
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:31,580
But it sounds like coming this letter, although not public, are some suggestions for ways in which these problems could be mitigated.

285
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:38,900
Yes. And the tweeted question was posted by Alistair Stewart, who is a nominee for, sorry, who is a finalist for Best Fan Writer.

286
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:46,220
And people may know him as well for being a host on the Escape Pod family of podcasts.

287
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,580
My thoughts on this are...

288
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,960
Good job, Mark, protecting there, John. Protecting the Hugo finalist, Mark.

289
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah. Well, you know...

290
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,720
You can cut that bit, sorry.

291
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,200
I just got...

292
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,820
Because I was like, Alistair's not called Mark.

293
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:09,800
Which is like, Mark Plummer has done a number on my ability to accurately talk around my role on the Mark Protection Committee.

294
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,120
So, the...

295
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,700
I have thoughts about this.

296
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,640
I am a Hugo finalist, as has been previously mentioned.

297
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,820
I am not on the ConZealand programme because I am not attending ConZealand.

298
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,940
I did get a programme participant survey, I think.

299
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,040
But I didn't fill it in because I'm not going.

300
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,060
I, in general, can see the point that the signatories of the letter are making.

301
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:46,540
But I think my thoughts on this are neatly encapsulated by something that listener Emily January said to me and Liz in another place and another time.

302
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,600
Which is that I understand that I understand that representation is very important.

303
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,840
So, the Worldcon to feel like they're being invited in if they get nominated for Hugos.

304
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,520
And I can see why having Hugo finalists on the programme is really important.

305
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,880
But, however, I think that there is also an argument that the Worldcon is by and for the Worldcon membership.

306
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:19,240
And so, if someone is not a member of the Worldcon, it is not necessarily the case that they should be invited to be on the programme if they haven't signed up.

307
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:31,020
So, I think there is, in some ways, a clash here between Worldcon as a thing that is put on by its members and the expectation that you will be invited even if you are not a member.

308
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,840
And I think that is a complex discussion that kind of runs up a little bit about the Worldcon style of having members instead of tickets.

309
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:52,140
And I wonder whether conventions that are more ticket-based might be skewing this conversation slightly in a way that is a little bit antithetical to how Worldcons have traditionally worked.

310
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:59,120
And I do think that there is another element here, which Emily pointed out,

311
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,140
which is that she has chatted to newer convention attendees at Easter Cons,

312
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,480
who she has said, oh, you'd be great on programme.

313
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,540
And they've said, I can't be on programme, I'm not an author.

314
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:16,580
And I think this idea that to be on programme, you need to be a professional or need to be recognised in some way is dangerous,

315
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,420
because I think, in general, programming is about putting interesting people on panels.

316
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:31,040
But having said all of that, obviously, people who get nominated for Hugos and become Hugo finalists are perhaps interesting people who it would be good to have on panels.

317
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,760
So maybe those aren't antithetical concepts.

318
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,780
So my thoughts on this are all very wishy-washy and nuanced, which is unhelpful for polemic.

319
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,980
Alison, be forthright.

320
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,460
I agree with everything that John said.

321
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,620
So I think some of the wishy-washy stuff there is fine.

322
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:57,740
I also note that people are kind of like, I got offered programme, but it wasn't the exact programme item I wanted to do,

323
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,780
to which I would say that's a thing you can suck up.

324
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:07,100
But I also note that they say the programme is not diverse enough and it doesn't feature,

325
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:16,100
it doesn't have enough diversity in its range and scope, and it doesn't have enough diversity of participants.

326
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,860
And that, I think, Con Zealand, if it had got its act together four or five weeks earlier,

327
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,000
would have done well to have a think about.

328
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,440
It's now clearly too late for them to do that.

329
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,060
Some of the Australian and New Zealand fans I have spoken to have said,

330
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,940
you need to remember as well, this is a New Zealand Worldcon,

331
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,280
and they are, and I think 100% correctly,

332
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:44,260
foregrounding Australian and New Zealand creators and fans in the programme.

333
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,640
And that is absolutely the right thing for them to be doing.

334
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,860
Part of what you do when you have a local Worldcon is showcase what you are doing,

335
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,240
both professionally and fancially in science fiction, for the world.

336
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,000
And I think that's inevitably going to lead to some voices,

337
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,760
particularly voices from American participants,

338
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,960
not getting as much attention as they often do.

339
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,160
I have no idea where Alice Stewart comes from.

340
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,300
He's British.

341
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,060
I should say the spreadsheet is a private suggestion of spreadsheets,

342
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,580
which I think is correct, is the correct way to do it.

343
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,820
There's an open letter,

344
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,800
and then they have privately sent a set of helpful suggestions to the programme team,

345
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,620
which I think is absolutely the right way to do it.

346
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,820
Well, it's a good way of doing it,

347
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,160
because it doesn't turn it into a giant mudslinging flight,

348
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,280
but it also implements concrete suggestions.

349
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,040
I think there's a few aspects of this.

350
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,080
One is, I think it is normal, or at least it's been normal when I've been involved,

351
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,740
to get in touch with all the Hugo finalists who you know are attending to say,

352
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,720
hi, would you like to do some programme?

353
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,420
But part of this is about the Hugo finalists who are not attending,

354
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,400
who do not have a comped membership.

355
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,740
But part of the issue is that usually,

356
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,860
because the expense of attending a Worldcon is way more than just the membership,

357
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,280
it ends up being that even if you gave free memberships to every Hugo,

358
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,960
every Hugo finalist, many of them still wouldn't be able to attend.

359
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,320
I feel like if they comped membership for every Hugo finalist who was not already an attending membership,

360
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,820
they would have a much bigger problem on their hands than the problems that they currently find themselves.

361
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,920
Because all the Hugo finalists who had maybe, at some considerable expense themselves,

362
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
because it's not cheap, joined the convention.

363
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:41,380
This is another argument for why you should be Eurocon and charge 10 euros for your membership.

364
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,000
I still haven't joined yet, but I must do this.

365
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,720
Or UK Games Expo and charge absolutely nothing.

366
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,960
I mean, I have had discussions about whether we should just be giving comped Worldcon memberships

367
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,880
to all Hugo finalists, like, as a matter of policy,

368
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,320
and, you know, refunding the ones who already had memberships.

369
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,980
But it does, in any normal Worldcon, end up being quite a lot of your members.

370
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,460
There are quite a lot of Hugo finalists as well.

371
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,840
And they're, in fact, increasing numbers of Hugo finalists,

372
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:14,420
because we have a lot of multi-editor podcasts and magazines, which is great.

373
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,380
But it does just increase those numbers again.

374
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,360
So I think we worked out that you'd have to comp, like, a substantial fraction of the membership,

375
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,980
which would be an issue.

376
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:28,040
But with this being a virtual Worldcon, that issue is partly sidestepped,

377
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,880
because you don't have a membership cap.

378
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,960
You don't have the physical facilities.

379
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,680
Your costs are not as high.

380
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,100
So in this case, I think they could consider comping every Hugo finalist.

381
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,100
So my thought on this is effectively something that Alison knows I have strong feelings on,

382
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:49,440
which is I generally think this problem is being caused by the fact that the membership is far, far too expensive.

383
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,940
And the fact that we have seen, like, zero other science fiction conventions charge in excess of about $30,

384
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,620
and this one costs somewhere in the region of five times that, is tricky.

385
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,060
And I sympathize for the ConZealand Committee, and there must be reasons they're doing that.

386
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,400
And I suspect those reasons are things they can't easily get out of.

387
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:20,060
But honestly, I think the whole thing is being caused by the fact that this is a hell of a value proposition for a virtual convention.

388
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,620
And I think it's difficult, because you're quite right that in general,

389
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:31,900
comping Hugo finalist memberships would not enable them to attend the convention anyway,

390
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,300
so there's not much point in doing it.

391
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:38,680
But this year, it would be necessary to do that for most of them to attend.

392
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,160
And also, it's the one year that doing it would mean they could participate.

393
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,720
So it changes the conversation a lot compared to normal Worldcons

394
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,740
and other virtual conventions running alongside the Worldcon.

395
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,380
I have two thoughts.

396
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,700
The first is that one of the things that has been a little less nice about my guff trip

397
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,360
has actually been a bit sad,

398
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,460
is that I keep having conversations with people where I say,

399
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,980
and are you going to ConZealand?

400
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,500
And people are saying,

401
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,320
no, it's far too expensive.

402
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,480
I can't do it.

403
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,180
And I've kind of got used to those conversations in Britain.

404
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:20,860
But I have been quite sad and surprised by the extent to which I'm having them in Australia.

405
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,000
And I think that's...

406
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,600
It's really interesting, because I had assumed the reason I was talking to a lot of British people

407
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,540
who weren't going was because those people were not planning to go anyway.

408
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,620
But if people from Australia and New Zealand are not planning to go,

409
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,300
that says something quite significant, I think, about ConZealand's pricing structure,

410
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,620
because I would have expected anyone who had been planning to go to the Worldcon

411
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,660
to have been attending the virtual Worldcon.

412
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,100
The people who already had attending memberships have kept them.

413
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,000
They did.

414
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,380
Their kind of partial refund system has worked in terms of keeping their attending members for the most part.

415
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,360
I don't think a lot of people who had attending memberships have scrapped them.

416
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,600
But people who were hoping to go or have not picked up the virtual membership,

417
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,880
just the same way that they haven't in the UK as well.

418
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,840
So I thought that was a bit sad.

419
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,140
My second point was, having said that they clearly cannot routinely comp membership

420
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,460
for every Hugo finalist, because that enormous number of Hugo finalists,

421
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,940
I think they might manage to comp membership for every Hugo finalist

422
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,440
who is not already an attending member and is from a marginalised group

423
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,540
and suggests that they may have financial problems managing the cost of membership.

424
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,840
Because I don't suppose that's actually going to be that many people.

425
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,240
So that would have been a thing that they could do.

426
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,280
And certainly, I don't know if this is true of Worldcons,

427
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,940
but in the UK, we have an honourable tradition of having an unwaged membership level,

428
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,580
which is available to you if you feel you need it,

429
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:57,520
rather than making it sort of a thing where you have to be able to prove that you need it,

430
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,980
which I think is in general a good model for doing that sort of thing.

431
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,760
It's not a lot cheaper, but it is something.

432
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,040
You could have the same system here where you say,

433
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,880
look, if you are from a marginalised background and, you know,

434
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,200
you would like a comp membership, we're not going to ask questions.

435
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,980
You know, we're not going to ask you to prove anything about it.

436
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,540
We just will.

437
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,520
So my other thought is that having only very briefly looked at the Conzealum programme,

438
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,540
because I'm not going, it's got a lot of programme items,

439
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,180
but I think it's still got quite a lot fewer than at a regular Worldcom,

440
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,460
which I think makes sense.

441
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,180
I don't think you want like 15 to 20 programme items running simultaneously.

442
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,120
I think you probably want five to 10,

443
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,680
but it means there are many fewer spots on the programme.

444
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,740
And I also wonder if they're having an issue of time zones,

445
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,500
because one of the things that has become increasingly difficult

446
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,180
when programming Worldcoms is trying to do the scheduling.

447
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:52,840
It is like a, you know, multi-week nightmarish jigsaw puzzle.

448
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,300
And that is with everyone in the same time zone,

449
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,440
to try and get everyone on items with the right people

450
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,600
and to find a time when all those people are available at the Con.

451
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,980
And, you know, there will always be commitments people have.

452
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,760
There will be people who don't like doing late evening panels,

453
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,500
people who don't like doing morning panels and so on.

454
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,020
And sometimes you do go, okay,

455
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,540
this would be the ideal set of people for this panel,

456
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,440
but there is no time slot that actually works.

457
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,500
And so I have to change it up.

458
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,260
And I wonder if time zones are causing even more of a problem,

459
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,280
because if your ideal panel would have someone who's in Europe,

460
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,120
someone who's in New Zealand and someone who's in the USA,

461
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,480
that's going to be very difficult to do.

462
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,900
So I wonder if sometimes the way that they have solved

463
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,720
problematic scheduling issues is to drop people

464
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,020
who would otherwise be good on the panels

465
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,560
and replace them with someone who just has more availability.

466
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,480
I think I'm sure that the time zone scheduling

467
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,720
has been an absolute nightmare.

468
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,420
And they can't, you know,

469
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,920
I basically told them I would be on Australia and New Zealand time,

470
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,140
but I've been given at least one panel on European time.

471
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,460
And luckily it's at 10 o'clock at night,

472
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,480
New Zealand time,

473
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,940
because I'm kind of a late bird,

474
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,220
will probably be okay.

475
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,600
But it's quite a serious panel.

476
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,760
And normally at a British convention,

477
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,100
I go on panels at 10 o'clock at night

478
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,660
and they're all the kind of lighter hearted ones.

479
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,980
So I don't know whether,

480
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,500
how it's going to work in practice.

481
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,580
One other thing I wanted to point out.

482
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,460
So I was complaining about the cost of Con Zealand

483
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,560
relative to other online conventions.

484
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,020
And we mentioned that the Eurocon this year is 10 euros.

485
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,940
I will say that there's the opposite,

486
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,320
the opposite problem occurs to me,

487
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,980
which is,

488
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,760
is this partly because we as a community

489
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,160
are not valuing our time as volunteers enough?

490
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,580
And we actually should be charging more than 10 euros

491
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,960
for what is probably really quite a lot of work.

492
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,500
Is this something where Con Zealand

493
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,440
are actually charging an appropriate amount of money

494
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,980
for what it is they're planning to put on?

495
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,460
And other conventions are so severely undervaluing

496
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,580
their offerings that Con Zealand

497
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,820
are suffering as a result.

498
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,860
But we always undervalue our volunteer labour

499
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,920
because we essentially put thousands of hours

500
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,240
of volunteer labour in for no money.

501
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,780
all the actual costs that you pay for Worldcon

502
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,980
is going to the physical facilities

503
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,060
and the paid staff of the venue.

504
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,820
It's not going to anyone organising it.

505
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,240
So it would be a completely different model

506
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,980
if you started charging for virtual conventions

507
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,000
because of the volunteer time you're putting into them.

508
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,940
I can understand charging in order to make sure

509
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,060
you have, you know,

510
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,280
a sufficiently good Zoom and Discord licence and so on.

511
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,460
But if we're going to actually start saying,

512
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,140
OK, and then we will somehow compensate people

513
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,600
for the volunteer labour you've put in,

514
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,900
then you are, one, changing the whole model

515
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,560
and two, you're probably going to get yourself

516
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,820
into a very sticky situation

517
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,660
because you're then employing people.

518
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,620
That's a good point.

519
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,320
I'm not sure if that was what you were proposing.

520
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,480
Not as such.

521
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,320
I guess I wasn't trying to argue

522
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,340
that they should pay volunteers as if they're employees,

523
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,100
but I do wonder to what extent

524
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,660
Con Zealand are using more services

525
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,320
which do this sort of thing professionally

526
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,660
because they partnered with the Fantasy.network

527
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,320
and people like that.

528
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,060
And I do wonder whether part of this disconnect

529
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,020
is coming from,

530
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,160
this is an appropriate amount of money

531
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,360
to spend for this sort of event,

532
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,540
but most other places are much more relying

533
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,240
on volunteer labour to make it work.

534
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,460
OK, so we always rely on volunteer labour

535
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,420
to make things work.

536
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,760
I think Con Zealand decided,

537
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,440
possibly correctly,

538
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,440
possibly not so correctly,

539
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,560
that they didn't have the skills within fandom

540
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
to do everything that they wanted to do

541
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,120
and so would need to use paid labour

542
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,780
for something that would normally be volunteer labour.

543
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,080
But in fact, their primary things are,

544
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,580
you know,

545
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,620
we're going to send you an email

546
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,760
with your Zoom links in it.

547
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,000
We're going to be on Discord.

548
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,540
I mean, this doesn't seem to be that much different

549
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,760
from what Balticon did

550
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,300
and Balticon managed with its existing volunteer knowledge.

551
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,060
You know, we've built up some knowledge

552
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,500
in this area in the last few months.

553
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,520
I mean, I don't want to criticise Con Zealand

554
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,220
too strongly for a decision that they took under pressure.

555
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,740
I feel like they're doing their best job they can

556
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,260
to run a good convention

557
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,420
under extremely difficult circumstances.

558
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,320
But I feel like,

559
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,260
considering that we are all volunteers

560
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,300
and we are generally happy to,

561
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,060
you know, we muddle along

562
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,480
in slightly good, less good hotels than we might

563
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,460
and slightly less good circumstances

564
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,140
than we might generally at conventions

565
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,840
because we're actually after the volunteer feeling of it

566
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,580
and the relatively cheap thing.

567
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,680
I think that the models that we see going forward

568
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,020
will be cheaper than Con Zealand.

569
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,780
They may not be as cheap as Eurocon.

570
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,060
We'll have to see how that goes.

571
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,640
A lot of the professional conferences

572
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,800
I might consider going to have gone online

573
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,040
and their virtual registration rates

574
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,220
are usually somewhere between

575
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,820
sort of maybe 20 to 60 pounds.

576
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,440
So they are a cut above Eurocon,

577
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,420
but they're not as much as Con Zealand.

578
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,260
And so this actually neatly dovetails

579
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,660
into the next point I was going to make,

580
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,200
which is, is the other mistake,

581
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,460
potentially, that Con Zealand has made

582
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,440
not relying on sponsorships?

583
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,560
Because, like, the UK Games Expo

584
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,860
is doing everything for free,

585
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,920
but they're being sponsored

586
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,480
by some of the largest companies in the industry

587
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,280
and a large part of the money

588
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,160
they'll be spending to make their convention go

589
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,860
is being provided by those companies.

590
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,020
Now, Worldcons have not traditionally

591
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,940
relied on sponsorships

592
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,300
and there are contentious discussions

593
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,460
to have about that.

594
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,340
And I have been present

595
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,200
for some of those discussions,

596
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,500
even though I am a baby fan.

597
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,780
Worldcon has an interesting sponsorship history,

598
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,800
which I think we should take another time.

599
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,280
But it is fair to say

600
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,940
that in general, but not always,

601
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,700
Worldcons have happily taken

602
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,560
some money from publishers

603
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,340
and Eastercons, for that matter.

604
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,900
But it's not normally,

605
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,140
there's not normally the amount of money

606
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,700
flushing around in the industry.

607
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,340
that there can be

608
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,380
if we were taking money

609
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,560
from television or movie studios, say.

610
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,900
So publishing is more marginal generally.

611
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,340
However, I remember having a chat

612
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,780
with Patrick Nielsen Hayden of Tor

613
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:03,100
where the Toronto Worldcon

614
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,300
was called TorCon,

615
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,000
TorCon 2 or TorCon 3.

616
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,880
And Tor Books basically went,

617
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,140
yeah, no, we'll spot,

618
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,120
I see you have this range

619
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,240
of possible sponsorships,

620
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
sponsorship things.

621
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,360
Can we have the biggest one, please?

622
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,800
Which I think is quite cute.

623
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,340
They weren't called TorCon because of that.

624
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,600
But in general, there are issues,

625
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,300
there are some sponsoring issues.

626
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,220
We are not very good at acquiring sponsorship

627
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,360
and then finding appropriate ways to use it

628
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,340
that don't worry our membership.

629
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,420
I think another good example of recent sponsorship is

630
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,400
San Jose's, sorry,

631
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,900
Worldcon 76,

632
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,920
San Jose 2018.

633
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,980
They had their Hugo ceremony

634
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,280
and it was sponsored by Google

635
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,780
and they gave a free Google Home

636
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,260
to all of the Hugo reception attendees that year.

637
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,860
And because Google does not have an obvious conflict of interest

638
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,180
with any of the kind of Hugo finalists,

639
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,380
that went entirely unremarked upon

640
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,260
and I think was generally a very good idea.

641
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,140
So maybe that's the other thing,

642
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,360
which is science fiction fandom in theory

643
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,360
leans towards friendliness to technology

644
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,240
and to other such things.

645
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,420
So perhaps going to a technology sector

646
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,460
which is increasingly flush

647
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,480
or maybe even going to somewhere like Weta,

648
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,660
who are obviously a homegrown New Zealand institution

649
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,560
but aren't necessarily explicitly competing

650
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,160
for any of the Hugo categories.

651
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,940
There might have been options,

652
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,020
but it's very easy to quarterback these decisions

653
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,340
when you're not the one making them

654
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,320
under incredible pressure.

655
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,880
And I do think Alison's point about that is valid.

656
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,040
I realised that one of the other things I do

657
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,580
is the MIT puzzle hunt

658
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:45,080
and the MIT puzzle hunt is entirely paid for, really,

659
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,340
by sponsorship from tech companies.

660
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,020
And when these tech companies talk about

661
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,900
why they sponsor the MIT puzzle hunt,

662
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,880
it's like there is no better place to recruit in the world

663
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,620
than by the sort of people who like spending three days

664
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,620
of their weekend solving very hard puzzles for fun.

665
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,040
Is it too soon to say

666
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,220
Eastercon needs to think about going virtual?

667
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,100
We're back to normal by Christmas, Alison,

668
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,700
don't you remember?

669
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,640
And we'll play football against the Germans on Christmas Day.

670
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,880
I've just been struck dumb by that thought.

671
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,600
That's so good.

672
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,840
Sorry to anyone who does come to us for escapism

673
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,000
for the sudden and unprovoked mention of Boris Johnson,

674
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,460
for which we can only apologise.

675
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,400
Oh, I thought this was like off the record

676
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,240
for planning for the next podcast, so.

677
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,820
I'm not cutting that joke out of the podcast, Liz.

678
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,840
No, I think that bit about,

679
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,440
no, we're going to be playing football with the Germans

680
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,120
on Christmas Day, I thought was amazing.

681
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,540
We're going to turn the virus off for an hour

682
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,180
so we can all go out and play football.

683
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,160
Yes, fantastic.

684
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,800
But in fact, I don't know if I'm the only person,

685
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,760
but I felt a real chill in my heart when Johnson said,

686
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,620
we will have normality by Christmas,

687
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,900
because I just went, oh, well, we're not going to then.

688
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:11,460
Clearly, clearly that's his way of saying this will be the 2020 to 2024 pandemic.

689
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,380
I've done some reading.

690
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:23,480
I don't think we've got time to go through it in quite the detail of our previous episode,

691
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,580
in which we talked about Hugos.

692
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,440
I've read the Hugo finalists for best novel,

693
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,080
with the exception of The Light Brigade,

694
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,900
which is the last one on my list.

695
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,960
I haven't quite got to it yet,

696
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,960
and I'm about two thirds of the way through Gideon the Ninth,

697
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,540
and I have read the other four.

698
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,500
I've been enjoying them, generally.

699
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,300
I thought they were very high quality,

700
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,100
and I would be happy to see pretty much any of them win.

701
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,380
So far, my favourite is Memory Called Empire.

702
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,520
I was on a Zoom yesterday with some friends,

703
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,360
in which I was decrying Gideon the Ninth,

704
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,800
but it turns out it gets good about 40% of the way through,

705
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,600
and now it has got good.

706
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,680
I am really enjoying it.

707
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,420
I will say that the beginning is a little bit of a slog,

708
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,640
and my wife keeps asking me whether it has gotten good yet,

709
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,540
and I keep saying, no, be patient.

710
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,360
It gets there.

711
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,320
I know that a lot of people think that's going to win.

712
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,980
I don't know if it will.

713
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,800
I think my favourite is, as I said, Memory Called Empire.

714
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,460
I have read City in the Middle of the Night and Middlegame.

715
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,020
So I think City in the Middle of the Night is probably my least favourite.

716
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,940
I liked it, but it didn't quite do what Charlie Jane Anders' previous novel did for me.

717
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,440
Quite like Middlegame.

718
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,360
Really liked Memory Called Empire and The Ten Thousand Doors of January,

719
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,040
both of which I thoroughly enjoyed and thought were really, really good.

720
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,060
And as I say, Gideon the Ninth, I think I like it better than Middlegame and City in the Middle of the Night,

721
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,580
but I don't think I like it quite as much as The Ten Thousand Doors of January or A Merry Called Empire.

722
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,580
I'm wondering whether I'm going to enjoy The Light Brigade because my wife bounced very hard off it.

723
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,920
But I will be reading that and hopefully next episode I will have some thoughts.

724
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,720
But yeah, so far, those are my thoughts about best novel.

725
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,000
And I just want to very quickly outline them to show that I do read.

726
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,680
Yay!

727
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,180
Even when I'm not on trains.

728
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,160
That's probably a little bit longer than three minutes,

729
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,840
but that's mostly because I got a DC Fontana episode mixed up with a Charlie Jane Anders book.

730
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,380
I thought you were going to do all the Hugo categories.

731
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,240
And I was like, shit, John, I need dinner at some point.

732
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,560
I have read some of the Hugo stuff, but nothing like enough.

733
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,960
One of the...

734
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:36,600
I accidentally found myself in a discussion of best novella at one of the Zoom chats I've been in at Critical Mass.

735
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:42,480
And they found it quite interesting because they said, we all like this one the best, but we don't think it will win.

736
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,800
We think this one will win.

737
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,980
And I thought that's very interesting.

738
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:54,560
They kind of had this notion that the Hugo voters are voting as a conglomerated mass that do not vote for the best thing.

739
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,520
But whenever I voted in the Hugos and be really, really keen to see something amazing win,

740
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,740
it's either won or come second to something else very solid.

741
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,500
So I'm not sure I agree with them.

742
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:13,100
But I have stored their prediction away and I will be watching the Hugos carefully.

743
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,020
Reveal it in an envelope after the Hugos.

744
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,160
Next episode.

745
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,980
And I'm giving out a Hugo.

746
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,300
I'm so excited.

747
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,980
I had forgotten that that was a thing they make guff delegates do.

748
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,880
How do you give out a Hugo on Zoom?

749
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,780
No, it's great.

750
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,800
When I gave a Hugo to Claire, it was brilliant, even if I did pronounce the name wrong.

751
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,800
I am very excited about handing out a Hugo, even though it's obviously going to be a virtual thing.

752
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,700
Which category are you handing out?

753
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,540
I am handing out best fan artist.

754
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,480
Oh, excellent.

755
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,080
That's really, yes, excellent.

756
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:56,300
I did get round to listening to episodes of at least one, but mostly two or three episodes of all six of the best fan cast Hugo finalists.

757
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,600
And I wrote an article about it, which is reasonably complimentary about all of them.

758
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,420
I think it's a it's an overview article at Glasgow 2024 blog.

759
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,220
And I was quite interested in them.

760
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,060
I wanted to say a little bit about it.

761
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:23,780
I wanted to say a little bit here about them because it turns out that most of these fan casts are people talking about books or movies or television shows.

762
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,920
And sometimes that can be very interesting.

763
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,500
But generally, while it is all very well, it is not my primary interest in science fiction fandom.

764
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,180
I realized what I was listening to these.

765
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:45,900
So hence I noticed that Lillian and Christina and Ian are out there doing a fan cast about everything else in the world now.

766
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,700
So maybe we can encourage other people to do theirs, too.

767
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,900
So we could have a whole network of people do fan casts that aren't just talking about the books they've been reading.

768
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,280
So this never happens is the name of an excellent Spanish podcast done by Lillian Edwards and Christina Lake.

769
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,640
And they made me sad because they reminded me that my Duolingo streak had gone away.

770
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:14,040
I had a multi hundred day Duolingo streak and it went away over Christmas because I was very busy and I forgot to do it two days in a row.

771
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,600
And yes, it went away.

772
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,140
Very sad.

773
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:24,920
But I now know the Spanish preterite tense because I have been learning my Spanish with an app called Anki.

774
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,020
So A-N-K-I, which Liz recommended to me.

775
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,140
And it's very good for learning languages and whatnot and other things.

776
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,380
You could do full LaTeX markup.

777
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,760
I use Anki for many.

778
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,220
I mean, I don't actually.

779
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:44,480
But when I am trying to learn things, I set up Anki deck for the things that I'm trying to learn.

780
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:53,420
So, for example, I have an Anki deck where I just the Anki deck shows me the name of a dance that our Morris side does.

781
00:43:53,420 --> 00:44:07,300
And I play the tune for it on my Melodian so that I can remember how all the tunes start so that we don't have that embarrassing thing where the dancers are standing around going, OK, musician, please play the 18th of May.

782
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,940
And I go, you can't see on the video, on the audio.

783
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,860
But that is a very embarrassing thing for musicians to be doing.

784
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,380
That is not uncommon for musicians.

785
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:22,480
What we'll do is we'll take a photo of Alison looking confused and we'll put it in the show notes now.

786
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,280
So, like, look at your podcast app.

787
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,820
Look at it now.

788
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,260
Now.

789
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:25,960
It's gone away now.

790
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,720
Look at my fully functional LaTeX using Anki deck there.

791
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,320
Whoa.

792
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,700
You're going to have to take a screenshot of that and send it to me, please.

793
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,360
Oh, is that LaTeX Thai?

794
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,840
Well, no, it's LaTeX for transliterated Thai because this is from back before I could read.

795
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,400
But the transliterations require me, or the method my school uses, requires more than just a standard alphabet.

796
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,880
So, it's got a U with a line through it, which represents the U vowel.

797
00:44:51,880 --> 00:45:00,000
OK, so when you said LaTeX, I was like, oh, I guess you could use that for learning how to write maths.

798
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,780
But I learned how to write maths by just writing the LaTeX when I needed it and looking up things to find out the next bit of LaTeX I needed for the next bit of math.

799
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:15,040
It had not occurred to me that anyone used LaTeX for anything other than maths.

800
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,100
I use it for work, obviously.

801
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,140
Well, that's maths, isn't it?

802
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,680
I'm Dr. The Boy Hugo finalist Coxson.

803
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,540
Yeah, but you use long words like magnetosphere.

804
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,180
And magnetohydrodynamics.

805
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:33,560
But Drago's kicking and screaming back to the topic, which is interesting that I think Alison has reached, I don't know,

806
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,700
maybe there's like a first level of fandom where you actually spend lots of time talking about the books and the television and the movies,

807
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,580
which maybe were the start of your fandom.

808
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:44,620
And then at some point you move on to this higher level Alison has reached,

809
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,560
where you're now sort of meta fandom because you're sort of wanting fan cast that talk about fandom.

810
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:59,100
Oh, I think one of the fan castes, sometimes the fan castes get into the material business of science fiction.

811
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,800
So what it is that we are doing when we do science fiction.

812
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,800
And I find that a lot more interesting.

813
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,740
And all of the fan castes do this sometime.

814
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,700
It's not that some of them do it.

815
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:20,200
But so a fan cast will go almost seamlessly from in this book, there are a boy and a girl and one of them turns out to be the hero in disguise.

816
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,640
And the book tells of their adventures through the planet.

817
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,540
No, I'm paraphrasing, but not as much as you might want.

818
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,880
And then they'll suddenly go into.

819
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:37,380
And it's very interesting the way that this book compares with the same sorts of themes being talked about 20 or 30 years ago.

820
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,580
And at that point I'm riveted and I can't quite find a way to get.

821
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:53,720
Please stop talking about the plots of the books or why you find them exciting and start talking about what it is that is what it is that is going on critically.

822
00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:03,160
So for people in board game fandom, this reminds me a great deal of the difference between the Dice Tower reviews and the Shut Up and Sit Down reviews on YouTube.

823
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:10,060
Because the Dice Tower does great reviews in which he goes through the rules and explains what he likes and dislikes about them, which I find very dull.

824
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:18,620
And Shut Up and Sit Down talk about games and how they make you feel and how they compare to other games that might have made you feel similar things or different things and what the differences are.

825
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:23,420
And the latter is fascinating and something I thoroughly enjoy listening to in both science fiction and board games.

826
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,380
And the former is not something I'm as interested in.

827
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:32,400
I think of it as a difference between a book report and a book review in a way.

828
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,040
And that they are aiming to do different things and giving me a different interpretation.

829
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:46,800
I think part of the reason I like panel discussions at conventions so much is because you tend to get that kind of wide ranging discussion of themes and juxtapositions.

830
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:58,060
And it helps you contextualise your reading and the reading you've done with reading you haven't done and draws parallels and helps you explore the genre.

831
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:04,400
Whereas a book report talks a lot about a book, which is valuable, but I don't find that as compelling.

832
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,180
I think that's fair.

833
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:05,960
I hope that's fair.

834
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:18,420
I want to also mention when you're talking about gaming podcasts, I like I like tabletop, which is a video, a YouTube series rather than which is the Wil Wheaton thing, because they just play game in an entertaining fashion.

835
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,540
So I assume they play games for hours and then edit it so you only actually see the good bits.

836
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:37,880
But I feel like I end up with a sense both of how these people are enjoying themselves, which is always quite engaging, but also whether this game is worth playing or not, which is something that I'm quite keen to get out of gaming podcasts.

837
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:57,780
Next time we record this podcast, we are inviting all of you to join us for episode 11 of the Odd Thought Podcast that will be being recorded on the 2nd of August at 12 noon British time.

838
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,940
That's British summertime.

839
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,720
And we will be putting a link to that on Facebook.

840
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,340
And if you're Claire and Mark, we will be emailing you a link because we know you're not on Facebook.

841
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:14,920
And if there's anyone else who's not on Facebook, get in touch and we will email you the link as well.

842
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:21,080
It is not just Claire and Mark, but we don't want to put the link just openly on the internet because you know how it is.

843
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:28,540
So if you'd like to come send us, send an email to the email in the show notes or find the event in our Facebook group.

844
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:39,580
And I would expect that after we finish doing the proper recording part of the podcast, there will be a trivial chat part of the podcast because those seem to work quite well as well.

845
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,500
And you'd be very welcome to stay around for that.

846
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,380
Or in fact, come to that without coming to the live podcast.

847
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,480
That would be fine.

848
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,420
Yeah, we can't tell you when it starts.

849
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,460
It will start sometime between 45 minutes and three hours.

850
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,000
Too true.

851
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,760
Too true.

852
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,540
Okay.

853
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,860
So that was the 10th episode of the Octothorpe podcast.

854
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,120
And it's goodbye from me.

855
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,400
And it's goodbye from me.

856
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,940
It's good day from me.

857
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,160
I'm in Australia.

858
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:11,220
The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin MacLeod at incompetech.com.

860
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:27,680
And I'm like, well, there will be written, you know, there is some written stuff.

861
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,620
And I have, I've written up a couple of anecdotes about the trip.

862
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:36,900
Like when I got off my Zoom chat today at 11.29, 11.29 UK time.

863
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,900
I won't say where it was in the place I was.

864
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:44,400
My daughter said to me, did you really have another chat to go to at 11.30?

865
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,580
And I said, no, having forgotten that we were recording Octothorpe.

866
00:50:48,580 --> 00:51:00,100
But prior to that, she said, because it's really interesting because you said, oh, I need to let you go because you have a, you've told me that you've got a draft to submit to before Worldcon and you have a load of work to do.

867
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:07,620
And you said, oh, I really should be spending, I only get a couple of hours to spend with my family before I fall asleep.

868
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,180
Those are the couple of hours I'm currently spending recording the podcast.

869
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,700
But let's, let's move that away.

870
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:28,660
And you said, oh, and she, she just reeled off the many increasingly fretful excuses I'd use to try and get this lovely, but, but ever continuing person off the Zoom chat without success before going, no, gotta go.

871
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,280
11.30.

872
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,820
Is this by any chance not for the podcast?

873
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:41,680
I feel like, I feel like it's probably okay because I don't think the person in question is going to realize this was them.

874
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,120
And if they did do, then we're very sorry.

875
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,360
But I'm just going to say, it's one of these British things.

876
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:56,240
If a British person says, I need to let you get on or I'm taking up too much of your time, it means we're done now.

877
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,880
Can we, can we stop this call?

878
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,600
Or if you say briskly, right, that, that means goodbye.

879
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,320
Like, and it would be very useful if everyone was aware.

880
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,680
No, I.

881
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:13,660
No, but sometimes right means I'm thinking of leaving and I'm going to look like I'm leaving, but actually I'm going to stay and chat for another half an hour and maybe have one more beer and then go.

882
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,640
Yeah, no, I mean, I think I use the word right an enormous amount.

883
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,100
Right just generally means I've actually had a thought and I'm not going to tell you.

884
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:24,600
So the, the, I have, I have become very good on Zooms.

885
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,680
Just putting in the chat, I have to go now, bye.

886
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,340
And they're disconnecting, which I view as the Zoom equivalent of an Irish goodbye.

887
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,380
And I find very useful.

888
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,120
But yes.

889
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,500
An Irish goodbye?

890
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,360
Irish goodbye, where you leave a party without saying goodbye.

891
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,440
That's an Irish goodbye, right?

892
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,420
I think so, yeah.

893
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,360
You just leave because, you know, it would take you half an hour to go and say goodbye to everyone.

894
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,240
You just got to duck out.

895
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,800
We shall put a link in the show notes.

896
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:55,720
I believe, I learned a couple of years ago that there is great merit in not saying goodbye to people, but just leave.

897
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,920
And I think that's probably even more true on Zoom.

898
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,820
I mostly do that at conventions with a few honourable exceptions.

899
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:05,160
I usually say goodbye to Liz because she's from far away these days.

900
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,440
So anyway, other questions about the guff trip?

901
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:07,660
Yes.

902
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,840
Now, you're going to be camping in Wales while on your guff trip.

903
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,700
How does that work?

904
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:17,880
We decided that while we have this window where it's possible for us to see our elderly relatives, we should do that.

905
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,500
And so we're going to be camping close to my in-laws.

906
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:26,120
So you're going to go camping with your relatives while on your guff trip?

907
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,080
No, no, no.

908
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,120
We're camping near to where my relatives live, but do not have enough house space.

909
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,540
Ah, okay.

910
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:30,960
Fair enough.

911
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,020
I mean, that's not that exciting.

912
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,560
So I think what I'm going to do is get up at dawn.

913
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,880
There is a problem.

914
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,700
There's not a lot of time after that and before Worldcon starts.

915
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,360
I think the start of Worldcon might be very hard for me.

916
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,580
So my current plan is to rise at first light, which is about four, and go to sleep.

917
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,760
Or maybe slightly before.

918
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,800
I am determined to see this bleeping comet.

919
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,860
Just look.

920
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,980
Which I'm kind of like, I'm up in the middle of the night.

921
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,220
I ought to be able to see a comet.

922
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,600
But my house and garden and location have other ideas.

923
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,900
I'm going to need to move a little bit away from Walthamstone.

924
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:13,060
I managed to see it by just going to our local park, which is not particularly unlight polluted.

925
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:18,320
But I imagine that Southampton's light pollution is less than London's in general.

926
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,300
No, I mean, I think Simon Bisson had no problem in Putney.

927
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,740
But anyway, North Wales should be no problem.

928
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,540
Oh yeah, you'll be fine.

929
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,900
I mean, it's next week rather than this week, but I don't think it's going anywhere.

930
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,120
I know that comets are slightly...

931
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,320
They do move, obviously.

932
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,560
I mean, Professor the Boycoxman must know all about comets, right?

933
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,600
Yeah, the big balls of ice and stuff.

934
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,460
Yeah, no, that bit I do know.

935
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,980
So yes, comet Neowise is visible.

936
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,440
Closest approach to Earth is on the 23rd of July, which is in four days time as we record.

937
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,040
Probably the day or the day after we release this episode, if you're listening to it.

938
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,760
So yeah, you should be able to get good views then.

939
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,940
But I was able to see it with the naked eye night before last.

940
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,780
And I managed to take a very good photo on my phone.

941
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,920
So I was very happy.

942
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,280
And I'm hoping that I will be able to use my phone to take an adequate photo.

943
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,240
Just before dawn in North Wales.

944
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:10,960
You'll be fine.

945
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,160
You've got the same camera as me.

946
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,660
I have a brand new phone.

947
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,640
I mean, it's an old phone, but it's...

948
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,140
No, you don't have the same camera as me.

949
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,480
You've got the one before mine.

950
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,660
But you should still be fine.

951
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,740
I've got the new iPhone SE.

952
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:26,040
It should be perfectly up for taking photographs of Comet.

953
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:30,580
Yes, just take a tripod or something because a 30 second exposure will do you wonders.

954
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,340
Oh, yeah.

955
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,440
No, I'll just probably push it on a beanbag.

956
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,080
That works.

957
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:40,300
I put it on one of those tree scaffolds you get for very young trees and that worked fine.

958
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,200
I mean, I'll sit it on something.

959
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,220
So no, I am determined to see it.

960
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,720
But otherwise, I'm planning to just get up at first light or just before first light to take pictures of Comet.

961
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,240
And then go to bed mid-evening and not enjoy my evenings.

962
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,040
But you know what?

963
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:57,680
I mean, we're staying in the field of Pete Crump and his wife Carolyn.

964
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,160
Carolyn Thompson, not Crump.

965
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:07,940
And the whole thing about sitting in a garden enjoying a beer with somebody is a lot more fun before it gets dark.

966
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,380
This is an activity that stops being fun at nightfall.

967
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:19,020
So I think if I just kind of stay awake from sunrise to sunset, it will be reasonably OK for Australia and New Zealand.

968
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:27,140
I'm not doing the bits of the trip where you'd be travelling or hanging out in people's houses doing your laundry.

969
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:32,020
Did Liz want to ask me any questions about guff, seeing as I love nothing more than talking about myself?

970
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,120
That bit is really not for the podcast.

971
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,880
Oh, that's going in.

972
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,060
That's 100% going in.

973
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,440
That might be the episode title.

974
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:48,200
No, I think I'm curious to talk to you in another two weeks when you will presumably be almost completely dead.

975
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,380
Oh, yes, we should plug the live episode.

976
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,280
The live episode.

977
00:56:52,280 --> 00:57:01,300
Yeah, we need to talk about a live episode coming from Liz's house where you're going to send me some backdrop photos that I can use as my virtual backdrop.

978
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,140
Yeah, well.

979
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,380
Of the interior of your house.

980
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,860
I'm going to have to tidy my house.

981
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,840
It's not very exciting, though.

982
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,860
I mean, it's just a house.

983
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,260
I could probably steal some photos off the internet.

984
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,680
OK, so what would be even better might be a coffee.

985
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,660
Can you go out for coffee with people at the moment?

986
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,140
Yeah.

987
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,880
So I could, like, have a photo from a coffee shop in Thailand.

988
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:29,420
Liz, you need to send me and Alison virtual backgrounds so that we can all be in the same place when we do our live recording.

989
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,220
All right.

990
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:30,580
OK.

991
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,680
OK.

992
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,340
Is that the view from your house?

993
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,760
Yeah, a number of...

994
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,980
This is the view from the train station.

995
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,180
Sorry.

996
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:42,260
For those of you who cannot see, which is everyone because this is a podcast.

997
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,160
I've been changing my virtual backgrounds to different places in Thailand.

998
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,560
And this one happens to be a nice sunset from the train station near my house.

999
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,900
Liz is going to send me these images.

1000
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,460
And if you look at your podcast app now, you will see them.

1001
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,240
Stop looking.

1002
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,900
They're gone.

1003
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,680
I never see the photos in podcasts.

1004
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,320
I know that they're there.

1005
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,240
Most people don't.

1006
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,340
So that's why it's funny.

1007
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,700
It's quite funny.

1008
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,180
I mean, I'm just like, how could I see them?

1009
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:11,200
I'm not watching your audio show.

1010
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:11,800
You're right.

1011
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,480
We should cut all that because it's for...

1012
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,080
It's like meta podcasting, which we will cover in the live show anyway.

1013
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,100
Oh, no.

1014
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:21,160
I will cut it down to just my joke, which was on point.

1015
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,360
Fine.

1016
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,580
You're channeling Ian Sorensen there.

1017
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,400
That's what you're doing.

1018
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,940
I do not mind.

1019
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,640
That is a great compliment.

1020
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,220
That is also staying in the podcast.

1021
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,620
Ian, you're a champ.
