00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,840
Jonny Baddeley said Octothorpe in 2026: We'll go somewhere where there's cheese.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,280
I mean Allison's house, I think, is somewhere where there's cheese.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,600
Yeah, I I have had no cheese free days in twenty twenty six.

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:33,040
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 152nd episode of Octothorpe.

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:41,880
a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is slowly coming to the realization that it is in the computer.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,840
On the 29th of January 2026, I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,480
I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,840
And we have

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,940
As is traditional, some letters of comment.

10
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,940
We got some letters about our discussion of Rene Walling.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,920
Uh we've got a couple of Facebook comments um which I will uh read out.

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,479
So

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:17,860
Kev McVeigh wrote to us and said, the conversations you had about zero tolerance reflected discussions that they've had at their organization.

14
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:26,140
um where they wanted to define what they meant by zero tolerance and that it allowed context to be considered.

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,920
So they're looking at wording that states no incident will be ignored or dismissed and anyone affected will be fully supported.

16
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,640
And I think that is something that makes a lot of sense.

17
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,600
I think we we touched on this in the episode

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,160
I think having some nuance in in these processes is good and lets you achieve better outcomes.

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,800
So thank you very much for highlighting that, Kev.

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,400
Alison makes a valid point about rehabilitation, but

21
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:04,460
You know, if you're rehabiliting someone, you'd expect some sort of probation monitoring, and that last bit is what Montreal could be cleared on, like what supervision and support will Walling receive.

22
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:15,460
and what channels are there for anyone if if there is a problem, and that's something we uh highlighted last episode, kind of you'd expect the safety mechanisms to be in place.

23
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:24,340
And Ivan Sinner wrote in and said as a long-term trade union rep, he has a lot of experience in the protection of victims of harassment, but also the rehabilitation and re-education of those who are harassed.

24
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:33,500
To me the key question is what happened in the intervening time after the band did this person come back doing low-level volunteering and prove himself or has he just waited?

25
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,240
Um we said in the last episode we didn't know.

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,680
Um we've heard since um that Rene has been part of

27
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:51,240
So it was brought to my attention that René was part of the France in 2023 WorldCom Bid Committee, which then became the Nice in 2023 Bid Committee.

28
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:59,340
uh and was also one of the people on the CANSMOF committee who um gave scholarships out to SmofCon 32 and 33

29
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:07,079
was also involved in running the online Smofcon during the pandemic and was involved um in the Aurora Awards um last year.

30
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,720
So he has been doing various things.

31
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,799
Farah Mendelssohn

32
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,379
wrote in saying that Rennie Walling has never left fandom.

33
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,220
He's been at conventions that Farah has attended and has done much backroom work.

34
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,820
And there have been no subsequent complaints, so that's good to know.

35
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,780
Farah does say that we claimed he had not done work.

36
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,220
I don't think we did claim that.

37
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,900
I think we were very clear that we didn't know.

38
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:35,660
Farah was also part of the team that was asked to revisit and write the new code of conduct in the Redacon aftermath.

39
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,940
And we also heard from Ali Baker on Blue Sky.

40
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,780
Ali basically says like

41
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:49,099
The statement from the chair explaining what Rennie Walling has done to learn from the ban and make amends would go a long way, and coming back as a department head is interesting, why not a regular volunteer?

42
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:49,819
I think

43
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,459
I think as far as says he has been volunteering in sort of lower capacities over the last kind of decade.

44
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,660
But I do think that a lot of this is because Montreal have not said anything about it.

45
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:10,180
And if they had made a lot of this clear in advance and made their safety procedures clear in advance and had maybe a statement from Rene Walling and a statement from the chairs.

46
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,860
a lot of this would be much more obvious to everyone.

47
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,620
And and I think that is the core point.

48
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,459
I think they do still need to do that.

49
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,739
Um but I am glad that people wrote in and gave us more information.

50
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,260
Thank you everyone who did.

51
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:31,220
Yeah, I think it's it's good to have all that information and I think we got a lot of interesting stuff and I think we were less saying that Renee shouldn't be working on the com.

52
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,300
And in fact I don't think we got anyone

53
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,820
who didn't think he should be working on the con.

54
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,900
It was just lots of people saying, look, there are maybe ways that you can make this work and ways that this is not gonna work.

55
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,500
And we're really discussing how Montreal as an organization should be doing this.

56
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,139
But it is it is tricky because it is obviously a very personal thing.

57
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,460
Yeah, I think we talked about this a lot last time.

58
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,180
I'm not

59
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,880
Let's just see how it goes.

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,240
Good luck Montreal.

61
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,680
But Montreal not gonna send us any more interesting emails though.

62
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,580
Montreal, please send us as many interesting emails as you like.

63
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,300
Uh we also heard from Henry Balin, um, who uh

64
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:19,760
wrote in about the Montreal old chart as well, uh, saying that it it looks like there's a lot of free spots in the program in program for various area heads, which you would normally have.

65
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,240
And also you do tend to start

66
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,540
pretty early with this.

67
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:31,140
I think I agree with Henry that there's a lot of gaps, but I also think there's a lot of like logistical stuff program needs to do early.

68
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,700
that isn't actually necessarily coming up with program items.

69
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,300
It's getting people to write in and give you their details and collect their details if you

70
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,900
uh you know need to try and find out who's coming and wants to be on program and so on.

71
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,180
And actually you can do a lot of that without the people who are actually going to come up with the program items.

72
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,940
Uh but you do need someone to collect that data as Henry very well knows.

73
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:00,500
On the subject of the all chart, I'm not sure we've talked about the division heads in much detail uh at this point, and we probably won't this episode.

74
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,100
Um but just so people know

75
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,160
They have got some division heads and it's not just deputy division heads and area heads.

76
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,560
So you've got Angela Jones Fiat in communications, Carolina

77
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:20,500
Gomez Lagaloff in Convention Services, Kate Wood in events, Diane Lacey in exhibits, Sean McCoy in facilities, Alexia Hebel in finance

78
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:29,380
Joni Brill Dashoff and Caitlin Cunningham in Member Services, Carl Fink in program, Carl Zbang Zwanzig in Tech, and Todd Dashoff for Wusfus.

79
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,940
And some of those names will be more familiar than others.

80
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,900
So Carolina was the chair of Smofcon, the one that's just happened.

81
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,300
So we've kind of mentioned her name recently.

82
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,259
And Diane Lacey, you might remember her name from being the whistleblower from Chengdu

83
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,060
Um and you might remember you might also recognize some of the other names, listeners, but those are the two I think we've mentioned on the pod.

84
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,340
So yeah, and we might come back to discussing some of these people in future.

85
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,060
We might not.

86
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,260
We reserve the right to be flexible and dynamic.

87
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,080
Um we also heard from Chris Garcia, which is not that common for us, but we have done this time.

88
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,440
He suggests that if I haven't remembered

89
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:11,860
um about lions in Kenya, it's because I have developed a very specific a form of amnesia that only affects it.

90
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,940
Uh and I can confirm that it actually affects all sorts of things.

91
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:20,900
Yeah, that.

92
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,900
He's looking at Montreal to look at restaurants to to make trips to.

93
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,580
I mean ro Montreal

94
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:40,340
One of the many few things I remember about the last time I was in Montreal, which was for 2009 Worldcon, is that its restaurants are fantastic and the food is fantastic and I very much envy everyone who's going there and eating excellent food.

95
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:48,900
Um, he will definitely be going to Worldcon, so hope um in I assume that's LA Con rather than

96
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,500
Montreal, but he doesn't say.

97
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,259
I'm sure he'll be going to both really.

98
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,300
It's not very far for him for for LA Con.

99
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,060
Um he talked a little bit about um

100
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,620
Don't s not saying it's complicated.

101
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:09,540
And he says that when he's done training, um, the issue or when he's been t delivering training, the issue is that you lose both ways.

102
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,020
If you s if you say things are complicated

103
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,120
then you worry people.

104
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,520
And if you d say things aren't that complicated really, then if people find them complicated they feel daft.

105
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,480
So the best idea maybe just to not say anything about the complexity or otherwise

106
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:32,659
That's why my very specific method is to say this can seem complicated, but we will go through it together, because then if you find it comp

107
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:43,960
Ah, so if I'm teaching if I'm teaching Titan the fantasy slugathon game in an hour or two, I should say this can seem complicated, but we'll go through it together.

108
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,880
Then everyone who thinks it

109
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,260
Looks complicated.

110
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:54,220
You're like, I understand you validate their feeling of confusion, but you tell them that they will eventually not have a feeling of confusion.

111
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,180
And then they believe in you to take them on that journey.

112
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,640
And they they and and in only about twelve hours they will agree it's the best game ever.

113
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,520
Right.

114
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,960
Yay

115
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,300
And that's foreshadowing for Alison's pick.

116
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:13,220
He he admired my name drop from the last episode, so if you didn't spot it, go back and see it.

117
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,580
I don't name drop things very often, um I think, but there's there was one there.

118
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,720
He really wants to say the word cyclocross as cyclicros, a mental sport played by X-Men.

119
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,839
I'd watch.

120
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
I have recently been reading.

121
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,940
the uh Age of Judgment.

122
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,220
No, what's it called?

123
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,300
Axe, Day of Judgment.

124
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,540
There was a big Marvel crossover that Kieran Gillen was involved in where basically a big man uses his thumb a lot.

125
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,760
And that has mmm psychic mutants in it and Gene Grey is scary.

126
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,960
That is all I have to report.

127
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,560
Is this one of those classic John Classic

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,319
John uh plot summaries.

129
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,120
Yes.

130
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,800
Classic John plot summary.

131
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,079
I will I will f I think that it is a reasonable explanation that there is a big man and he does things with his thumb.

132
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,980
That is accurate.

133
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,780
Mm-hmm.

134
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,780
While while we are on the subject of Chris's letter, I just wanted to say

135
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:20,120
Especially for Rosanna Pendlebury, who wrote to us on Blue Sky to say that she had been earwormed.

136
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,640
I'd like to say, Rosanna, where can you see lions only in Kenya?

137
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,640
Come to Kenya, we've got lions.

138
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,400
Right, that should do you for another fortnight.

139
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Uh and then we'll see you back next time.

140
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,000
Indeed.

141
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,800
Fair.

142
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,040
You're a bad person, Liz.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,640
Maybe

144
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,460
We heard from some people on Mastodon.

145
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,300
So Raj wrote in saying this is from an episode a few uh weeks ago, basically

146
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:52,820
That he was glad I picked Your Wishes My Command, because it's great.

147
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,860
Correct.

148
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:01,220
Uh and also, having just listened to the final Starship Alexandria Advent episode, have you ever thought about releasing a bloopers reel?

149
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,420
I find the thought of Libs

150
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
Liz corpsing oddly hilarious.

151
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:16,000
Now, I'm gonna say that any prospective uh blooper reel would basically just be us being vaguely tachi with each other and would not be as funny as you think it is in your head, Raj, unfortunately.

152
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,280
All of the actual funny bits go in the podcast.

153
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,520
That's what I was gonna say.

154
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,600
The funny bits stay in, the bits where we're going, Oh god John it's ten fifteen, are you not out of bed yet?

155
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,520
Do not go in the podcast.

156
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:35,540
You know, hypothetically speaking of uh you know something which has obviously never occurred on the pod.

157
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:44,180
And uh Doug McGregor wrote in to say, apparently Glasgow had a vibrant food culture almost six hundred years ago, and uh

158
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:53,780
And someone else wrote saying, I reckon there was a Gleswegian expat in Rome in the late fourteen forties banging on about Haggis Pakora and complaining that he got sunburned every time it was taps afe.

159
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,300
He recommends a coffee shop in Cambridge called Barbarella

160
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:09,720
He does not know if the propriety was a math mo, but believes that Mathos predates my time as an undergraduate by several years, also following a pattern of abbreviating slang, which

161
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,519
goes back to at least Duncan's grandmother's time.

162
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:23,320
I I think I'm always very careful when people say, Oh, this has been going long much longer than you think because often when you actually go and look for the citations you discover that no it hasn't and you have kind of

163
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:27,420
you retroactively believe that you've been using words for longer than you have.

164
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,860
Um, but I don't know.

165
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:31,819
We heard from Scott Edelman.

166
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,699
I'm very sorry if it's not pronounced Edelman, Scott.

167
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,019
Please write in and let me know if I did that right.

168
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:44,860
But they said that they ran errands listening to us and for some strange reason they suddenly needed prodigious amounts of brie.

169
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,780
Luckily he had some in the fridge, so his lunch plans are now settled.

170
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,360
Excellent.

171
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:58,800
And Farah wrote in on Facebook to say that they once did also do what I did, but they at the time it was a fiver rather than twenty because of inflation.

172
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,839
But I'm glad to know I am not alone.

173
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,000
We got a few letters about Cyclocross.

174
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:13,199
Ed Morland points out that the larger contribution to board games is clearly one of the marks of cycling's superiority over cricket as a sport.

175
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:13,579
Discuss.

176
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,060
I I just think that the good cricket board game hasn't yet been made.

177
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,380
I mean I think there's a there's an opportunity there.

178
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,100
Yes.

179
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,620
Because I think there's some okay ones, but I don't think and there's a classic much loved um

180
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,000
small dice game, um, that's been played for very for a very long time.

181
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,800
That you can play.

182
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:41,160
Though the reason it's so successful is that you can you can make it you could carve up pencils to play it and then and then play it in class while nobody is looking because what you've got looks like pencils.

183
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,720
But

184
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
That's its only claim to fame really.

185
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,680
Um I think there's a scope there.

186
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,279
If you're a board game designer, design a really good cricket board game, off you go.

187
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:49,839
Yes.

188
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,839
It's also it's also tricky because I do have a good cricket game in my collection.

189
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,660
So there.

190
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,500
Yeah no you'd be telling me to b I can't remember which one it is.

191
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,220
It is called Overs.

192
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,079
Overs.

193
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,120
Yeah, no I.

194
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:17,120
But I also, on Instagram, regularly get advertised multiple different cricket board games, and I have not bought any of them on account of how I don't know if they're any good, but I have been tempted.

195
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,240
I think the problem is, so cricket has been there have been attempts to make cricket into a board game many, many, many times.

196
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:30,240
Um, because if you type cricket into board game geek, there is a bewildering number of games, including like one game that goes back to 1930.

197
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:39,779
But yeah, I take the point, I don't think there's been a classic of the genre um that has uh that has been made around cricket, whereas Flam Rouge is is a classic.

198
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,399
So yeah.

199
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,759
But also I've played Umriefenbreiter and that is terrible.

200
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,319
So it is also not the case that all award winning cycling based board games are good.

201
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,800
And I don't think it was just my grasp of German.

202
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,000
I think it is a bad game.

203
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,079
Uh Ed also recommends

204
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,720
Ed also recommends Leader One Hell of the North.

205
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,360
Uh which doesn't sound like it, but is in fact a cycling-based game.

206
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,000
Excellent.

207
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,120
It sounds like a Game of Thrones game

208
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
themed around how stark.

209
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:15,760
Neil Harrison, friend of the pod, was asking if there were any good running games and I saw a good looking running game prototype at uh

210
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,440
the Northeast Tabletop Expo that's being worked on by a couple of locals.

211
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,800
Um so I always yeah I do I think there's scope there too.

212
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:30,320
Mike Scott wrote in to say that Cyclocross is like cross country horse riding events except for bicycles, not horses.

213
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,480
And I mean I guess you could say it's quite like cross country skiing, except with bicycles not skis, right?

214
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,240
Or or any such thing.

215
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,280
But it's probably more similar to cross-country horse riding, because there's also no snow.

216
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,880
I guess.

217
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,800
You can do cyclocross in the snow.

218
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,280
Do you need snow for cross-country skiing?

219
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,040
Can you do cycle crossing the c snow?

220
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,440
These are good these are good informations to have.

221
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,240
Thank you.

222
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,480
I I assume that bicycles are less trouble than horses on average.

223
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,160
I mean I don't really assume that, because Mike used to own horses and I own a bicycle.

224
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,400
I am I actually know that bicycles are a lot less trouble than horses.

225
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:13,540
My bicycle certainly was a lot less expensive than a horse, but I don't know about Sacrocross bicycles, which may well be the opposite.

226
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,500
Oh, they might be very problematic and and

227
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,720
text you, but do they bite you?

228
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,720
What I will say, I mean firstly I have been bitten by a a bicycle.

229
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,680
Good to know.

230
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,240
By which I mean I've had my skin caught in a way that has made it nip very badly and that was unpleasant.

231
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,440
But secondly, horses are much, much less likely to get a puncture and need a new inner.

232
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
I think I think you shoot them when that happens.

233
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:44,900
Sheila La said that the o the podcast cheered her up after she had her shingles vaccine, which seems reasonable.

234
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,820
Get your vaccines, people.

235
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,220
And um she says you also mentioned Hugo Girl.

236
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,060
Please can I request a crossover with them on one of their Happy Hour episodes.

237
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,700
We've been planning to do a crossover with Hugo Girl for a long time, but it hasn't quite happened.

238
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,500
Yeah, we had Lorion.

239
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,180
We did have Lorion, yeah.

240
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:07,660
Uh the the think the problem with the a crossover with Hugo Girl is our perennial issue of time zones.

241
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,780
I don't think there's a time zone in which that civilized in Atlanta

242
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,400
the UK and Bangkok.

243
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,920
No, probably not.

244
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:24,760
Uh we also heard Ron Payne who uh said they love our commitment to pointing out audio issues no one else would have noticed if he hadn't pointed them out.

245
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Well, I noticed when I was listening back, so thank you very much, Ron.

246
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,080
But uh I think it was terrible and normal service is now resumed.

247
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,039
Yay!

248
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,100
No hum, no hum, no hum.

249
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:38,460
That was letters of comment.

250
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:40,220
Thank you everyone for writing in.

251
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,980
Ooh, that was a lot of letters of comment.

252
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,640
So Reconnect, which was the 2025 Eastercon, has put out their financial statement

253
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,520
Which is very good because they've managed to get the financial statement out before it's even the next Easter.

254
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,320
And that is really good because it's very helpful information and it's good to be able to have a discussion of these things.

255
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,200
I think

256
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,120
relatively soon after they happen.

257
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:19,679
It's it's great that we had the catch-up of all the Eastercon accounts as uh spearheaded a few years ago by uh Claire Briley.

258
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,720
Let's nice to see that we are actually kind of keeping on track with that.

259
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,279
So

260
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,020
What is in the meat of the account?

261
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,380
The meat.

262
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,900
Basically, this was the Eastercon in Belfast.

263
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,180
And so they knew it was going to be a bit of a challenge because it's got some unique circumstances.

264
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,620
It's the first time Easter Con had gone to Northern Ireland.

265
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:48,200
Um, they didn't really know how many locals they would have and their site was sort of split across a conference center and a hotel rather than being in one hotel.

266
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,480
And so they basically have a lot of information on what they did to try and approach the possible challenges, which I think is quite interesting.

267
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,880
One of the things was to keep membership rates

268
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:04,600
low and to try and use past convention membership numbers to guess how many they were likely to get.

269
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,320
They were quite creative with the space they had.

270
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,420
And there was some last minute room availability which helped them shift things around.

271
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:19,780
I think if you were there, they were those smaller program rooms that were kind of on the first mezzanine floor in the Hilton, which was nice, but some of those were pretty squishy

272
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,039
You could fit quite a few people in, but they're a little bit cramped.

273
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
And they said that the city centre location was vital.

274
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
I think that is true because

275
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:36,840
As we've said before, it was a super location with a bunch of hotels in walking distance and lots of things to do and lots of places to eat, uh as well as making it quite easy.

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,520
Once you got to Belfast, it wasn't that difficult to get from

277
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,400
wherever you were arriving to the con.

278
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,039
It's not one where it's kind of miles out of the way.

279
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,720
And also that they had some great support and funding from Belfast City Council and Visit Belfast.

280
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,760
So that's really interesting.

281
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,280
They do say they got to

282
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:02,140
Uh the member total membership number being nine hundred and ninety-nine, which just just make one person up, Tommy.

283
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,860
Uh

284
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,280
Uh this is not financial advice.

285
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:12,520
So fun fun fact, Tommy reported in the committee WhatsApp that we'd hit a thousand members and then someone had the heartbreaking task.

286
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,760
of pointing out that he'd double counted one member and being the one that made it nine hundred and ninety nine.

287
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,160
So you you think it's you think it's disappointing that we only got to nine ninety nine?

288
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,080
Imagine the disappointment when we uh had to downgrade it from the even thou.

289
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,840
But you know, you gotta you gotta report accurate numbers.

290
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,840
You can't just make people up, Liz.

291
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
Yeah, I'm sure they'll have forgotten one somewhere.

292
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:37,760
Give a give an honorary membership to some

293
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,700
Dead Irish fan from the past or or a soft toy or something.

294
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,620
Someone bring their Beeblebear.

295
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:44,860
Yeah.

296
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,140
Beeblebear.

297
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,180
Uh yes.

298
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,100
So if we go to the uh financial report

299
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,680
Um there's a there's a couple of things where like the numbers in the spreadsheet don't quite match what is in the text.

300
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,400
There is uh a discrepancy between

301
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:09,380
The surplus number reported and the surplus in the spreadsheet, uh, but we chatted with Tommy, and that is because it does not account for ten thousand pounds they have passed along to future Eastercons.

302
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,220
I think they've also

303
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:19,500
Got a sort of phantom number of income from program unless the program at the con actually made money, which seems unlikely.

304
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:26,440
So, but it looks like they ended up making a surplus of roughly £20,000, which is pretty good.

305
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,600
But what I would say is

306
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:42,960
that of their income of about hundred and seventy thousand pounds, forty thousand pounds of that was pass along from previous Eastercons, and thirty thousand of that was uh a subvention from the Belfast Tourist Board.

307
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,520
Essentially it has ended up using a net of 20k from the passalong.

308
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,160
Yeah, yes.

309
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,080
I'm not I'm not sure that it's f reasonable to say, oh, we've made a healthy surplus

310
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,380
when we've not when we've spent all of our when we've spent substantially m more pass along than that surplus.

311
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,180
Yes.

312
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,740
So

313
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:06,860
Essentially they the forty thousand pounds was passed in and they ended up with a surplus of twenty thousand.

314
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,340
So there's essentially twenty thousand pounds there that's come from previous Eastercoms.

315
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:22,980
And they have a note about this that essentially they feel maybe we need a bit more transparency about Eastercon funds and what is still available and has been unspent from previous ones that can be used for things like Pass Long.

316
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:34,740
Now, my position here is that if we have a sum of Passalong, then something like making sure an Eastercon in Belfast can be tried.

317
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,760
And we avoid the possibility of financial ruin.

318
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,520
I think that's actually a good thing to spend some of our passalong on.

319
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,320
100%.

320
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,200
And I'm quite happy that that's how it went.

321
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,400
But I think

322
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:56,500
This is the sort of thing where you do need to make sure that everyone who's involved with Eastercoms and finances knows what is available and what is going on.

323
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:05,460
Because obviously you can only do that once in a while and will have eaten up all the surplus of the past Eastercons and won't be able to do that for a while.

324
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,380
And I think it is good that you can have that room.

325
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,460
Like you can take in forty K and then say, oh actually we've got twenty K to give back.

326
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,180
That's great.

327
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,700
That gives you that buffer zone if your membership numbers, you know, end up a bit softer at the end or whatever.

328
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:28,720
But I think it probably needs not formalisation, but I mean Eastercons are very much like each one is separate and we make it work by community discussion.

329
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,039
Mhm.

330
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,320
I don't know how to square the circle of

331
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,560
We don't want to be a big formal organization, but we probably do need to think a bit more about our collective funds.

332
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,640
Part of this is the process of the in-person bidding session where people ask questions like this and they're answered.

333
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:51,220
Um, so you can hold uh Eastercon to account by what they sent two years ago, but you probably won't.

334
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:58,660
I think it is interesting that they took forty thousand pounds in Parcelong, have taken have had only twenty thousand left.

335
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,039
and have I think s only passed along ten thousand of that twenty.

336
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,559
The other ten thousand is being held to run a convention in Northern Ireland.

337
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,160
I don't think that's necessarily a a wrong thing to do, but I'm not sh I think if I was

338
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,680
running the twenty six or twenty seven Easter con I might feel a little bit hard done by on that.

339
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,520
It's true, but we also don't know what discussions have gone on with the twenty-seven and uh twenty-eight.

340
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,320
Easter con sorry, twelve well, twenty six, twenty seven, twenty eight.

341
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,320
Twenty six and twenty seven, I think, yeah.

342
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:32,840
Uh they might be quite happy with their financial situation and said, Yeah, we don't need that pass along.

343
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,240
But

344
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,720
Again, that's this is how it all works, is we do this in a fairly informal ad hoc basis.

345
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,799
I think it's good that people are paying attention.

346
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,320
When people started pointing out the errors in this to Tommy, he was like, oh

347
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,900
That means that people are actually reading this.

348
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,580
I wasn't sure anyone r was reading it.

349
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,980
And I think the the group of people who read it might be quite small, but I think they're fairly thorough.

350
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,060
There was a spreadsheet, of course I read it.

351
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,780
There's no formal peer review process for Eastercon accounts, right?

352
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,220
So the peer review is you put it out on the internet and everyone reads it and picks holes in it if they find them.

353
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,980
There's no way of generating a report that doesn't have some errors that need finding.

354
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,980
So the sooner you get the report out, the sooner people can discuss it and and have those discussions.

355
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,140
So I think it is important to

356
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:25,480
you know, recognize that as a good thing even while then having the questions around the details.

357
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:34,940
I think it is very clear to me that spending money from the collective Eastergong Pars along and the legacy of of Glasgow 2024

358
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:45,360
To put an Easter con in Northern Ireland, that is a good use of our money and that expands the franchise and is just a great thing and has also set up

359
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
It has enabled non-con.

360
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:55,360
So there is a wider um benefit to spending that money that has that is then generating more later.

361
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,919
And that is a wise way to invest.

362
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,039
So even if

363
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:06,620
I think it was clear to me from the outset that I wanted this to happen even if it meant we had to spend some money like overall.

364
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,820
But I also think like it sounds like it hasn't

365
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:17,880
been I think there was a world in which it could have cost us much more to do this and I think Belfast went very well and I think that is also a good thing.

366
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,380
I believe we call this open post-publication uh peer review now, John.

367
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,900
Yes, that is what we call it, which is code for uh we don't have any reviewers.

368
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,440
As the as the non-academic of the three of us, I'm like, oh.

369
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,840
That would be inside baseball again, right?

370
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:43,520
Tommy also says that uh the final number included 135 new to Eastercon members they attracted.

371
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,280
Now we don't know how many of those came because they had

372
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,800
a slightly lower rate than other recent cons.

373
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:57,000
We can't do that counterfactual, but that is a good and healthy number for, you know, starting something going in Northern Ireland.

374
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,880
Some of those will be people who came in Saturday on the five pound cosplay.

375
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:09,139
um membership which I was skeptical about on this platform but seems to have been quite a big success.

376
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,860
Yeah.

377
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,720
Went really well, had lots of cosplayers in, everyone liked that because people like there being cosplayers at their conventions.

378
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,880
No, I mean having Ghostbusters wandering around, that's just cool.

379
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,419
That was fun.

380
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:29,299
And I think like, you know, again, brings people into our sort of convention and then they tell their friends and then we build that that momentum and stuff.

381
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,299
So just to play

382
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,800
Devil's Advocate a minute.

383
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
She's drinking devil's advocacy.

384
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,280
Oh, avocado's horrible, John.

385
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,880
Absolutely disgusting, yeah.

386
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,160
If I had to drink that to be devil's advocate, then I'd probably do it less.

387
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:51,400
The thing I might say is if I were another Easter cotton which had had to set higher rates in order to make my budget balance

388
00:27:52,019 --> 00:28:01,380
Then I might have some more to say about the fact that Belfast basically deliberately set them low to bring more people in, and we don't know what effect that had.

389
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,640
We don't know if charging people ten pounds more for a membership on average would mean that we got many fewer.

390
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
And it could be that that would have been enough to balance the budget.

391
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,880
So it is it is tricky.

392
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,600
I'm not well versed in like the science of

393
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,300
where you start to put people off on the membership curve.

394
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:26,620
But yeah, if I was trying to budget Eastercons and going, Oh, this is not viable unless we charge people a lot more, then you know it now we're thinking, oh but actually

395
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,600
How do I persuade people to uh give me some of their surplus money?

396
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,720
That is fair.

397
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:41,480
Alright, looking at the membership rates for the upcoming East Cons, Birmingham later this year is currently an attending membership of £90, and Glasgow next year is currently an attending membership of the £10.

398
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,280
membership of 105.

399
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,160
So I think it's interesting because I would say that 2026 Eastercon is doing the traditional

400
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,039
quite low membership rate that we've seen historically, Glasgow is clearly going a little bit higher than that.

401
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,639
But I don't actually remember what all the rates were at various times.

402
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,360
I might have to do some kind of collecting rates over time thing.

403
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,840
Yeah, no, if you're an Easter Con Treasurer, do write in.

404
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,039
Uh general, very well done, Tommy, for getting that out.

405
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,799
So in such good time.

406
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,880
It's good to have that information before the next

407
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,200
Easter cod.

408
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,880
It's well timed as well.

409
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,880
For a week we don't have much to discuss.

410
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,400
So thank you, Tommy.

411
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,440
Yes.

412
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,120
Shall we talk about the new Brisbane logo?

413
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,160
Alright, this is an all me episode, fans.

414
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,760
Whoops, all is

415
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:48,399
I would like to report that Brisbane in 2028 have a very nice new logo, which is basically designed to honor the Indigenous Peoples lands that the convention will be taking place on.

416
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:59,340
So the logo says Mianjin in 2028, which is the indigenous name of Brisbane, and they got a local indigenous artist and illustrator to draw it for them.

417
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,220
And it's very nice.

418
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,820
First off, I like the art.

419
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,140
But I think the second thing you say is I think this is a really nice thing to do as a bid

420
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:17,580
Because it's just one of those little things that one shows me that you are uh thinking about how you are going to bring in like the heritage of the place where you're holding the con.

421
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:26,520
So we get some nice art and we get to know a little bit more about the con and about the heritage of the place where you're holding it and about what you are gonna tell us about if we go there for the con.

422
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,040
And so that's why I think it is

423
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,200
kind of a neat thing to do.

424
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,160
And it's beautiful.

425
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,360
It is a beautiful image.

426
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,400
Lovely logo.

427
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,760
It is lovely.

428
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,400
The artist is um an Indigenous Australian.

429
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,740
Oh I should say the name of the art the artist is is is called Tori J.

430
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,300
Morty.

431
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:42,940
Should say that.

432
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,300
Yeah, no, it's just really good.

433
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,900
And I think honoring

434
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:54,660
It's interesting because I think it picks up on the cues from Edmonton to honor the indigenous peoples whose lands these conventions are being um held on.

435
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,920
I think that's really cool.

436
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,880
And it is beautiful.

437
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:05,520
Uh I thought one of the nicest parts of um Chicago welcomes um was in the Hugo ceremony, wasn't it, is that they they got some

438
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,160
uh local uh group to come and do like the land acknowledgement of the land on which it stands.

439
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,400
And I thought that was a really nice uh touch.

440
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,400
It was the Hugo ceremony, wasn't it?

441
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:14,600
Yeah.

442
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,639
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

443
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,399
I think we mentioned the time, I shall put a link in the show notes to it.

444
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,000
I think it might have been the opening ceremony and the Hugo ceremony.

445
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,000
I think they might have done it more than once.

446
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,180
But I might be misremembering.

447
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,620
It's quite possible they did.

448
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,340
Um but basically they did it at their big events.

449
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,060
Yep.

450
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:31,860
Indeed.

451
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,620
Tis nice.

452
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,120
Yeah, no, it is neat.

453
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,559
Neat's the wrong word.

454
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
It's it's it's good.

455
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,000
It's it's I think valuable work to do.

456
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:51,860
Uh we don't talk about news and current events very much on the podcast.

457
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:55,539
Um, but I just wanted to say that

458
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:07,460
One of the things that's happened since we last recorded is that Greg Greg Ketter, the owner of Dreamhaven Books, has managed to go viral for being um filmed during a protest um in Minneapolis.

459
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,940
And well, A, well done for

460
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:22,800
for being a v a virile, angry 70 year old on the internet, Greg, but also, oh goodness, our hearts go out to everyone in Minneapolis who's um dealing with the situation there at the moment.

461
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,880
Who includes a lot of fans and I'm sure quite a lot of people who listen to this podcast.

462
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,640
Well maybe two or three anyway.

463
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah.

464
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,720
Anything else?

465
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,400
Ah let's do some picks and be done.

466
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,320
That's a little short one and then I can get on with actually playing my pick.

467
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,640
Who would like to pick first?

468
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,720
Alright, should I pick first?

469
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,620
Oh yep.

470
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,260
I'm gonna pick a video game.

471
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,700
A video game?

472
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
It's Octothorpe Gaming Corner again.

473
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,580
Yes.

474
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,039
Uh I played the game Thank Goodness You're Here, which is it's kind of an adventure game.

475
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,480
Basically the the interesting thing about it is it is all set in a fictional Yorkshire town called Barnsworth

476
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:19,920
um somewhere in the past and the whole point of the game really you are a little you're a little yellow man and you have been sent to go and see the mayor of Barnesworth but he's busy so you end up trying to solve all the problems of the people in the town.

477
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,700
in order to eventually see the mayor.

478
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:30,260
And it is it is weird and surreal and entirely I have absolutely no idea.

479
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:38,240
um how this would work for anyone who did not grow up in England in the kind of, you know, seventies through nineties.

480
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:38,800
Um

481
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,059
I say adventure game.

482
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:51,260
You're you're a little yellow man, you have a button for jump and you have a button for slap things, basically, interact with things, and those are the only things you can do, and all puzzles can be solved by jumping and slapping things.

483
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,260
So there's really no like

484
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,420
the the difficulty level is very low and and it takes like a couple of hours.

485
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,300
It's just got this really weird sense of humour, which I like.

486
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,700
And it's not just that you're in this small town.

487
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:16,740
Like you're in this small town and then at the end y you know, you end up you your one of your puzzles is to help a man get his arm out of a grate, which you do by going to the chippy and like get a load of lard.

488
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:23,880
And then you have to find a man who is bedridden, but he wants to do his own shopping, so you have to help his arm get to the shops.

489
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,200
Relentlessly British.

490
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:35,919
Be that is a very good description, yes, says says one review, and it describes itself as a comedy slapformer.

491
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,200
Yeah, that's fair.

492
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,180
I yeah, I think it's worth playing.

493
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,940
It will take you an evening.

494
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:48,380
It's probably quite fun to watch because there's not a great deal of gameplay and you can now play it on all major platforms.

495
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,500
And you should give it a go.

496
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:56,860
The artwork will remind you of Whizer and Chips or Viz or art styles of that kind.

497
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,260
It is also relentlessly British.

498
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,480
And it it is quite clever.

499
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:10,320
So you're sort of in the town and you end up going looping round and round while you are solving puzzles and coming back to the same places and like things have changed slightly, like there's a

500
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,060
some neighbours arguing over their bins.

501
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,980
I said it was a very British game.

502
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,980
And they're always in a slightly different phase of the bin argument every time you are back.

503
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:26,600
This is um so this game is published by Panic, um, who also published Firewatch and untitled Goose Game.

504
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,600
It's not the same developer, but

505
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:38,819
It's weird because Panic is also like an old Mac software company that made my SSH client, so it's real weird that they've massively pivoted into video game publishing now.

506
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,520
But this has been on my radar as a result because I'm on their newsletter and I one day will play it.

507
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,520
I own it, I have no idea played it.

508
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,560
So one day.

509
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:57,580
Oh no, that in my understanding of blueprints is that that is an unrealistic Yeah, can it be f ever said to be finished is the thing

510
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,880
I am pretty sure there is a I have opened something that explicitly tells me that it will never end.

511
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,000
So, you know.

512
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,799
Hmm

513
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,779
Interesting.

514
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,059
Blueprints continues.

515
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,020
Shall I do a pick?

516
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,220
I want to play that game.

517
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:14,140
I I'm I'm I it's definitely one that looks like it could play well.

518
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,020
on our telescreen with us all sitting round having a laugh.

519
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,860
Yeah, 'cause also if you get stuck it'll just be someone shouting, Oh, uh

520
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,700
uh slap that fish more.

521
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,700
Have you tried have you tried shoving the thing up the what's it?

522
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,100
Yeah.

523
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,700
The thing is you can't even do that.

524
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,500
It's basically a have you tried slapping that thing

525
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,119
Have you tried jumping and slapping that thing?

526
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:38,640
And that's basically all the suggestions anyone can make to help you.

527
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,319
So you you can't take thing A and use it to slap thing B.

528
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,839
You can't pick things up.

529
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,400
No, you have no inventory, you have only snapping.

530
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,560
So my pick is going to be

531
00:36:52,340 --> 00:37:00,820
Miniature Worlds which is an exhibition in uh Newcastle upon Tyne at the Lang Art Gallery.

532
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,100
It's very good.

533
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:07,220
It is a collection of small-scale landscapes.

534
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,740
So it focuses on uh the work of Thomas Bewick, who was a

535
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:25,779
a wood engraver in Newcastle uh in the late seventeen hundreds and early eighteen hundreds, and basically did tiny, tiny illustrations for uh tail pieces for various books

536
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,760
It also has art by Beatrix Pochter and um JMW Turner among others.

537
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,200
And it's genre because it has sort of illustrations from genre works.

538
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,320
But it's also fascinating and very good.

539
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,040
But at the beginning of the exhibition there is a rack of magnifying glasses so you can deploy a magnifying glass to see the detail in some of the art.

540
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,840
and um and they are brilliant.

541
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:56,280
Um Alison would not like it because obviously all of the illustrations are taken out of their context and so she would just go around saying it should be in a book.

542
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,800
Uh but if you do not have Alison's problems with lack of context, it will be for you listeners.

543
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,960
Oh, oh I might

544
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,599
I cite every argument we've ever had about the Hugo Voter packet.

545
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:09,160
Oh.

546
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:17,800
And actually the exhibition does hang a lantern on, you know, these artworks would originally have been in books, but they are displayed as art.

547
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,260
Scandalous.

548
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,380
But no, it's really good.

549
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,580
I very much enjoyed it.

550
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,980
It costs 11 pounds and it runs until the 28th of February, which is a Saturday.

551
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:29,760
Yeah.

552
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:39,359
Um and I know because John has mentioned this elsewhere, that it includes some 3D panorama Victorian three D panoramas which were

553
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:48,500
amazing things where you've got a bought something that felt like a postcard but it kind of opens up concertinas shaped so that you can look all the way down a f an image of things.

554
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,340
This is something that people thought was very, very exciting before we had like

555
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,680
Television and things like that.

556
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,440
Keep you entertained for hours before you had, you know, blueprints and so on.

557
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,400
Don't know what I did with my life before I had blueprints.

558
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:12,700
I um I did I I had a chat with someone as we were going round the uh exhibition where we were marveling at the detail and he went, Well, I suppose there was no TV back then.

559
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,100
And I was like, Yep, fair.

560
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,420
Fiona Moore, if you're listening, write in.

561
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:26,700
There are still plenty of people working at fine detail, but I remember going to see a Ruskin exp exhibition a couple of years ago where

562
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:35,680
I the picture that they used for the image I'd assumed was a great wall thing and in fact it was a a watercolour illustration about that size.

563
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,760
and it was incredibly detailed and I don't know how people did that or do that.

564
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,240
I am told I cannot pick nostalgia.

565
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:43,800
No.

566
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
I think I must have picked nostalgia before

567
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,680
I am picking a game and the there's a slight problem with this, which is that I haven't actually played this game for about 35 years.

568
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,240
So

569
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:03,860
However, I am picking Titan, which is the fighting mancy uh fighting monster slugathon, fantasy slugathon from Avalon Hill Games.

570
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,120
It was produced in nineteen eighty, you'll need to get it on eBay.

571
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,040
There's a later edition, but the later edition is not so glorious because

572
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:18,140
It uses more modern artwork and the extremely simple and stylized artwork in the original is much clearer.

573
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,620
Anyway, that's the the the basic of it.

574
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,320
Um, this is a game in which you well, it has everything that's wrong with games.

575
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,160
Um, it goes on forever.

576
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,080
It's possible to have player illness.

577
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,960
There are large periods of the game where many people are sitting around while two people do something.

578
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,520
Um

579
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,760
And nevertheless, it's one of my favourite games of all time, but I haven't played it for a long time, and it is sitting downstairs.

580
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,320
I have told my family today is the day.

581
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,400
And after the podcast is over we're going to play it.

582
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,280
So if it turns out to be absolutely appalling, um I will send a pickup to John.

583
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,640
But the the the kind of

584
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,940
Key things about this game that make it special.

585
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:05,980
The first is that you have a bunch of Legion's armies and they can recruit new

586
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,460
members based on what they've got already and the terrain that you are in.

587
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,460
So your stacks genera gradually improve.

588
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:21,020
And if you end up fighting, you are fighting in the terrain that you're in and that massively affects

589
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,539
um the the way the fighting goes.

590
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:27,299
And the it doesn't have any area of control.

591
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,700
You kind of wander around the board.

592
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:36,660
So you don't necessarily get any say over where you're gonna be fighting and it's just a great game.

593
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,900
Um you have a Titan, you don't want him to get

594
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:47,600
caught he's very strong so you quite want to use him in battles but if he gets killed you're out of the game so it's um it's it's it's slightly

595
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:52,579
interesting compared to a lot of games where the titular piece is quite weak.

596
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,980
In this one the titular piece becomes very strong indeed, especially if the game goes on.

597
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,020
Um and you have to I don't know and I I used to absolutely love it.

598
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,859
I don't know if I'll still love it.

599
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,140
We'll see.

600
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,020
Interesting.

601
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:10,060
So I've I've looked at the board and it's like it's like if hexagons and parallelograms had a baby almost.

602
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,340
They're like triangles, but they're actually hexagons.

603
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,279
They're they're truncated triangles, the the hexagons with three long sides and three short sides.

604
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,640
Um and those are your little terrains and

605
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,660
You can't move all over this board.

606
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:30,980
You can only essentially you there's an inner bit where you can move pretty freely and then there is a middle bit and an outer bit.

607
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,460
where you can only move in one direction and moving between the things is quite tricky.

608
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:44,060
And critically you roll one die at the start of your turn and that is how far your legions move

609
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:47,780
and you can move as many of them as you like, but you need to move at least one.

610
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,420
Um and that is that is a very weird thing.

611
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:56,180
So you can get somebody who's in a very strong position who rolls badly, you can get somebody who's in a not so great position who rolls

612
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,000
Oh it's great game.

613
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,640
Oh, I'll see.

614
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,840
I'll see if I still like it.

615
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,440
It's probably a very old-fashioned game.

616
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,280
People do still play it a lot, and people still do love it a lot.

617
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,600
Um, but I haven't played it for a long time.

618
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,240
You will have to report back.

619
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,119
Um, yeah.

620
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:20,680
Well I'll be sending you a pickup going, Oh my god, everything about my pick was a desi in fact I'll do it now.

621
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:23,559
I'll do two sorts, two pickups for you, John

622
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
I'll I'll let you know tomorrow which one to use.

623
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,060
The first one is Oh and we had such a good time.

624
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,340
The only problem was we were still playing at midnight and we started at noon.

625
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Oh god, I remember what games used to be like, but never mind, it was great, we loved it.

626
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,079
And the second one is Oh my goodness.

627
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,200
Oh oh God it took Stephen about four hours to make his first move.

628
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,160
Oh I I just I don't know what I was thinking.

629
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,160
Clearly this was a disaster.

630
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,020
What are those?

631
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:58,299
I mean, it sounds like the sort of game I would hate, so I mean it is a war game, but it it's a war game with with monsters.

632
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,819
It's got lots of monsters

633
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,960
I actually just realized what I should have picked, but I can pick the pick blah, but I can pick it next time.

634
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,520
Are you picking railway effing rivals?

635
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,640
Ha ha ha!

636
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,280
No list.

637
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,960
No, I was not gonna pick that.

638
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,200
Haven't you already picked Railway Rivals?

639
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,440
I don't think so.

640
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,000
It doesn't have any genre components at all.

641
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,560
Mm-mm.

642
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,140
Well I I suppose if you play the Middle Earth map it does.

643
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:23,619
Mm-hmm.

644
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:27,859
But I haven't played the Middle Earth map on account of how well I just haven't really.

645
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,779
I do have it, because um

646
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,380
Friend of the show Peter Sullivan gave me a copy.

647
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:37,740
Oh M Mid Middle Earth doesn't have trains, but you know what does have trains?

648
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,940
Star Wars.

649
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,980
Aurindia.

650
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:42,059
Alright, what what's Oryndia?

651
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,500
Oh, Blue Prince Place.

652
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,380
It's yeah, it's a large continent in Blueprints.

653
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,000
Right.

654
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,400
And the the game takes expla takes place entirely in one house.

655
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,320
So there are no trains involved, but yes, technically in the world somewhere there are trains.

656
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,400
There's

657
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,800
There's some track.

658
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,840
There's some track.

659
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,440
I can imagine trains.

660
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,360
I can also imagine trains.

661
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:12,720
The the the track is where I gave up because I realized I had got the mine car at the wrong end of the track and I was gonna have to run like

662
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:19,339
The whole day again, but with the minecart at the right end of the track, and that was when my brain went, Nope, we've had enough of this game now.

663
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:20,859
We're gonna play

664
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,560
Something else.

665
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,120
Yeah.

666
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
Oh, there's so much more game after that.

667
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,320
Oh my god.

668
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:31,000
Oh no no no, not the first time with the track, like uh about the seventh time I'd moved it around.

669
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,480
I didn't like half the sigils and got bored.

670
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,280
Hmm.

671
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:34,680
Mm-hmm.

672
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:37,240
That was the Octothorpe Podcast, and it's goodbye for me.

673
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,599
It's goodbye for me.

674
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,280
And it's goodbye for me.

675
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,880
Be fair I went to IKEA for lunch, so You went to IKEA for lunch?

676
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:04,440
Yeah.

677
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,160
Boom.

678
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,440
Oh god.

679
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:09,400
I that that makes because they closed our IKEA.

680
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,599
Ikea is dead to me now.

681
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,760
Our Ikea is city centre, so

682
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,720
Uh was there an Ikea in Walthamstow?

683
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,440
There was an Ikea in um Edfield.

684
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,080
Yeah.

685
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,080
I think I went there once and bought furniture.

686
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,320
Ten minutes drive from here is the point.

687
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,200
So it's a it's a big it's a big it's a big loss.

688
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
We did used to go there for lunch.

689
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:27,859
Literally.

690
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,700
