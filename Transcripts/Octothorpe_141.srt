00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,120
Can I keep that in the podcast? Please, can I keep that in the podcast? Please?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,920
You'll have to search your conscience, John. It's on your head, John.

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:33,300
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the very 141st episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,600
which is landing on the island, making its way to a local pub, staying the night amidst the temptations of the locals,

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,280
and then emerging blearily-eyed into the morning on the 14th of August 2025.

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,580
I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,760
I'm Alison Scott.

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,860
And I'm Liz Batty.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,760
And if you are listening to this at Seattle at the Worldcon, stop listening.

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,540
Go and do fun things, but I hope you're having a nice time.

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,840
Yes, indeed.

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,760
Yeah, this is due to drop in the middle of the Worldcon.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,120
I hope everyone's having a lovely time.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,840
I'm attending virtually, but I don't know how much of it I will get to because it is in the summer.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
Summer of fun!

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,060
I'm going to have to sleep all winter to recover from my summer.

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,540
Shall we do some letters of comments?

18
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,520
Yes.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,280
Can I start?

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,280
Why not?

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,480
We heard from first-time emailer Chris Hurley, who says,

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:29,120
Dear Octothorpe, as one of those for whom Glasgow was their first Worldcon, welcome to the club, Chris.

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,680
I thought the WUSPUS membership plus attending was a little complex, but made sense once I read about it and understood what WUSPUS was.

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,180
Whereas I thought E2 made things more confusing, as I don't know what a supporting member is.

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,740
And I was associating that almost exclusively with the pre-supporting a prospective Worldcon.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,560
So this is a very good example, thank you Chris, of a member who is in the new paradigm and is like,

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,040
Yeah, but what you're all on about with the old stuff, that doesn't make any sense at all.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,960
No one new wrote in to tell us that the old model made more sense than the new one does.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,860
A data!

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,620
One data point!

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:04,720
Yes.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,800
Let's extrapolate wildly from it.

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
Yes!

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,200
Whatever we want it to support.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:20,420
Indeed, we also heard from Ivan Sinner on this topic on Facebook, who basically said he's been out of the loop for a while,

36
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:27,380
and he found it a little bit confusing until he got his head around it because he was looking for the old words and he had to learn the new ones.

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,400
But he notes he spent a large chunk of time on the registration desk and he didn't encounter a single question regarding the membership type.

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
The most common question was, can I have a ribbon?

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,880
Slash, why have you run out of the ribbons?

40
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,780
Which, fair enough, makes a lot of sense.

41
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,740
And then finally, we heard from Dave O'Neill, who sent us a lot saying,

42
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:57,780
The other issue that nobody on the American side of the pond wants to talk about with the word ticket is that tickets incur local taxes in some places,

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,500
which is one of those things we've been pretending not to think about.

44
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,260
And that's a good point.

45
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:10,260
And that was one of the other things people were discussing with E2 is calling them attending memberships might make them less likely to attract tax.

46
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:18,800
But I don't know whether you can just call something an attending membership that is a bundle of the WUSFUS membership and the attending supplement.

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,880
And I don't know how local laws look on that.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,600
And honestly, I sort of rather suspect that local laws don't look too closely at this sort of thing.

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,540
But maybe I am wrong.

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,900
Or more accurately, I think they don't until they do.

51
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,920
And then it's a massive problem.

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,680
Yeah, I think they mostly don't, you know, I don't think they notice.

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,340
But I think if they did, I think the fact that, you know, you call your Victoria's sponge a biscuit does not make it a biscuit.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:50,160
Yeah, I strongly suspect that if the taxman decided we owed the taxman tax, saying, but we've used a different noun, wouldn't actually save us.

55
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,240
Because, you know, they've got lawyers and stuff.

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:04:02,780
And then we would have to face the real question of, is it worth not paying the tax by employing a legal company more money than the tax bill we owe to fight the tax bill?

57
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,800
And I don't know what the answer to that is.

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,540
Convention treasurers, write in.

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,060
But thank you very much for writing in Dave.

60
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:18,420
Dave also missed just on Blue Sky, basically being like, is anyone going to be very upset if someone didn't make it onto the Michael Protection Committee because someone was on a slate that made it on?

61
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,200
And, I mean, it's probably not the most urgent problem in fandom at the moment.

62
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,900
Dave might have a good point there.

63
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,340
Do we always have to talk about the urgent problems?

64
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,380
Can't we sometimes talk about the technically interesting and funny ones?

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,840
I think we've made a good go of not always discussing the urgent problems.

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,720
Well, that segues nicely into a letter we received from Nicholas White.

67
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,660
It does.

68
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:50,960
Who, you know, we said that no one had tried to make a motion to change the Mark Protection Committee voting procedure.

69
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,560
And he points out, well, it didn't seem like a super high priority and also probably not something to pass in Chengdu, which was likely attended.

70
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,880
And then 2024 and 2025 are very busy.

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
So, fair enough.

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,200
But Nicholas says he would like to form a committee of the willing to find a way of proposing a reform next year.

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:17,520
And if anyone would like to volunteer for said committee of the willing, please contact Nicholas at email to nicholas.white at gmail.com.

74
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,780
And the Nicholas has an H in it and white is spelt with a Y.

75
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,560
If you are having any problems, just like messages on a text-based platform and we will provide.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:34,080
And then Nicholas does also point that while we are very kind to credit him with spotting the potential for E2 to disenfranchise World Cup attending members,

77
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,460
the person who spotted that was actually Andrew January.

78
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,820
Nicholas was not the only one to point this out, but I figured Nicholas can be the person of record to point this out.

79
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,180
Thank you very much for writing in, Nicholas.

80
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,380
Should we do more business meeting stuff?

81
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,940
Sorry, you were going to segue nicely.

82
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,920
It's lots of business meeting stuff.

83
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,880
It's interesting business meeting stuff, so.

84
00:05:51,200 --> 00:06:00,580
We have quite a lot to say on various things to do with the business meeting, partly inspired by messages from Tammy Cox and Anne Jesse Lip,

85
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,380
but we will be covering that later in the episode, listeners.

86
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,600
So, yes, foreshadowing.

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,960
Just in case you thought you might go a whole episode without business meeting content.

88
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,340
Nula wrote to us on Blue Sky to say,

89
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,000
the whole idea of there being a trial just strikes me as insane.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,700
I wasn't at the meeting, but I know nothing more than the short info,

91
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,700
but I'm very uncomfortable with the use of quasi-legal language.

92
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,640
And I believe that this is an artefact of Robert's Rules of Order,

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,280
that we are using a provision in Robert's Rules,

94
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,640
and that provision talks about trials.

95
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,000
And that is why we are talking about a trial.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,080
But I agree with Nula that this sounds really weird to a kind of British mindset,

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,120
especially probably an elderly British mindset.

98
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,640
Nula is elderly, just me.

99
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,300
Well, it also isn't Nula Irish.

100
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,340
That is true.

101
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,720
But she lives in the UK, so, you know.

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,820
Nula is Irish.

103
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,480
Yes, indeed.

104
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,540
Does it sound weird to a British mindset, or does it sound weird?

105
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,360
I don't know.

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,880
Does it?

107
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,580
Because it sounded weird.

108
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,180
Trials sounded really weird.

109
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,340
But then somebody was like, well, it's in the Robert's Rules.

110
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,200
That's why it's a trial.

111
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,520
It does sound weird, but we cannot provide any non-British viewpoints apart from Nula's.

112
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,540
Yes.

113
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,080
Yeah.

114
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,680
So there's a question here, which is, does it sound weird?

115
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,500
Is this just another thing that is weird and wrong about Robert's Rules?

116
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,940
Because, you know, it could go on the list.

117
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,540
It's, I don't know what, what would you call it if it wasn't that, I guess is the question.

118
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,280
Inquiry.

119
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,860
Yeah.

120
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,320
Yeah, could call it an inquiry.

121
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,800
Does that make it sound like it's a governmental thing?

122
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,600
I don't know.

123
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,260
Or an examiner.

124
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,740
I mean, it's basically coming, it's not prosecuting, is it?

125
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,760
What it comes up with is going to come back for ratification to the...

126
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,660
I think it is prosecuting.

127
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,740
I think, I think WUSFUS appoints officers who prosecute the case.

128
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,520
And they prosecute the case to the trial committee who make a decision based on the evidence that has been presented by the prosecution.

129
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,680
And that doesn't then come back to the main committee next year?

130
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,160
I don't know how that works.

131
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,500
I am insufficiently versed in...

132
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,460
We don't know.

133
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,660
Read us on the trial committee, write in.

134
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,200
I don't know because I wasn't at that bit of the business meeting.

135
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,220
Were you guys at that bit of the business meeting?

136
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:21,420
I was, but like, and it was explained in terms of Warren and the other person from WUSFUS would effectively be taking the role of the prosecution.

137
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,240
The trial committee would be hearing evidence and making judgments.

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:36,080
But I don't know if the detail on how that would be rendered in LA was explained in kind of a lot of detail.

139
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:46,820
Because obviously the brunt of it was focused on, you know, do we actually want to have a prosecution and accountability at all or not?

140
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:55,680
I was assuming they would come back to the meeting as a whole because it seems like every other committee comes back to the meeting as a whole to report and make proposals that we vote on them.

141
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,920
So that's what I was assuming.

142
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,880
Someone write an FN roll?

143
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,620
I think the thing is that it's an odd thing that's happened.

144
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,460
I guess you could call it like a disciplinary process or whatever.

145
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,020
But it's a bit different because it's different, right, from...

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,960
I was going to associate it with, like, if you get investigated by your employer, but your employer doesn't appoint, like, a jury of your other colleagues to work out whether they want to fire you.

147
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,780
So, yeah, I don't know.

148
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,660
It's weird.

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:29,760
I think part of the problem is that it's weird because there's not a lot of direct analogues in, like, other organisations other than, you know, parliamentary ones.

150
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,020
And so it uses the language of those organisations.

151
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,080
And I don't know what other language you could use that maps as nicely onto it.

152
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,720
I take the point that it doesn't rise to the level of, like, an actual trial for, like, a murder.

153
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,960
So we should issue them, like, a fixed penalty notice or something.

154
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,640
Oh.

155
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,780
Can we give them ASBOs?

156
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,020
It's just fun to say.

157
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,920
ASBOs.

158
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,280
American listeners, look up ASBO on Google.

159
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,420
Oh, and then Google for ASBO Swan because that's quite fun.

160
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,980
I think an ASBO is exactly what I want here.

161
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,820
They're a bit old for it, though, aren't they?

162
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,040
I have no idea.

163
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't think ASBOs are age limited.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,140
Have any of them ever worn a hoodie?

165
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,840
We can't name any of them, listeners, so, you know.

166
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,420
But I do, yeah, I take Nuala's point.

167
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,260
I don't know.

168
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,140
It's tricky.

169
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,200
Sorry, now I'm looking up pictures of the ASBO Swan.

170
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,460
It was a very angry swan that used to live on the cam.

171
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
Amazing.

172
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,980
I don't know exactly how the trial committee reporting back works, but I did hear from Jesse.

173
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,300
So Jesse wrote in about some of the stuff we said last time.

174
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,420
And one of the things they said was,

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,680
Jesse has had exhaustive conversations with Warren about what the trial committee and reporting back process will look like.

176
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,080
And Jesse says they will have basically no influence over any of it.

177
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:50,300
And notes that folks who have not had those exhaustive combos don't have the same understanding of my role or the lack thereof in what will happen.

178
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,300
And that came up in the context of the conflict of interest stuff we were talking about last time.

179
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,900
But I think that, yeah, that is an evolving process and we will see how it goes.

180
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,000
But yes, thank you for letting us know, Jesse.

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,240
But my impression is that the presiding officer doesn't have much to do with it.

182
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,620
So I don't know how much impact the body can have on it either.

183
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,820
But we'll see.

184
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,280
But I changed the about thing.

185
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:21,960
Alison has just learned that my bets that Alison would not change the thing.

186
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,660
No, I changed it.

187
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,320
I did change it.

188
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,960
No, you clearly didn't because it's not changed, is it?

189
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,620
I changed it during Octothorpe last week.

190
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,380
Why did it not stay changed?

191
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,400
Because you were doing 17 things at once and you tried to do it during the podcast and you forgot to hit apply or something like that.

192
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,800
So Neil Ottenstein writes in to tell us that everyone owes me a penny,

193
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,540
which by my reckoning means that I have made roughly £3.56.

194
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,240
If everyone could send those in through PayPal or through dropping them in my drinks at the next Eastercon, that would be great.

195
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,300
And Paul Weimer noted that the Blue Sky bio has indeed changed.

196
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,360
Well done, Liz.

197
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,080
Executive functional round.

198
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,040
I clearly didn't hit save.

199
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,540
That's plausible, isn't it?

200
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,940
Extremely plausible, yes.

201
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,460
And we heard from Rory Hennell James on Blue Sky, who says,

202
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm only listening because you won an award, or at least I started listening after I saw your acceptance speech.

203
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,340
Thank you very much.

204
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,320
That's pretty good.

205
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,160
I also hope there were lots of kind of similarly confused and or baffled people in the audience who were then like,

206
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,420
well, that speech was okay and they got off the stage quickly.

207
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,300
Maybe I should check out this podcast.

208
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,080
Brevity is important.

209
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,640
When they asked us to send in videoed acceptance speeches for this year, they said,

210
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,240
keep your remarks down to 45 seconds.

211
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,120
And I'll tell you, that's not a lot.

212
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,760
I did not keep my remarks down to 45 seconds because I thought it was a nonsense.

213
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,780
If somebody wins in person, it's going to take more than 45 seconds to get them onto the stage, isn't it?

214
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,580
So it seemed very unreasonable.

215
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,780
I noted that the Hugo ceremony this year starts at 8.30 and I thought that's a bit late,

216
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,980
although someone then pointed out that Glasgow started at 8.

217
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,740
But I think that's quite late because really you want to finish in time for people to go

218
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,200
and have either a celebratory drink or a commiseratory drink after.

219
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,960
And if you're going on to like 10.30, 11, that's a bit late.

220
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,620
It's the Sabbath, isn't it?

221
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,420
Oh.

222
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,340
And it's in a northern latitude, isn't it?

223
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,200
Maybe.

224
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:28,380
So John Hertz typed a page with a screenshot from File 770 and then had FedEx scan it in

225
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,700
and email it to people.

226
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,360
And we have had that.

227
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,960
So that's whatever acronym that makes of comment.

228
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,760
And he said,

229
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,100
Dear recent woofer,

230
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,100
I found you among contributors to the 2022-2024 woofs

231
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,280
and wanted to make sure you'd seen that woof is happening at Seattle.

232
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,520
So I will put a link to the File 770, which I have copied from.

233
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,940
So I have copied because my Mac has OCR'd the screenshot that John has pasted in the thing

234
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,580
and it's got like JPEG artifacts that he pasted into his typewritten letter

235
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,300
that FedEx has scanned and sent to us.

236
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,100
Technology.

237
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,860
But yes, if you're going to Seattle and you're an avid fan writer

238
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,320
and, you know, you've got time sort of now as you're listening to this,

239
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,400
then you too could commit to woof.

240
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,880
But yes, thank you very much for communicating with us, John.

241
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,340
I don't think John listens.

242
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,840
Well, I mean...

243
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Also, we've never contributed to woof.

244
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,680
What?

245
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,620
We've never, like, Ogtthorpe, comment at ogtthorpecast.uk has never contributed to woof, so...

246
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,200
He sent it to lots of, like, science fiction media organizations.

247
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,780
Honestly, I'm delighted because not many of our listeners have gone so far as to,

248
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,020
like, typewrite something, sign on it by hand,

249
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,920
take it to a FedEx office and get it scanned and sent to us.

250
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,060
That's quite a lot of effort.

251
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,240
I mean, please don't do it every week, but, you know, it's quite nice.

252
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,040
He said he was having an electronic moment.

253
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:09,120
Shall we talk about the business meeting?

254
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,700
I mean, I guess, yes.

255
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:20,500
As previously noted, Jesse Lip has been in touch this week in a plethora of modes of discourse.

256
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,040
Good and accurate use of the word plethora.

257
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,760
Well done.

258
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,380
What do we want to start with?

259
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,280
Do you want me to do a bit?

260
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,960
Yes.

261
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,760
Liz, you go.

262
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:34,260
After the business meeting, the fourth business meeting, they released a survey you could fill in.

263
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,180
And they have very quickly gone through and processed all this data and made us some nice infographics.

264
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,560
And there's nothing we love more than taking a good infographic and trying to talk it through on a podcast.

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,040
So that's what I'm going to do.

266
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,140
So some highlights from it are that the average attendance was 160 across the meetings that they got.

267
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:01,860
50% of attendees gave them feedback, which is pretty good, of which 40% of respondents thought they were a business meeting regular,

268
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,360
which is interesting because I'm not sure how I would define business meeting regular.

269
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,900
And I'm not sure.

270
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,120
I can't remember what I ticked if I said yes or no.

271
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,100
I think I said yes, because I probably am.

272
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,560
But I don't think of myself as a business meeting regular.

273
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,480
Anyway, and there are also 42 plus first time business meeting attendees.

274
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Can I just say, Jessie says in Facebook, shout out to the person who said it's complicated as the answer to,

275
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,940
do you consider yourself to be a business meeting regular?

276
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,940
And that was me.

277
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,900
Oh, I mean, I've been to more than one, but I don't go every time.

278
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,540
I think I might be frequent, but not regular.

279
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,980
You're on a roll today, John.

280
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,200
You really are.

281
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,400
I wanted to highlight something here, which is Liz said it was pretty good that 50% of people responded.

282
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,460
That is, I would say, astoundingly fucking good.

283
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,600
Like, as someone who's worked in science engagement, like, oh, how did you get that number?

284
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
That's insane.

285
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,440
That tells you everything you need to know about the sort of people who go to the business meeting, John.

286
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,520
But it also says how engaged people are in wanting to report their opinion on what happened.

287
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,560
Like, that's interesting to me.

288
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,120
Sorry, Liz, I just wanted to...

289
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,680
No, that's fair.

290
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,800
I probably understated and said that a bit.

291
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,620
So some of the things I thought were interesting.

292
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,860
61% of respondents would not have been able to attend an in-person meeting this year.

293
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,680
So obviously that's respondents, not total attendance.

294
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,460
And it's possible that people who are attending in person, you know, they may have been less likely to fill this in,

295
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,960
or they may have been too busy to fill it in if they go in Seattle.

296
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
But that's quite interesting.

297
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,500
Which formats would you be able to attend?

298
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:41,640
They give kind of the number of people who think they would have been able to attend various different permutations from fully online and hybrid and in-person on different dates.

299
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,340
And also, which business meeting format would you pick for next year when given the options of online, hybrid or in-person?

300
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,800
73% would pick online, 16% hybrid and only 11% in-person.

301
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,520
Yeah.

302
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,780
There's an obvious problem here, which is you have an online business meeting and then the feedback says,

303
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,960
yes, let's have that meeting next year online.

304
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,880
But that's still quite a high percentage given that it includes quite a lot of business meeting regulars as well.

305
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,240
So it's not solely new people who only came when it was online.

306
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,740
And also, so I think there has been noted that people have said in the comments,

307
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,020
like obviously there is a sampling bias there because you are sampling the people who attended the online business meeting.

308
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:28,920
I will say I think quite a lot of people who did not want there to be an online business meeting attended the online business meeting to try to get the online business meeting to go away.

309
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:35,800
And I suspect those people would be quite highly motivated to fill in the feedback survey to make sure that there wasn't that effect.

310
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,540
So I think you probably actually, I'm not sure how big an effect that will be.

311
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:46,660
I do think they need to rerun the survey at the in-person component of the meeting with people who attend that to see how that differs.

312
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,080
The problem there is, it's a smaller pool.

313
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:58,940
And I wanted to pick out something that Jesse posted in our Facebook, but hasn't posted on the infographics thread.

314
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,240
Jesse posted in our Facebook group, historical business meeting attendance based on the counted vote totals.

315
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:16,260
And I think what this chart shows is the minimum number of people who voted on a thing and the maximum number of people who voted on a thing in 2025.

316
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,700
So the vote that had the largest number of votes was 148 people voting.

317
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:30,860
And the vote that had the minimum number of votes was 98 people voting, which is interesting in the context of the average attendance being 160 and the total attendees being 262.

318
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:39,680
According to the Lumi logins, that indicates that even the most voted on vote probably didn't get everyone voting.

319
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,440
And that could be for a number of reasons.

320
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:50,120
But if you compare the, so if you use the number of people voting method to go back in previous business meetings.

321
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,580
So if you use the median, so the median number of people voting in this year's was 120.

322
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:02,560
That is higher than any year in the last decade, except for 2015 and 2016.

323
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,160
So 2015, the median was 168 and 2016, the median was 139.

324
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,500
And that's, long-time listeners might remember that that's because of the puppies.

325
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,940
So there were a lot of people in the room trying to work out how to stop the puppies from stealing the Hugos.

326
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,700
And it attracted a lot of attention.

327
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:28,820
Put it this way, so 2024's like median vote total was 63% of this year's.

328
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,360
The DC vote total was 44%.

329
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,020
And like Lung Con 3 was 66%.

330
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,240
Just to pick out a couple of examples.

331
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:44,180
And so this indicates that I would say that the online business meeting, you see a jump of about 50% from Glasgow.

332
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,140
So Glasgow's median was 76% and 2025 was 120%.

333
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,160
So that's a 50% increase year on year.

334
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,840
And so that is actually, we discussed it last time as it's about in the same ballpark.

335
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,860
But it's actually not.

336
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:00,740
It's quite a lot bigger this year than it has been for a long time, except for very controversial business meetings.

337
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,840
And that is interesting.

338
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,680
And there's two ways to explain that, right?

339
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,480
One is, it could have expanded participation.

340
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,100
Or the other is, this is a very controversial business meeting because it was online.

341
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,520
And also because it had all of the Chengdu stuff happening.

342
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,520
But then I would have expected the controversy from Chengdu to also bleed over to 2024.

343
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,480
So...

344
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,800
I think it was kind of smashing.

345
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,620
And next year, I will be a bit careful about the diary dates than I was this year, if it happens again.

346
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,960
And I'm sure I'm not alone in that.

347
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,060
This is me doing vibes, not statistics here again.

348
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,180
But you'd think it would grow if we got into the habit of this.

349
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,880
I mean, I'm assuming there are a bunch of people who are interested in business meetings who aren't actually getting to them at the moment.

350
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,060
But I might be wrong about that.

351
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:49,080
I mean, we'll be out here promoting the business meeting as the best way you can spend an evening or four evenings in a site selection report.

352
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,740
Yes.

353
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,460
The next Richard Curtis movie.

354
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:01,880
Listeners, please write in next year to see if you can get a shiny penny for whether Alison remembered to keep her schedule clear for the business meeting.

355
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:08,600
I'm just going to point out that our Facebook page currently says that we are a Hugot award-winning podcast.

356
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,740
It says what?

357
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,160
It says we are a Hugot award-winning podcast.

358
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,360
And yes, I have taken a screen cap for when you go and edit it.

359
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,760
Oh, Liz.

360
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,580
Oh, you deployed that at quite the right time.

361
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,640
Actually, I think that could just be our cover-up, right?

362
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,100
That is quite good.

363
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,720
Yes.

364
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,540
Okay, fine.

365
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,300
Maybe I should.

366
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,540
Cognitive decline is a problem, right?

367
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,560
Do you want to talk about the cost thing?

368
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:51,100
Last time we discussed the cost of Lumi, I guess wrapped up in that discussion of cost was a question about whether or not it would be better to try and make our own that's free.

369
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,740
Or whether we might end up doing that.

370
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:02,480
Tammy and Jesse had a conversation about that in the comments on Blue Sky.

371
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:14,040
So Tammy says one barrier that she sees to inter-interesting a virtual BM is that Jesse is good at chairing but probably doesn't want to or shouldn't chair every year.

372
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,620
And also asked Jesse to comment on how hard it would be to roll your own combination.

373
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,120
And I won't try and recap the whole conversation.

374
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:34,540
But basically, I think the thing that stood out as the main thing you'd need to be very careful about is that you need a platform that is gated and credentialed.

375
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:44,140
So Lumi has a couple of features which only people who are confirmed to be allowed to join the Zoom can join the Zoom, which is like a key feature, especially if you're in executive session.

376
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:51,220
But the other thing Lumi does is that every member gets one vote no matter how many devices they have or similar.

377
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,500
And Lumi kind of handles all of that as well.

378
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,560
And so it might well be that making a system to replace Lumi would be very difficult.

379
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:12,400
Jesse notes that because we need the credentialed part of the Lumi to do that on Zoom, you would have to spend a lot of money because you can't easily do it on the little Zooms.

380
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,640
You have to get one of the corporate Zooms because you need to create a user per attendee.

381
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:24,480
And so that means your Zoom cost is like already five grand because you can't do it in the way we've done it for like punctuation.

382
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,980
You need the corporate features, which cost a lot more.

383
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:35,560
But Jesse does also note the three developers who were on meeting staff this year want to work with me to create a document with the requirements for a minimum viable product.

384
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,680
So that is interesting.

385
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,780
Do we want do we have anything else on poetry?

386
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:51,380
This year, the Scalzi Foundation provided Jesse notes in their email a portion of the cost, not the whole cost of the Lumi platform, which is all very interesting.

387
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,520
It might be that you really do need Lumi and you can't do it without it.

388
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,040
But then my question is, is the $20,000?

389
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,640
Because Tammy's original point was it will be hard to entrench the business meeting without the chair pool.

390
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:11,400
And I wonder whether convincing every ConCom as a kind of de facto, oh, we just definitely spend this $20,000 every year, right?

391
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
I think you'll eventually find a ConCom that doesn't want to spend that 20K.

392
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:32,340
And I was going to ask Liz, Liz, from the program perspective, if you were running a program item that hit 200 people virtually at a WorldCon, what would your budget that you would feel able to ask for from a DHB for that program item?

393
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,760
And is it $20,000?

394
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,900
I mean, it's a good question.

395
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,880
I don't know.

396
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:48,100
Should we really be looking at it like all program items should provide us some sort of value for money in terms of number of people entertained?

397
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,140
I don't know.

398
00:25:49,140 --> 00:26:03,320
And also, should the business meeting count as a program item that is, you know, there to entice people to come to your Con or a basic function of the Con, which also I think would come under the WUSFUS division, not program division?

399
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,360
It's a requirement of the convention to run the business meeting.

400
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,980
Yeah, but it's not a requirement of the convention to run the business meeting in a way using this particular expensive platform online.

401
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,940
You could just say, oh, we're doing it in this broom cupboard.

402
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,420
That's exactly my point.

403
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,880
As long as we don't start before 10am, I think, or maybe we rescinded that one.

404
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,920
You know, there's not a requirement there for them to do whatever the community feels is the best way to run the business meeting.

405
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,880
There's just a requirement to run a business meeting.

406
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,120
That's the thing, right?

407
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:44,640
If the amount of money you typically spend on making 200 members' lives better is significantly less than 20k, I am sceptical that online business meetings will last longer than a couple of years.

408
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,780
I think they will go straight back to being in person.

409
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,180
Because I think Concoms will look at that and be like, that is not worth the return on investment we will see on the money.

410
00:26:52,180 --> 00:27:01,160
And that's why I ask it in the context of program, because the program is where we are used to thinking about returns on investments for membership experience.

411
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:08,720
Well, you could alternatively look at events where there are events that cost that amount of money for quite small attendances sometimes.

412
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,660
Though not, I think, the Hugos.

413
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,600
I think the Hugos cost significantly more than $20,000.

414
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:25,420
Because once you include kind of the tech costs and convention space costs for second stage, I think you're starting to hit those sorts of numbers there.

415
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,540
And some of those items are often not well attended.

416
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:35,320
Yeah, I just, I'm trying to, I'm struggling to think of anything where I have thought how many people come to this and will enjoy it.

417
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:40,660
It's more a case of, does this offer something that I can't get in another way?

418
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:50,120
For example, if there was a great science speaker who would come and do it, but only for a $10,000 donation or something, then you'd say, no, I have great science speakers at home.

419
00:27:50,120 --> 00:28:00,320
And I'm sure we spend quite a lot of money on things like live music and live theatre, which are proportionately extremely expensive compared to the audience you might get.

420
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:08,720
Whereas if you put on, say, say you did like a funny, just a minute style panel or something, you could probably get a big audience for that much lower outlay.

421
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:17,980
So I think there's that, I think you also have to balance up how much does the business meeting cost to run in person and how much of that crossover with the Lumi, right?

422
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,040
Because for the Lumi, we had live captioning.

423
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,100
If you're having an in-person business meeting, you also need live captioning.

424
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,180
So those costs the same.

425
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:30,740
You do have a big space, which you don't necessarily pay extra, as we said, but you know, you have now this extra space you can use.

426
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,360
You basically have a big programme room.

427
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,640
You can put 12 to 15 items in probably across the course of the convention.

428
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,680
That's not a trivial amount of stuff.

429
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:46,260
And also the business meeting does require things like live streaming and so on in recent years that you maybe would not need.

430
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,320
So I think it's not quite 20k versus zero.

431
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,860
It's like maybe 20k versus however much it costs.

432
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,980
But I'm more optimistic than you.

433
00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:00,120
I think that they'll probably keep finding it for a few years if there is a willingness from the WISFERS team to run a virtual business meeting.

434
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,200
I think your problem is more that I don't know anyone else who is rushing to chair one.

435
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,460
The question is whether the product is great as well.

436
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:22,600
Because I think if having virtual business meetings tampers down some of the kind of kerfuffles around WISFERS, and I think it might, especially if participation increases, which I think it will.

437
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,160
That might be $20,000 well spent in the context of a Worldcon budget.

438
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,180
Yeah, that's fair.

439
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,200
And it might grow.

440
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,880
And I assume that that's not, that $20,000 is basically the same whether you have 200 or 2,000 people at the meeting.

441
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:45,260
The other consideration is, I think if you are a Worldcon that has its stuff together, you might decide to do this because you think it's the right thing to do.

442
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:56,880
My worry is that the more obstacles there are to seeing this as clearly a direct win over holding an in-person one, the more likely it is that Worldcon will not do it.

443
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:07,400
And so, for instance, Montreal, which I suspect will be relatively poorly attended and does not seem to be a very together convention, I can very much imagine them not doing this.

444
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,620
Because they might not have the money and they might not have, you know, the spoons.

445
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,580
And Tammy did ask Montreal on Blue Sky.

446
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,700
And as far as I know, Montreal has not commented.

447
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:30,940
Two things to say, which is, one, I'm not assuming Montreal will be small because I think there might be people who have chosen not to go to US Worldcons for a couple of years who quite like the idea of going to Worldcon again.

448
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,640
And also, we don't necessarily know it will be a financial decision.

449
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:45,360
It might be they have a head and parliamentary set up for the WUSFUS meeting in 2027, would prefer to do an in-person one and decide they're going to do an in-person one regardless of money.

450
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,520
So that might not be the only criteria that they use to decide.

451
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,900
I think there's a lot of things in it.

452
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,540
Jesse did note, I love the idea of showing voting results like everyone votes, though.

453
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,700
I love the idea of having everyone at the meeting create a custom avatar and animating them actually voting.

454
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,100
Maybe we can get sponsored by a visual effects company.

455
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,700
And if there's ever another ConZealand, we could get Weta to do it.

456
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,300
Right?

457
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,960
And that would be dope.

458
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,200
I want Weta to do all our avatars.

459
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,080
Yes.

460
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,900
They should just let you pick through the Weta-like past library.

461
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,320
So, you know, you can be an Ent or an Orc or...

462
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,180
Bagsy Treebeard.

463
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,440
Could I be Aragorn?

464
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,620
Yeah, they probably did make a fully CGI Aragorn, didn't they?

465
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,880
100%.

466
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,860
I don't know.

467
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,540
Because it was in 2002.

468
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,520
They did less CGI than you think.

469
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,600
Lots of forced perspective and people on stilts and things like that.

470
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,240
Yeah.

471
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,940
Okay, so what do we want to talk about next?

472
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:49,640
I think we should probably mention that F12, which was introducing the Speculative Poetry Hugo Award, passed.

473
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,860
So we'll be down for ratification in Los Angeles.

474
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:58,260
So if you either want or don't want a Speculative Poetry Hugo, you should look out for that next year.

475
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:05,880
I think this was probably a year early because it would have been nice to at least see how many people vote and what happens this year before it was introduced.

476
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,700
But it's very hard to argue against a Hugo category.

477
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,900
Because if you argue against a particular Hugo category, it's because you don't like poets or something.

478
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:20,880
I think if I were a Worldcon, this would make me think really hard about whether to do a special one off Hugo.

479
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:29,820
Because if I think there is a chance that people are going to use that to try and get another permanent Hugo on, and I'm in charge of whether or not to do the special one, I'm just not going to do it.

480
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:37,780
I think we have other Hugo categories where we struggle to find really good finalists.

481
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,640
And I think this is even more at risk of that.

482
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,880
I feel we haven't really thought necessarily thought it through.

483
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,260
I don't hate poets.

484
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:57,020
Maybe I should introduce a one in one out system for the Hugo so that if you propose a new Hugo, you also have to simultaneously propose the one we're going to scrap to let it in.

485
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,800
That wouldn't be controversial, would it?

486
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,040
I mean, I think what we know now is that we ran Best Poem as a category this year.

487
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,600
It got six nominees that are totally fine.

488
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:16,680
We know that nomination numbers in this category for those six were low, but not so low that it stands out massively compared to other categories.

489
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:26,440
And so, you know, if you'd run it as a special Hugo and you said, look, we got 27 nominations for 27 different things, then that would be an obvious case of, all right, well, there's no appetite for this.

490
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,840
So you do have some information as to what Hugo voters think about a poetry category.

491
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:41,520
I just think it would be nice to have seen the whole process through and to know kind of like the long tail of the nominations and to see how many people actually vote and what they vote for before we start saying it should be a permanent category.

492
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,720
But I can understand it's two years to ratification.

493
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:52,400
Then the idea here is it would be first, it would take effect at the end of 2026 and you could have one in 2027 and they may not wish to wait till 2028 for, sorry, Best Poem Hugo.

494
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,200
But I just want to see a bit more like let's do one cycle of it and show it's actually a viable category.

495
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,320
It's interesting, right?

496
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:11,880
Because if LA follows suit after Glasgow and Seattle with doing the consultative votes on ratifications, it'll be interesting to see what the wider membership thinks of the idea of a Best Poem Hugo.

497
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:19,840
And it will also be interesting to see what the number of people who vote either way is because I suspect most people are ambivalent.

498
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,940
Maybe that's unfair, but that is my suspicion.

499
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,740
I mean, I kind of feel that this is the same for like most Hugo votes.

500
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:42,160
I can't remember what year it was there was a proposal to remove Best Semi-Prozine, but I suspect one of the highly attended votes from one of the business meetings was a removing Best Semi-Prozine one.

501
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,080
Because then you can get lots of people to turn up and say, we support Semi-Prozine Hugo, we don't want to remove it.

502
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:58,940
So there's probably like some people who are super in favour, some people who are super against, and then a lot of people who are basically ambivalent on any particular Hugo, I think, apart from maybe Best Novel, where we know lots of people always nominate and vote.

503
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,120
And so then it's just basically impossible to ever remove Hugo.

504
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,380
Do we have anything else on poetry?

505
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,260
No.

506
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,480
Sorry, I just wanted to do that in haiku.

507
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,620
I had no pithy comment in haiku.

508
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,840
I clearly need to plan.

509
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,340
The other thing that happened is that the NASFIC has gone.

510
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,300
It has been removed from the constitution.

511
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,180
Other than the trademark will still be maintained.

512
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:33,000
Although I am sceptical, I don't know how well that will work if we're no longer holding NASFICS, because my understanding is that to keep a trademark, you actually have to show that you're using the trademark.

513
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,620
So we'll see.

514
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,420
We'll see how that goes.

515
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:40,040
But that basically means that the de facto National American Convention is now DragonCon.

516
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,860
Why DragonCon rather than San Diego Comic Con?

517
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,260
Because San Diego Comic Con is a comics convention.

518
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,480
Why not GenCon?

519
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,680
Well, I think what we're saying is it's maybe not as clear cut as John is making it out.

520
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,340
I want to say something here, which is that I went to my first World Con in 1987, which is a long, long time ago.

521
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:10,580
And during that convention, when people were trying to explain the business meeting to me and my head was exploding, I said, why is the NASFIC in the WUSFUS Constitution?

522
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,960
This makes no sense whatsoever.

523
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:18,400
I mean, I didn't say that in those words because I did not know things like WUSFUS at that point or possibly even Constitution.

524
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:33,880
But I did think it was quite strange that quite a lot about the way in which World Con operates in North America was included in this Constitution of something which I thought erroneously was a World Convention, which it now is.

525
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,900
All those only a few years later.

526
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:42,780
In 87, did you have like that weird zonal bidding system where it kind of officially bounced around outside the US once every four years or something?

527
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,020
Yeah.

528
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,340
So I think it had moved away from that.

529
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:52,060
I think you could be outside any of the years, but this is going into history.

530
00:36:52,060 --> 00:37:06,300
But yes, it rotated within the United States and the people in the Wimpy Zone, which is the middle of the country, complained that outside US bids were targeting them.

531
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,720
So in the wider context of what's happening in fan run conventions in the United States.

532
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:19,720
So the only current US World Con bid is Texas in 2031, which is being headed up by Sarah Felix.

533
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,880
And that's quite a long way in the future.

534
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,780
So we'll see what happens.

535
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,580
There are no currently announced World Con bids in the USA.

536
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,420
Other than that, Westacon has come to an end.

537
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,200
So those who don't know, Westacon is a West Coast convention, which has been running for about 50 years.

538
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,060
And that has come to an end because there are not enough people who want to run Westacons.

539
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:45,160
WizCon has stopped running in person because, again, they have not got enough volunteers to run a convention.

540
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:52,400
Gallifrey One has come to an end because the people who run that have decided that they can no longer run it.

541
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,100
And they're letting Showmasters events run a commercial replacement.

542
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,220
Geek Girl Con and Penguin Con have both had real problems.

543
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:07,560
Penguin Con is coming back, but Geek Girl Con still doesn't know if it's going to be able to.

544
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:15,840
And Aresia, Bay Con, Boscon, Lost Con, those are all other North American fan run conventions, all of which appear also to be struggling.

545
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,620
And I think it's worth noting that we appear to be going from that we've put the world in World Con.

546
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,580
We are now going to need the world to run all of the World Cons because it appears the US is not going to.

547
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,360
Where do we go from here?

548
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:40,100
So if we assume we can get two a decade from the UK and Ireland and we assume we can get one or two a decade from Canada, one from the Antipodes, that leaves five.

549
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,640
Where do we get the other five from?

550
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,720
That's my question.

551
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,500
Run them once every two years?

552
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,560
What, in the UK?

553
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,740
No, no, no.

554
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,480
In general.

555
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,240
In overall.

556
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,840
Stop having one every year.

557
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,200
So let it die.

558
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,300
Or begin the decline, is the answer.

559
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,780
So I think the thing we see in the UK is that World Cons have a huge effect on volunteering.

560
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:06,440
So Lung Con 3 and Glasgow 2024 both brought large numbers of volunteers and people into the community.

561
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,400
And without those events, you don't get those injections.

562
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:20,420
And I think that is a problem if we don't have as many because it means we get fewer injections of people into science fiction fandom and into con running.

563
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,140
Do we think that's probably true or do we think that's off base?

564
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:40,100
I think we've been very fortunate with the last three UK and Irish World Cons in that the way they were conceived and run was a way that encouraged and supported a lot of both volunteers and new attendees to come along.

565
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:48,280
I don't think all World Cons do that to the extent that Lung Con Dublin 2019 and Glasgow 2024 did.

566
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,860
I think they were exceptional.

567
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,120
I think 2005 did as well though, right?

568
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,500
I grant you 1980 whatever it was didn't.

569
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,000
And I don't know much about 95.

570
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,660
1987 didn't.

571
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:04,060
1987 and 1995 burnt their volunteers out.

572
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,860
But obviously both of them brought a lot of people into fandom.

573
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,460
So there's two different things.

574
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:14,080
There's bringing in new volunteers, which I think the last three conventions have been very, very good at.

575
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,760
And I think there's bringing people into fandom more generally, which I think all UK and Irish World Cons will do.

576
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,540
The number of people who worked on a convention for the first time at those three conventions was enormous.

577
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,440
And that's great.

578
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm just not sure I have that much to add on this one.

579
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,540
I don't know enough about the American scene.

580
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,000
I don't know how much like American World Cons do.

581
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,820
Is it that like every time you have a Chicago one, the same people have been running bits of Chicago ones or someone comes in at one Chicago one and then runs a big part in the next one?

582
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,920
Or is it actually completely national and people are running divisions at Seattle who ran stuff at Chicago?

583
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:01,440
Or is it actually that people are running divisions at Seattle who came in through Glasgow or who came in through London or Dublin?

584
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,740
So I don't quite know how our mix is.

585
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,980
I think the answer is, is yes.

586
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,180
I was going to say all of the above.

587
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,740
Yeah.

588
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:16,320
So like, so there are people running divisions at LA who came up through Glasgow, for instance.

589
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,580
I know this to be true.

590
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:23,760
So I think this isn't even necessarily only a question in the States, right?

591
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,720
Like, I think, I think World Con as a thing, people work on World Cons and then do work on other World Cons.

592
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,860
And it's difficult to geographically gate that.

593
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:38,040
But I also think that like, for instance, I know Glasgow social media was largely led by a team of people who were in Glasgow.

594
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:45,440
And it's difficult to imagine those people would have spontaneously volunteered if there had never been a World Con in Glasgow, you know?

595
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,340
Yeah, I think so.

596
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:52,440
But I think it's not as simple as, well, I mean, I don't think we're saying it's simple as, but I don't think it's as simple as saying, you know, there are no bids for the US.

597
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,420
So the US ones will fold and therefore the European ones will carry the torch.

598
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,440
Because I think if the US ones go away, then the European ones will also be massively affected.

599
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,380
Yes.

600
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,420
This is largely my worry.

601
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:10,360
I don't know how if you, we appear to be, and part of this is like global politics, right?

602
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:15,200
So I do understand why the US doesn't have lots of people who are eagerly proposing bids right now.

603
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,700
But at the same time, like, I do think it will be a problem for World Con more generally if all of the US World Con stop.

604
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,800
And I don't think just going to every two years will be the solution.

605
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,480
Because I think you will, you know, it's still lots of work.

606
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,580
And like, it's not just the States that's having this problem.

607
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:37,880
So since Con Zealand, New Zealand fandom seems to be having real problem with fan run conventions.

608
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,020
Finland, I saw in Smof News, which I'd missed previously.

609
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,800
So this is from a couple of months ago now.

610
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:51,300
But FinCon announced that the 2025 FinCon will not happen because no one has volunteered to run it.

611
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:59,380
And FinCon, kind of one of the reasons everyone was so excited about Helsinki was that FinCon was a really strong convention that had lots of attendees and a lot of energy.

612
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,800
So that is also interesting.

613
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:10,300
And like, anecdotally, Eastcons have been going around the same relatively small pool of people wanting to run them at a high level for a while.

614
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,420
So, yeah, I don't think this is just an American problem.

615
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,160
It's worrying.

616
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,460
Alan Fleming and David Bamford are very new.

617
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,080
Yep.

618
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,940
But I think bringing in like two new people every decade might not be a sustainable trajectory.

619
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,160
I think there's a lot of people at kind of area head level as well.

620
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,260
And not lots, but some.

621
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,640
I don't think you need a huge number.

622
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:40,020
So this is all related to the general issue that the world is having that we had that volunteering is kind of falling off a cliff edge.

623
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Because a lot of, we did, we had a huge amount of volunteering when we created a society that underemployed quite a lot of people.

624
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,360
And a lot of them did tons of volunteering in all sorts of different areas.

625
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:58,020
Those people are now aging out of volunteering.

626
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,680
And surprisingly enough, the generation below them are all working very hard.

627
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:14,720
And it's not obvious where your next batch of volunteers are coming from, which means that a lot of the things that we rely on volunteers for are just kind of going to go away.

628
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:24,400
And we'll either have to find paid models to do it or generate some new volunteers or find ways to have those things happen in a way that doesn't require volunteers to do them.

629
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,080
Make all of those things happen.

630
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,140
And for science fiction fandom in particular, UK fandom's a bit younger.

631
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:36,580
UK fandom has always been a little bit younger than the US.

632
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,240
So this is happening later in the UK.

633
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,240
But it will still happen.

634
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,960
Alison has written the cliff edge of volunteering in the show notes.

635
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,120
And this seems to be all of the references I can find by Googling or otherwise searching that are British ones.

636
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,480
So there seems to be a particular problem in Britain.

637
00:44:51,480 --> 00:45:01,100
I am not sure whether it explains what we're seeing in Finland and New Zealand and the States because I'm not Finnish or Kiwi or American.

638
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,840
But yeah, it is a problem in the UK.

639
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:13,480
Well, it's a particular problem in the UK because we run a lot of public services using volunteers, which maybe wasn't the most brilliant thing of us to do.

640
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,400
Huge chunks of the health service and social care organisations in particular.

641
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,680
I would also say we mentioned FinCon, but we don't know why FinCon isn't running.

642
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,060
It could be that they can't find a venue or their venue is super expensive or various other things.

643
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,640
It doesn't necessarily have to be lack of volunteers.

644
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,520
I would also say I'm pretty sure that...

645
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:32,920
No one bid.

646
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,680
Oh, no one bid.

647
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,200
Yeah, there was no volunteer committee.

648
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,220
But why did no one put a bid together?

649
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,680
Is it because the people who, like, had always done it, decided not to?

650
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,760
Or because...

651
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:50,220
Is it because, like we've always discussed here, there's been a shift in, you know, hotel rates and things like that that mean it's not as feasible to run the FinCon model anymore?

652
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,900
I'm just saying I would be interested to hear from someone from Finnish fandom.

653
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:02,140
I would also say I am pretty sure that in 2005 people were also going, oh, there's never any volunteers.

654
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,680
It's the death of fandom.

655
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,700
People have been worrying about the death of fandom since I joined fandom.

656
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,020
So I think...

657
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,020
And in fact, many of them thought it had already died when I joined fandom.

658
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,120
I think I was kind of the apremol and deluge person.

659
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:20,080
But in 2005, there was nowhere near the cessation of US conventions that we're seeing.

660
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:30,360
Like, the country that has largely led WorldCom running and the country that has largely led Fanrun convention running is stopping.

661
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,480
That's new.

662
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,920
As far as I can tell.

663
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,440
I don't think we've seen anywhere near the same.

664
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,580
And now we've, like, deliberately got rid of NASFIC.

665
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,560
Partly because people don't want to run NASFICs and it's just not as much of a thing.

666
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:48,960
Like, and partly because these massive professional conventions are coming in and filling that gap and are not having problems.

667
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,240
Like, there's loads of professional conventions I can go to in the UK that are, by all accounts, very, very good.

668
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,960
So I don't know.

669
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,980
I worry that this is a different sort of existential threat because it's not just the lack of volunteering.

670
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:09,640
It's the rise of events that do the same thing with less controversy and less accountability, arguably, at lower price...

671
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,420
Better marketing at lower price points with more famous people.

672
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,060
Yeah, sorry.

673
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,760
That was my point, which is I'm not arguing against John.

674
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,040
I'm arguing against Alison because I think I've heard Alison's argument many times.

675
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,980
And it has never led to, like...

676
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,480
It has never led to something like this.

677
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,320
I think there are other massive structural issues.

678
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,880
The cost of venues.

679
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:35,240
Like people not being willing to take on the risk of a failing event if you're not running a professional company.

680
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:43,040
Like the requirements that you have for running a convention now, which I would argue are, you know, there's a lot more things you have to do.

681
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,780
You have to kind of, I think, be a lot more professional to properly run a convention.

682
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:54,900
And I think that's why all these things are adding up, along with the economic situation and people not having quite as much free time.

683
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,500
I don't think it's purely a lack of volunteers, is what I'm saying.

684
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,060
It's a big multifactorial thing, but it's not purely all the young people aren't doing anything.

685
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:09,120
I looked at the FinCon statement that Smof News links to, and they basically say they think...

686
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:16,980
The statement says they think part of the problem is that Archipelicon means that they couldn't run the national convention because people were busy.

687
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,300
And so there wasn't enough people to run FinCon 2036 and FinCon 2035 and Archipelicon.

688
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:38,020
But then the problem becomes if you end up in a situation where you're forcing national fandoms to choose between running the continental world convention versus keeping their own fandoms healthy, does that in the long run bode poorly for Worldcon?

689
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,460
And I guess my real worry is that we've finally managed to make Worldcon worldwide just as it ends because the...

690
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,720
Because it's not an...

691
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,260
There are lots of people who worked on Glasgow who are American who work on Worldcons a lot.

692
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:56,860
And if those all go away, I don't know whether you can make that slack up purely nationally in each place that wants to hold a Worldcon.

693
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,480
And I worry that the answer is you can't.

694
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,700
And I might be wrong.

695
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,500
It might be great.

696
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,980
We might be going into a golden age.

697
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,120
And I'm usually the optimistic one.

698
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,120
I'm worried, though.

699
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,780
I think Worldcons might change a bit.

700
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,460
You might find somebody going, oh, I'm going to run a World...

701
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,400
Because there is no bid, we're going to run a Worldcon, but it will be smaller.

702
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,000
In the way that we did with the Eastercon in 1995, where we did piss a lot of people off.

703
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,740
But we did say we don't want to do as much work as EasterCons are.

704
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,820
And I need you to know, guys, that EasterCons were about 1% of the amount of work they are now at the time.

705
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,680
And so we're not going to do half a dozen things that the Eastercon traditionally does.

706
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,820
Because you'd rather have an Eastercon that does fewer things than not have an Eastercon.

707
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,920
And the Chester Eastercon did the same thing as well.

708
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,040
And I think you could use that model for the Worldcon.

709
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,720
Punctuation of the Worldcon.

710
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,480
We'll have an online business meeting.

711
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,980
I believe Liz once volunteered to run GlobeCon.

712
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,660
I recall that I definitely volunteered to not run GlobeCon.

713
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,780
What is GlobeCon?

714
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,420
Oh, you've forgotten the deep lore of the podcast, Alison.

715
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,700
That was like episode 10.

716
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,080
Honestly, I've forgotten what I had for breakfast and I'm still eating it.

717
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,940
We were still having this thing called a pandemic, I think.

718
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,040
And so we're talking a lot about online cons.

719
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,080
Is someone going to write in and tell me we're still having a pandemic?

720
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,000
They are, aren't they?

721
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,360
I mean, maybe.

722
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:24,240
Picks are we doing picks?

723
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,480
I'm going to pick The Tyrant Philosophers by Adrian Tchaikovsky.

724
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,220
Which, as far as I can tell, we have not previously picked on this show.

725
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,140
Which is surprising.

726
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,880
It's really good, listeners.

727
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,020
City of Last Chances and House of Open Wounds are the first two books in this sequence.

728
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,860
And then the third is Days of Shattered Faith.

729
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,640
I haven't read Days of Shattered Faith yet, but I've read the first two.

730
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,580
They are very excellent.

731
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,680
I wasn't sure how there would be a sequel to the first one.

732
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,380
And it's kind of basically set in the same world with one crossover character.

733
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,620
And it works really well.

734
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,140
The first two books are wildly different books.

735
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,840
Because the first one is basically Fantasy Casablanca.

736
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,420
And the second one is basically Fantasy MASH.

737
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,860
But they're quite different vibes.

738
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,540
He's confirmed that the fourth and fifth are coming.

739
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,580
So you should start now.

740
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,780
Otherwise, you will get behind.

741
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,820
But I think they are probably the best books he is currently writing.

742
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,540
And I think they are almost...

743
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,460
They have like shades of Pratchett to them for me.

744
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,740
And I'm really, really enjoying them.

745
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,620
So I'd highly recommend, if you haven't already heard of

746
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,040
little-known indie author Adrian Tchaikovsky,

747
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,500
I'd get on the train, listeners.

748
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,620
Choo-choo!

749
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,560
So this is what happened to me.

750
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,160
I read the first one before there was a second one.

751
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,960
I was definitely going to read the second one.

752
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,940
That was only a little while ago.

753
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,880
And now there are five.

754
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,000
Well, there's only three.

755
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,360
I mean, he's basically like Tribbles in human form.

756
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,500
There's not five yet.

757
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,360
The third one is out.

758
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,640
The fourth one, I think, is coming out next year.

759
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,240
So like, they're not...

760
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,900
It's not too rapid.

761
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,020
And there's a novella.

762
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,240
Well, yeah.

763
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,720
But novellas don't take that long to read.

764
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,400
So, okay.

765
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,200
So four and a half.

766
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,280
I'll give you four and a half.

767
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,320
The Tyrant Philosophers has had one book a year since 2023.

768
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,880
And this year's book is a novella.

769
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,900
So it's a perfect time to get caught up.

770
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,000
The next full...

771
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,420
The fourth full novel will not come out until 2026.

772
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,820
Probably about this time next year.

773
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:26,020
Can I also say that I'm looking forward to book four of the Tyrant Philosophers because

774
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,940
it's got crabs in, apparently.

775
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,240
What?

776
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,260
I did not know that.

777
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:31,960
Yeah.

778
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,000
If you look at the blurb, it says the city on the back of a crab.

779
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:41,120
So it's basically themes converging in that Adrian likes a good crab person.

780
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,840
I think this opens up an idea that the entire of the Tyrant Philosophers universe could be happening

781
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,060
on the backs of the animals that are in his other books.

782
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,260
So maybe it's the same universe, Liz.

783
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:57,340
And when you say it gives you vibes of Pratchett, there's one.

784
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,400
It does have definite Pratchett vibes.

785
00:52:59,400 --> 00:52:59,780
You're right.

786
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:07,240
They're kind of like a group of slightly misfits coming together to do things with strong philosophical

787
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,860
messages is, yeah, quite Pratchett-y.

788
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,740
But without the jokes, right?

789
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,320
No, they're very funny.

790
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,260
There are some jokes.

791
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,780
I would not say there's many jokes as there are in Pratchett.

792
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,600
They're not overt comedies, but they are funny.

793
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,180
I think Tchaikovsky is generally a funny writer.

794
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,720
Yeah, no, I mean, I found the first one pretty entertaining.

795
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,600
My pick.

796
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,140
I don't know if I've already talked.

797
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,380
I probably have already talked about the fact that I have a magic travel card that takes

798
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:36,120
me all around London for nothing, which is super amazing.

799
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,460
But one of the things I'm doing is going to bits of London that I hadn't previously been

800
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:39,680
to.

801
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:47,860
And we went to Battersea Power Station, which is one of London's two great Art Deco disused

802
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,520
power stations.

803
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,920
The first was turned into Tate Modern, I guess, 30 years ago now.

804
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,700
And the second spent a long time with people going, well, what are we going to do with it?

805
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:04,280
This is the second Pink Floyd album cover shooting location I've been to this summer.

806
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,120
I don't know why that was just random.

807
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:13,360
But I it was because I also went to the place where they shot the division bell also by accident.

808
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,860
Battersea Power Station has been turned into a giant shopping centre, which is a bit sad.

809
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,140
But I mean, it's better than it being knocked down.

810
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,800
So, you know, I think we take what we can get.

811
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,220
It's a strange sort of shopping centre because although we were there on a weekday, it is

812
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,360
enormous and it was more or less empty.

813
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,560
Most of the shops were empty.

814
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,540
There weren't that many people wandering around, but there were more people wandering around

815
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,580
than in the shops because all the shops are very expensive and nobody's got any money.

816
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:44,220
But in the they've sort of got shops in the old turbine halls and then they have a range

817
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,440
of kind of exciting things to do, which were not terribly exciting.

818
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,180
But but, you know, like expensive table tennis and that sort of thing.

819
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:58,580
And in the old control rooms, one of them is kind of a wedding venue.

820
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,780
But the other one is a cocktail bar.

821
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,940
And of course, I am.

822
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:09,700
I'm totally spoilt for cocktail bars, having been to Rattlebag, but we went to this retro

823
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,120
themed cocktail bar in the old control room.

824
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,340
So it's got all the old control dials and panels.

825
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,780
It's very exciting from the power station.

826
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:26,180
And they served us frou-frou overpriced themed cocktails that were really very good given the

827
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:26,680
location.

828
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,700
That's it, really.

829
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,840
So if you're in Battersea Power Station, you can go and have overpriced cocktails in a

830
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,100
fantastic environment.

831
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,160
And they also have an escape room, which we didn't do.

832
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,120
But people, I think it's probably very straightforward and not very good if you do that sort of thing

833
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:44,380
a lot.

834
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:50,840
And they also it also gave me a chance to go to the first time to Battersea Power Station

835
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,220
station, which is the underground station that serves Battersea Power Station.

836
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,160
And I'd wanted to do that ever since it opened.

837
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,200
So that was very exciting.

838
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,900
But it is just an underground station.

839
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,660
It's only funny because of the name.

840
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:05,780
So I have two questions for you.

841
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,080
Is this a genre pick?

842
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,800
Oh, I think it definitely is.

843
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,760
It's Battersea Power Station.

844
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,100
It's difficult to imagine a more S-Ephanol pick, really.

845
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,020
Yeah.

846
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,860
So it is, in fact, just retro.

847
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,240
What are your two questions?

848
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,840
Well, firstly, did you go up the chimney?

849
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,780
I did not because it was £22 and that seemed a lot.

850
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,620
I might another time.

851
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,600
I'm going to look out for a Groupon on the chimney.

852
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,800
That seems fair.

853
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,860
The chimney is quite good.

854
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:34,500
It does give you a quite a good view and it's quite nicely done.

855
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,640
Secondly, did you go and gawp at Apple UK?

856
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,180
The actual headquarters building?

857
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,540
No, I don't think I did.

858
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,240
Should I have?

859
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,240
Well, it's in Battersea Power Station.

860
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:50,540
So, like, it's not advertised because it's not public facing, but, like, you walk past

861
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,220
a bit and then you're like, oh, that's a lot of IMAX and a very beautifully designed lobby

862
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,260
and that is Apple's UK headquarters.

863
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,360
But the office space is largely Apple.

864
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,580
Oh, I did not spot that and I probably should have gone there.

865
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,980
If I go back, I will do that.

866
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,500
Well, if I had known you were going, I would have told you, but yeah.

867
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,460
I didn't know I was going until we basically went, oh, what else are we doing today?

868
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,080
Because that's the great thing about free travel is that you could just go and do things.

869
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:21,760
I probably will go back because on Mondays they have guided tours of the site and that

870
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,540
seemed like a thing I would like.

871
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,820
There's a little museum.

872
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,540
It's very small.

873
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,780
And we did that.

874
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:32,460
And that kind of has panels that tell you about all the very many different attempts to turn

875
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,200
Battersea Power Station into something that failed before they went up.

876
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,480
It would make a perfectly good shopping mall, which it does.

877
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:44,640
And I did go to the Apple Store, which is about twice the size and absolutely empty compared

878
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,840
to every other Apple Store I've ever been to.

879
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,000
So I think, I mean, it's not as big as, it's probably not as big as the region, as the Covent

880
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,320
Garden one, but it's just as a mall location, it's just huge and empty.

881
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,800
So if I ever need a Genius Bar appointment, I now know how to get one because the Genius

882
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,880
Bar was also empty.

883
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,340
It's unbelievable if you ever spend any time in Apple stores where there's just thousands

884
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:10,800
of people trying to work out why their phone isn't charging properly.

885
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,300
It's fluff in the charging port.

886
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,320
Yeah, compressed air.

887
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,800
Though I said that, I said that to my ex and he was like, nope, nope, my charging port isn't

888
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,880
working because I tried to clean out the fluff in the charging port and I did it in an incourious

889
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,260
way.

890
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,340
Ah, you know, that'll also do it.

891
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:30,380
Compressed air or if that fails, the toothpick from a Victronox Swiss Army knife because they're

892
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,040
made of plastic.

893
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,520
Plastic toothpick is a great shout.

894
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,120
Yes.

895
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,560
Well, I assume that's what it's for because I've never used it to pick my teeth, but I've

896
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,240
used it to get dust out of things many times.

897
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,160
Liz, what do you use to get dust out of things?

898
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,440
My phone seems to charge just fine without me ever needing to clear the dust out of it.

899
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,220
That's fair.

900
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,600
Liz doesn't have dusty pockets.

901
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,200
Turn to a pick instead of talking about apples.

902
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,020
Yes.

903
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:57,400
I haven't really been reading much or watching much for some reason.

904
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,760
I don't know what I've been doing with my life.

905
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,700
So I'm going to pick a non-genre novel because it was pretty good.

906
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,840
I'm going to pick the novel Woodworking by Emily St.

907
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:12,380
James, which is essentially the story of a trans elder called Erica.

908
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:19,600
She is recently divorced and has kind of recently not come out, but recently kind of admitted

909
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,300
to herself that she's trans.

910
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:28,000
And it's about her relationship with Abigail, a high school student who is 17 and openly out

911
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,020
and like the only trans girl in the school.

912
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,820
And it's all set in a smallish community in South Dakota.

913
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,860
And I found it really quite good.

914
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,800
I mean, it's kind of very intensely written.

915
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:45,600
It is full of kind of the different aspects and feelings and what happens when you decide

916
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,860
what path you're going to take next.

917
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,160
I really liked how it sort of inverts the relationship.

918
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:55,780
So the elder teacher is the one who's kind of coming to terms with the trans identity

919
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,360
and Abigail, the student, is the one who kind of has already done it all and is providing

920
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:00,780
advice.

921
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:05,000
And then how it interacts with the community and how it interacts with everyone in the community

922
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,500
that knows them in different ways.

923
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:11,840
You know, sometimes, well, often in not great ways because you're talking about a small community

924
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,300
in America.

925
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,040
And that's not always the friendliest place to come out, but also in kind of surprising

926
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,440
ways.

927
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,860
And yeah, I kind of liked what it did there with the relationship.

928
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,400
And I think it's a pretty good debut novel.

929
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,060
It feels a little bit fictionalized that this would actually work out okay, especially because

930
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,520
the teacher-student relationship is definitely like not an appropriate teacher-student relationship.

931
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,780
Not in the case of anything untoward happening, but in the case of you do have this inversion

932
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,880
of it's the older person really relying on the junior one for some of a kind of emotional

933
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,540
support, which is probably not the way around.

934
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,000
it should be.

935
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,840
But that aside, I really enjoyed reading it.

936
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,640
Sounds good.

937
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,920
I got Emily St. James mixed up with Emily St. John Mandel.

938
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,340
Yes, different people.

939
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:59,260
The reason I know this is for any other listeners who are like, she's Mr. Mandeloff.

940
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,540
No, listeners, you have made the same mistake as me.

941
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,860
I'm not a different person.

942
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:08,540
It's Emily St. James, who has also written some really excellent TV criticism and is a TV

943
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,960
writer on Yellow Jackets.

944
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,880
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.

945
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,280
I've put a link, I've linked the book in the show notes.

946
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,340
So, yeah, now that does sound good.

947
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,760
Yes, I didn't put it in the show notes.

948
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,480
I left it to John.

949
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,020
Thank you, John.

950
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,120
It does sound good.

951
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,220
It's worth picking up.

952
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,140
I mean, I wouldn't say I'm like, I'm mostly reading genre.

953
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,800
I'm not reading a ton of just like contemporary literature.

954
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,520
But I picked this one up based on good recommendations.

955
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,520
And yeah, I enjoyed reading it.

956
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,740
Shall we end the podcast?

957
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:36,580
Yes.

958
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,340
That was the Old Thought Podcast.

959
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,600
And it's goodbye from me.

960
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,180
It's goodbye from me.

961
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,640
And it's goodbye from me.

962
01:01:45,340 --> 01:02:14,520
Shall we talk about the Fs?

963
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,880
So last time we didn't talk about the Fs.

964
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,640
I only want to talk about one F.

965
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,080
What do you mean by the Fs?

966
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,980
The agenda items that were not ratifications.

967
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:23,660
Yeah.

968
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,420
You know, Liz, the Fs.

969
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,360
Oh, I see.

970
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,060
I forgot we didn't even get to those.

971
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:33,160
Which Fs?

972
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,220
We didn't cover everything that was in the business meeting.

973
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,580
We got fed up and didn't finish it, right?
