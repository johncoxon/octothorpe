 Claire Breyerley.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,440
 I've said it right more times than I've said it wrong now, Claire.

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,880
 So that debt is settled.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,600
 I'd like to thank Mark Plummer, Chris Garcia, Tobe Svalwell, Max Hargdon,

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,760

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,040

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,960
 and for the whole of fandom, for keeping coming up with

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,320
 interesting things for us to talk about.

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,560
 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,880
 So 19 years ago, I attended my very first WorldCon

42
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,160
 and I sat somewhere way out in the back over there.

43
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,200
 So to win in Glasgow is really special for me.

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,440
 I want to thank my family.

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,600
 I want to thank John, who came up with the idea for a podcast.

46
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,640
 I want to thank Alison, who does the art for our podcast

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,320
 every time.

48
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,360
 And I want to thank all those friends that I made in Glasgow,

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,600
 many of whom are still here with me and to thank everyone

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,880
 who couldn't be here today.

51
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,080
 And finally, I really do want to thank our listeners

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,840
 without them, they wouldn't be here tonight.

53
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,680
 Thank you.

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
 I'm Alison Scott.

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,000

66
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,440
 I've just been handed a telegram by noted member of the audience, Ian.

67
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,440
 A telegram.

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,440
 Congratulations, OctaThrop, on your huge award.

 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

71
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
 That's very, very good.

72
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,440
 Thank you for that most excellent letter of comment.

73
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
 We are not worthy.

74
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,440
 So yes, thank you.

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
 Thank you, everyone.

76
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,440
 And meaning that we have our huge awards.

77
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
 We have a shiny.

78
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
 We have a shiny.

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,440
 We now have a trophy each.

80
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,440
 Several people have asked whether we get a trophy each.

81
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
 So yes, we get a trophy each.

82
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
 They're very heavy.

83
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
 They're very beautiful.

84
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
 And I love it very much.

85
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
 Mine is in Liz's room.

86
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,440
 Liz is in the Armadillo and Alison is here.

87
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
 LAUGHTER

88
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 So Liz is on its way being shipped back to Thailand.

89
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,440
 Yes, I did not fancy carrying a large pointy metal object

90
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,440
 through several sets of airport security, basically.

91
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
 Shall we have a...

92
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,440
 OK, I want to do a quick show of hands.

93
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,440
 Who is a regular or occasional OctaThrop listener before today?

94
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
 Oh, that is most people.

95
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,440
 Has anyone just turned up because this was a room with seats in

96
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
 and it's Monday morning?

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
 Hey!

98
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,440
 You're very welcome.

99
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,440
 Has anyone never listened to our podcast?

100
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
 Oh, wow.

101
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
 Oh, wow, right.

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
 So, hello.

103
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
 I'm really sorry.

104
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
 LAUGHTER

105
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,440
 So we do a podcast is usually slightly more structured than this will be.

106
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,440
 We talk about science fiction and science fiction fandom

107
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,440
 and conventions and picks and wasps and whether or not it's dark where Liz is

108
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
 in that order.

109
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
 And it's quite good.

110
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
 And we hope you like it.

111
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
 Cricket sometimes.

112
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
 And there are many episodes.

113
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
 Please don't feel you have to start episode one.

114
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
 Please don't feel you have to listen to any of them.

115
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
 But if you would like to, we would be filled to have you.

116
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,440
 But if you're going backwards, do not listen to the immediate prior episode.

117
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
 No, whatever you do, don't start there.

118
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,440
 You start wherever you like, but don't start with episode one, one, five

119
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,440
 because it's 70 minutes about the business meeting and...

120
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
 Ooh.

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
 It was heavy.

122
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
 Oh, I was going to make the same joke I made at the fan...

123
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
 Who was at the fan fund auction?

124
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
 A few of you.

125
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
 Right.

126
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
 So I was going to say, yeah, no.

127
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
 Hello, everybody.

128
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,440
 And welcome to the overflow Wuss for Christmas meetings.

129
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
 LAUGHTER

130
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,440
 And normally at conventions when we do "Opt thought live", we pride ourselves on having more

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,440
 messages in our Discord stream than any other item at the convention.

132
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,440
 So, last time I checked, there have been 1,180 messages in the business meeting

133
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
 stream since the last time I did it.

134
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,440
 So, guys, that's your target if you are watching this on this board.

135
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
 That is free a second.

136
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
 That is going to be a challenge.

137
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,440
 Three a second, says Duncan, from the audience, which is a challenge.

138
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,440
 And I would like it to be a challenge that we do not rise to.

139
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,440
 I think we could reasonably go for, if we divide the number of messages in the business meeting

140
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
 by the number of...

141
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
 Oh, God, it's happening.

142
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,440
 For those who are not in the room, the Discord has now got a lot of gifts in.

143
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
 Are they locust?

144
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
 LAUGHTER

145
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
 So...

146
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
 LAUGHTER

147
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,440
 Anyway, this is one of the...

148
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
 No.

149
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 And guys, as you know, guys, this is great radio.

150
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
 This is great radio.

151
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
 It's all thing about it.

152
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
 Giggling.

153
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
 Top quality, top quality audio.

154
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,440
 All right, no, no, no, no, no, great, great, great, great.

155
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
 Stop.

156
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
 LAUGHTER

157
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
 Please stop.

158
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
 LAUGHTER

159
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,440
 So, I think it would be reasonable to say that if we get more than the business meeting chat

160
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,440
 divided by the number of hours of business meeting, we can consider that a normalised success.

161
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 That would only be eight messages.

162
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
 Eight?

163
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
 Yeah.

164
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
 Yeah, so we've got more than eight.

165
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
 Jobs are good.

166
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
 Right.

167
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
 Accomplished.

168
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
 Because there have been many...

169
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,440
 I just want some of the people who would like to be in this podcast and this live podcast are not here

170
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,440
 because they are at the business meeting, which continues on into infinity.

171
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
 Yes.

172
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,440
 Liz, what do you think?

173
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
 LAUGHTER

174
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,440
 Yeah, we didn't really do show notes.

175
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
 Shall we talk about the hugos a bit?

176
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
 Because they were pretty good?

177
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
 Yeah, they were pretty good.

178
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
 Yeah.

179
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
 I...

180
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
 Yeah.

181
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
 Do you want to start?

182
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
 LAUGHTER

183
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
 I was taught because I've had slightly more sleep.

184
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
 And slightly less ADHD.

185
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
 You have had approximately one hour, twenty minutes more sleep than we have.

186
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
 We did not have a lot of sleep.

187
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
 So, yes, the...

188
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,440
 When we do convention podcasts, we've got into the habit of doing them on a Monday morning

189
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,440
 and I thought, "Okay, that's only going to be great and we'll be super excited, or we really

190
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
 depress and then we can all be really depressed with you."

191
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
 But...

192
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
 Which would be great.

193
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
 It went pretty well.

194
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
 Yeah, we went a hugo.

195
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,440
 I wasn't expecting it, even though several people said, "I think you're going to win a hugo."

196
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
 We won it by a pretty narrow margin.

197
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,440
 So, thank you everyone who voted because if there's...

198
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
 It was by seven votes.

199
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
 So, if the people in this room did not vote, did we?

200
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
 We would not have won.

201
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,440
 And we all voted for ourselves, so that means it was really four.

202
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
 LAUGHTER

203
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,440
 I feel like you've forgotten Stephen and just Spaniel and Marianne.

204
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
 LAUGHTER

205
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,440
 We won by, we won by, like, minus six, and that's all.

206
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
 LAUGHTER

207
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
 We won by this podcast and their families.

208
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
 LAUGHTER

209
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,440
 And I'm not absolutely sure I voted, I'm still...

210
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,440
 I think Nicholas says he thinks I did vote this time.

211
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,440
 Commiserations to the people that we just squeaked past, which is world building for massacres.

212
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,440
 I met them this weekend, I think, for the first time, and they are absolutely lovely.

213
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
 So, you know...

214
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
 Yes.

215
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
 So...

216
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
 I wasn't listening, but I agree.

217
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
 You weren't listening.

218
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
 Oh, God, John.

219
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
 I was reading the discourse.

220
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
 LAUGHTER

221
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,440
 Is there a voice of discord in the room who's going to keep us updated with what's in the room?

222
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
 Is it?

223
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
 Yeah, everyone.

224
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
 Very...

225
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
 I'm very sorry, voice of discord.

226
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
 LAUGHTER

227
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
 Emily points out that people who came second probably have families too, and Beth points

228
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
 out that their family is very fraught with thought.

229
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
 LAUGHTER

230
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
 LAUGHTER

231
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,440
 I would like to also say thank you very much to the other finalists, all of whom make cracking

232
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,440
 vancasts and are well worth your time.

233
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,440
 It is a strong and vibrant category, and I am...

234
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,440
 I actually think it's one of the stronger categories on the ballot, because there's a lot of stuff,

235
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
 a lot of different stuff.

236
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,440
 It's highlighting a lot of good fan activity, and I'm very proud to have been recognised

237
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
 in it, because...

238
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
 Yeah.

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,440
 I think I'd agree with that.

240
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
 I mean, we've met most...

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
 You'd agree with, because...

242
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
 Yeah.

243
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
 Yeah.

244
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
 Because most of the fan casts are here, I think.

245
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
 Mmm.

246
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
 So it's been great to hang out.

247
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
 There was a podcast meetup that was just enormous.

248
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
 One of the things about...

249
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,440
 Has anyone been to a meetup this weekend?

250
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
 Did your meetup, yeah?

251
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,440
 Did your meetup fit onto the eight person meetup table that was assigned to it?

252
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 LAUGHTER

253
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,440
 Because I went to like a 70 person meetup, which was the podcast world, and I went to another

254
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,440
 70 person meetup, which wasn't even on the programme, which was the cuspus world.

255
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
 Was that just the bar?

256
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
 Oh, no.

257
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
 No, it was like...

258
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
 Well, we...

259
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,440
 They have planned to hold it in...

260
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,440
 The disused bar on the first floor of the Armadillo behind a sign saying, "Beware of the Armadillo."

261
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
 LAUGHTER

262
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,440
 But when they went there, they found a lot of security guards crawling around, so...

263
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,440
 Because it was the one nice day we've had this weekend, we all sat out on the grass, and...

264
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
 It was quite good because I got some fresh air.

265
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
 Oh!

266
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
 It's not bad.

267
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,440
 Despite the fact, I'm not in this hotel, so I'm not in the crab closet, so I had some fresh air walking to

268
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:46,440
 and from my hotel, but otherwise I've kind of been in the fetid environment of halls four and five for most of the weekend.

269
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
 And that's how the hoo-hoo's went.

270
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
 Oh, no.

271
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
 Right, I'm thinking.

272
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
 [LAUGHTER]

273
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
 The hoo-hoo's...

274
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
 I can hear his body, I forget the back.

275
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
 Hi.

276
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
 It's my name, my wife, that's her life.

277
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,440
 So, I feel like that I'm going to give some credit to this convention for supplying what they described on the

278
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
 invitation as "heavy or derve".

279
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
 Heavy or derve?

280
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
 Which we thought was going to be haggis pakora.

281
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
 Yeah, it was.

282
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
 I was quite... I was so glad.

283
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 It was just...

284
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
 It was dinner.

285
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
 It was dinner.

286
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
 It was just a buffet.

287
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
 It was actual food.

288
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
 Yeah.

289
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
 It was like...

290
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
 Hot food and vegetables.

291
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,440
 And they had the most Scottish of drinks, biramaretti, which, when I think Scotland, I think, biramaretti.

292
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,440
 And then I also want to thank Seattle for doing a really nice after party.

293
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
 And they gave us a lovely little gift.

294
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
 And it happened to me...

295
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
 So good.

296
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
 I'm so happy.

297
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
 If you'd said to me, I didn't bring it on Fred.

298
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,440
 If you'd said to me, "What gift will Seattle welcome gift to the Hugo Funnelies?"

299
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
 I'd have gone, "I don't know."

300
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,440
 And then I got it and it was an espresso cup and I was like, "Oh!"

301
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
 With a tiny sashay, you have sofied themed coffee.

302
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
 And I got so excited.

303
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
 And I took two, one for me and one for EspaÃ±a.

304
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,440
 And then I realized that I was supposed to queue up and let them rewrite my name down.

305
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
 And I had not done that bit.

306
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
 So, you're the third one.

307
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
 No, I've only got two.

308
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
 I'm not.

309
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
 I didn't steal anything.

310
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
 I could have got one for Steven.

311
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,440
 I kind of started in on this, "Oh, I've been on the finalist from two different categories.

312
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,440
 Can I have two espresso cups so that me and my husband can have espresso cups?"

313
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,440
 And then we remember we do not use espresso cups.

314
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
 We just got rid of eight.

315
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:23,440
 We looked at my parents beautiful China espresso cups and said, "So, these are for when you serve coffee."

316
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,440
 None of these have Seattle World Con branding as well.

317
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,440
 When are we going to drink tiny coffee and tiny cups after dinner?

318
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
 What you do is...

319
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
 No, when you watch the...

320
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,440
 Right, so if you ever watch the Ant Man films, have an espresso, you can feel like you're

321
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
 a giant man drinking a tiny coffee.

322
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
 It's great.

323
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,440
 Every time we watch the Ant Man movies, we have espresso.

324
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
 Thematic.

325
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
 Or a sports direct mug.

326
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,440
 It works in either direction.

327
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
 So anyway, so...

328
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
 The Hugo.

329
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
 Yeah.

330
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
 I mean, I thought it was a really good ceremony.

331
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,440
 I'm quite glad it started late because I sent my family stream and I think if it hadn't been

332
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
 late, they would have missed it.

333
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
 So, I forgot to tell them what time it started.

334
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
 So that was good.

335
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,440
 It's really weird because I'm very glad that we are early in the ceremony because I don't

336
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
 think I really want...

337
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
 You're getting a little bit nervous, a little bit nervous, a little bit more nervous.

338
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
 And then you kind of like...

339
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,440
 It gets your moment and you have like the maximum nervousness.

340
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
 And then, you know, in previous years, like, "Oh, we didn't win.

341
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
 Okay, I can now enjoy the ceremony."

342
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
 But I'm very glad we're first.

343
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,440
 Oh, it did mean I sort of sat there hugging a Hugo for two hours.

344
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
 It was...

345
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,440
 I want to say about the ceremony, John Scalzi's speech was amazing.

346
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
 It was really, really good.

347
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
 And I just...

348
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
 I think he really nailed that.

349
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,440
 Obviously, "T" Kingfisher's speech was brilliant.

350
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,440
 Like, I always like when she wins when they win because firstly, they're very good.

351
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
 And secondly, the speech is so good.

352
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,440
 And then Emily Tesh's speech, which she wrote in the audience of the ceremony.

353
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,440
 And if that's true, she is annoyingly talented.

354
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
 But it was so good.

355
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,440
 It was so powerful and I liked it a great deal.

356
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,440
 And then we did a speech which had a funny bit at the beginning, which Liz asked when we were on our way over.

357
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
 "John, do we have to do the funny bit at the beginning?"

358
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
 And I was like, "You Liz? Yes, we do."

359
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,440
 I thought we might do it wrong and then it would fall very flat and then everyone would just be staring at us.

360
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
 But...

361
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,440
 Actually, the lights are so bright you can't really see anyone in the audience.

362
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
 So, I think that is helpful to me.

363
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,440
 I feel like enough people in the audience got magic.

364
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,440
 Yeah, well, because we won and that means at least like seven people listen.

365
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:41,440
 The other thing about the Seattle after party is that they served us more beer, which was good.

366
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,440
 So there was actually plenty of alcohol at both the pre...

367
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,440
 There wasn't plenty afterwards, but that was only because we'd have...

368
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
 It doesn't matter how much they had provided.

369
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
 We would...

370
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,440
 The Hugo Finalist would continue drinking until all the alcohol was gone even...

371
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,440
 But there was a reasonable amount of alcohol I applied to.

372
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,440
 I didn't feel short-changed and that is the first time that's happened at a Hugo Finalist party I've been at.

373
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,440
 But at the end, the room was emptying out and all the alcohol was gone.

374
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,440
 And then there was this huge, almost untouched sandwich buffet.

375
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,440
 Yeah, yeah, because they'd served us dinner before and then there were sandwiches after.

376
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,440
 Which was very lovely, but I didn't need a lot of sandwiches on account of how I just had dinner.

377
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,440
 John, is it possible that many Hugo Finalists are a bit nervous and don't want to fill their boots at the buffet?

378
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,440
 Oh yeah, well, you'd think, but if it was nearly untouched after, maybe, I don't know.

379
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,440
 No, no, no. I don't think it was untouched. I think it was just enormous.

380
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,440
 So I think if they served a third as much sandwiches and used the extra money to buy beer...

381
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,440
 I think they should have used the extra money to buy a wider variety of soft drinks.

382
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,440
 Because one of the things that got mentioned in the Hugo Finalist Discord afterwards was that a couple of people who don't drink and they were like,

383
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
 "Well, I had water until the water ran out."

384
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,440
 And that is awkward because why did they not have iron brew?

385
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
 Like, literally why?

386
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,440
 Somebody did say...

387
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,440
 Somebody did actually, maybe it was a Spaniard.

388
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:13,440
 I feel like somebody essentially told the conference centre that not serving water was a kind of fundamental violation.

389
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
 They should get their act together.

390
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
 And they did it.

391
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,440
 I mean, I don't know if it was, she's not saying yes.

392
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
 So I think...

393
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
 She said no.

394
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,440
 She said it, but she didn't say it to the convention centre because she was a coward.

395
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
 She's so not a coward.

396
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
 Well, I'm reporting her words.

397
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
 I didn't make those words up.

398
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,440
 So this is from the least cowardly person I've ever met in my entire life.

399
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,440
 I mean, yep.

400
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:44,440
 It is fair to say that there are a preponderance of opinionated women in my life.

401
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
 And that might not be an accident.

402
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
 Hello, John.

403
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
 Hello, Liz.

404
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
 Hello, John.

405
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
 Hello, Alison.

406
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,440
 So yeah, the actual ceremony, it's very nerve-wracking when you're listening to the thing.

407
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,440
 And then they said the thing and then sort of everything goes weird.

408
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
 It does.

409
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,440
 And the three, the experiences I think it's most similar to are my PhD driver and when I got

410
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
 married.

411
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:16,200
 The experience of wandering around a hotel bemucidly, clutching a thing, while everyone

412
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,040
 takes photos of you, congratulates you and distracts you from getting anything to eat,

413
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,640
 is very much like the experience of being in a wedding reception when you've just been

414
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
 married.

415
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,920
 And it was very lovely.

416
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
 And I took photos with lots of people.

417
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,880
 I believe there is a photo of Emily Inkpen doing something ill-advised with my Hugo.

418
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,880
 And I'm really hoping I get a copy of that photo because it may be a lot.

419
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
 What's she looking at?

420
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,080
 I have no further comments at this time.

421
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,600
 I went to John's wedding reception and by the end of it he'd taken his tie off and it

422
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
 was tied around his head.

423
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,680
 So I think maybe a wedding reception was slightly, slightly higher in the category.

424
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,240
 Emily's fortune in the chat has said there was so much buffet, you could see it from

425
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,880
 the massive, behind the massive barrier that separated the Hugo finalist reception from

426
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,320
 the hyperloin in the main hall.

427
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,480
 Which in a smuggled you all sandwiches.

428
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,800
 Nula says in the chat, "I met Octo Thorpe at a charity do once.

429
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,440
 They were surprisingly down to earth and very funny."

430
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
 [laughter]

431
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,080
 I had tickles me, I don't know.

432
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
 I'm just like that.

433
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,240
 Yeah, and we have ribbons.

434
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,400
 If you want a ribbon come and get a ribbon.

435
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,280
 Yeah, we should have said earlier, if you don't aren't already wearing an Octo Thorpe

436
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,000
 ribbon and you would like one we have ribbons, I think we've probably got enough for all

437
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,280
 of you who don't already have one.

438
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
 We don't have enough Hugo's to go round unfortunately.

439
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,840
 So, so, so, Pat Montgomery texted me, and he said, "Congratulations," and I said, "Thank

440
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 you," and he said, "This is your second, isn't it?"

441
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
 And I don't expect...

442
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,600
 Sorry, I know the joke, but this is very good.

443
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,960
 And I don't expect people to know how many Hugo's I thought, "Oh, you know, I expect

444
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,480
 me to remember, but I have one, three, yes."

445
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,160
 But the thing that's interesting about this is that the second Hugo I won at LACom and

446
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,640
 the person who was my designated acceptor was Pat Montgomery.

447
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,640
 Yes.

448
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,640
 That's why it's funny Pat can't remember your run to do because he accepted one.

449
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,120
 So of all the people in the world who aren't you, he should know.

450
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,680
 Other things about the Hugo's, they had a few glitches in the ceremony and it was quite

451
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
 funny.

452
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,920
 I think it is a testament to how good a job the Glasgow team have done, but especially

453
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,720
 Meg Mcdonald, the Division Head of Promotions, that the amount of warmth and goodwill in the

454
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,160
 room while that was happening, people were laughing, they were cheering, they were clapping.

455
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,920
 That was a very happy room, celebrating a thing that everyone was there to have a nice time

456
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,000
 to celebrate this convention, which has been wonderful, and everyone was just behind the

457
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 convention in that moment.

458
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,520
 And I was like, "This is lovely."

459
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,640
 And then an astronaut fixed it, which is the exact skill set.

460
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,840
 Like astronauts are hired to be able to take things going wrong and very quickly identify

461
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,560
 how to fix them and then do it.

462
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,400
 And it is not a surprise that the person who did that in the room was the astronaut,

463
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,280
 because that is what you, that is what they are selected for.

464
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,040
 My favourite line of the whole ceremony was, "And the winner is Octa Thorpe."

465
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,840
 No, my second thing.

466
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,920
 My second thing.

467
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,560
 Sorry, I like that one.

468
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,160
 Sorry, the case is a really massive thing.

469
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
 I'm sorry, I'm collapsing.

470
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,120
 My second favourite line of the whole ceremony was, "Oh, I tell you the winner, but I don't

471
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
 have an envelope."

472
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,960
 And everyone thought, "I'll read it off the hugo."

473
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,160
 Yes, that was so good.

474
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,280
 She was just like, "How do we...

475
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
 That's the thing."

476
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,480
 Quickly identifying problems and solutions.

477
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,680
 Because obviously, if you do it at the hugo ceremony, you just cover over a small period

478
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
 of embarrassment.

479
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,880
 And if you do it in space, you're not dead.

480
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,240
 And you don't.

481
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,480
 I did think that they got the tone right for the hugos, because they had this really

482
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,800
 horrible thing of like, "How do I acknowledge what happened last year that's probably going

483
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,640
 to come up in some speeches?

484
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,520
 How do we kind of deal with all this?"

485
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,200
 And so I thought, one, getting John Scalzi to explain the hugos to everyone, it's great.

486
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,160
 There's lots of first world comp people here who are like, "Why are they called the hugos?

487
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,800
 Why are they so pointy?

488
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,200
 Why are they so complicated?

489
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
 Who gets to vote?

490
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
 How do we decide?"

491
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,440
 Yes, and so I thought they did that really well with Scalzi.

492
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,520
 And also I thought the nominies, the finalists and winners who had been effect in the previous

493
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,600
 year, who mentioned it in their speeches, I thought struck a really good tone of, "We

494
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,400
 want to celebrate this year, but also acknowledge what happened last year."

495
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,080
 I think they realised that Glasgow, Glasgow are trying their hardest to make it all work.

496
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
 And so I thought that was good.

497
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,800
 Because it could have been a ceremony where there were some real downers.

498
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,920
 Like if someone got up and was basically like, "Yeah, this is the hugo eye."

499
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,240
 It could be like feeling like this is the one I deserved because last year took it away

500
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,240
 from me.

501
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,160
 But I thought it was just nice.

502
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,040
 It's even very nice in the audience, but also I was sitting directly behind Naomi Gritza,

503
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
 so she was having a good time.

504
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
 She had a good night.

505
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,200
 Roshi Chen, who won for Best Editor, and that should have been included.

506
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,240
 Emily Tesh was going to win for Best Novel, but I did not put it together until Emily

507
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
 Tesh won for Best Novel.

508
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,320
 And then I was like, "Yes!"

509
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,200
 So if you are listening, if you are watching on replay, if you can hear someone shout, "Yeah!"

510
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,560
 as she goes up, "That is me, I was very excited."

511
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,720
 You were very excited.

512
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
 Well I was very worried it wouldn't be her.

513
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,680
 And I'm very glad it was her, because I think her book was the best book.

514
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,760
 As discussed on previous episodes.

515
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,720
 And I thought it was the second best book, but the book I thought was the second.

516
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
 It came fifth.

517
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,480
 So, you know.

518
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,040
 I think it's a very good thing for the genre that St.

519
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,400
 Abright Doors has won an Nebula, and some Desperate Glory has won a Hugo, because if

520
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,680
 those are the two books that Science Fiction Community have decided are the two books to

521
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,520
 recognise this year, that's pretty damn good for the state of the genre.

522
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,120
 Those are two incredibly accomplished books.

523
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
 What on the clock?

524
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,440
 In Ascension by Marge McInnes, which I picked on OctoThorpe some months ago.

525
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,880
 Liz is the tastemaker, but not the taskmaster.

526
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,480
 I'm sorry for people who misread the episode title and thought we were going to do a task

527
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
master episode.

528
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
 No.

529
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
 No.

530
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,600
 We're not funny enough for that.

531
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,840
 Alex Horn's very good, and we're fine.

532
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,080
 Who else won?

533
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,560
 Strange Horizons.

534
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
 Bloody brilliant.

535
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,000
 About fucking time.

536
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,560
 They, yes, very happy with that as well.

537
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,840
 And also, yeah, I was talking to some of them, and one of them basically came to their first

538
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,760
 world con on one of Hugo, and I was like, it doesn't, it's not always like this.

539
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
 Yeah.

540
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,920
 Because my first world con I presented at Hugo, and then the last, and then the time after

541
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,880
 that I was on stage was yesterday.

542
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,240
 So that's like in a 13 year gap.

543
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,120
 Yeah, but it was very good.

544
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,960
 And I got to say Claire Pirely's name right.

545
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
 On stage.

546
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
 About time.

547
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
 About time.

548
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
 Of course.

549
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
 Of course.

550
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,920
 A lie, you've let a roof comment.

551
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,800
 Please wait for the microphone to reach you before making it.

552
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,760
 We do have a roving mic, that's good.

553
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,600
 We do.

554
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,320
 And when should we open it to questions?

555
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,640
 Do we have anything else we want to say?

556
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,320
 I think, do we want to say other things about the convention as well as about the hugas?

557
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,800
 It bloody good, wouldn't it?

558
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,240
 This is the best world con I've been to.

559
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,240
 I think it's probably a very good world con, and I'm looking forward to attending it over

560
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,800
 the next four months on replay.

561
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,520
 I will say, I don't know if we're going to do picks, but my pick is a panel.

562
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
 Sorry.

563
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,120
 And it's a panel that's not on replay, so I'm really sorry.

564
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,520
 So I spent the weekend mostly, I've been doing the fanfans, and I've been doing a lot of

565
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,120
 work for it, and fanfans is not great work, and I've been very tired, and every time I

566
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,200
 get, ah, this is so, this is so hard, ah, I'm so fed up doing fanfans, and then I go,

567
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,360
 they gave you a five week trip to Australia and New Zealand, and you can stop complaining

568
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
 now, girls.

569
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,800
 So, you know, so I'm going to be doing fanfans for a while.

570
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 They gave me a wife.

571
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 Oh, yeah.

572
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,560
 Oh, I feel, I feel hard done by it, because I could do with a wife, because I have this

573
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
 in this.

574
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,040
 Oh, I don't know.

575
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
 I think any spouse could handle that.

576
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,560
 The opinion of the author podcast is that any spouse could deal with this issue.

577
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,400
 It's the only room I can blame.

578
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,800
 Or might not, I don't know.

579
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,800
 I mean, is it that you want a wife or just that you want an extra person to clean your

580
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
 house?

581
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,200
 Have you considered hiring a cleaner?

582
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
 It's complicated.

583
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,040
 I have a complicated relationship with professional staff in my house.

584
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,720
 I mean, I was going to say, have you considered polyamory?

585
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,640
 There are always two solutions to every question.

586
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,520
 One is capitalism, and the other is polyamory.

587
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
 My husband's...

588
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,560
 I don't think my husband's in the room.

589
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
 Stephen?

590
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
 Yes.

591
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,440
 But I do think my ex-husband's in that room.

592
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
 Wow.

593
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
 Wow.

594
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
 That, that.

595
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
 Well, wow.

596
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
 Wow.

597
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
 So, so...

598
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
 Oh.

599
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,320
 We were talking yesterday on one of the... maybe in the podcast meetup about how much of your

600
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,480
 personal life you expose on the podcast, but I'm kind of like polyamory being there

601
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
 done that.

602
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
 Got the ex-husband.

603
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
 Oh.

604
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,520
 Shall we talk about the interview?

605
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,200
 We were interviewed by someone, and I don't know who they were.

606
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
 Go radio.

607
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,520
 There were apparently a local Glasgow radio station, and they did videos and bits that

608
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,600
 might put on their socials and stuff.

609
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,160
 Yeah, it was kind of social video.

610
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,920
 And Meg pulled us... we were just being taken off stage at the end of the thing after the

611
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,960
 winner's photo, and Meg was like, you'll be great for these guys.

612
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,920
 Stand there, do whatever they say.

613
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,600
 They asked Ken Maclellan to move out of the way, because he was in the video, and I was

614
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,440
 a bit like, oh no.

615
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
 So, that was kind of...

616
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,320
 Sorry, sorry Ken, if you're listening.

617
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,760
 Back to the video blog, which we were talking about.

618
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,160
 So they got us up, and they asked us some questions, which were kind of the sort of questions

619
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
 you'd expect.

620
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,840
 And then they asked what we really liked about Glasgow, and I was like, oh, I know what I'm

621
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,000
 going to say here.

622
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And John said...

623
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,400
 I've really enjoyed the food, and I think Glasgow has a very vibrant food culture.

624
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
 Yay!

625
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,400
 And then Alison said, you swine, you were swine.

626
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,400
 You snuck to me, because I was going to say how much I liked Glasgow's vibrant food culture.

627
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,040
 I mean, I have had some great food.

628
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,680
 I mean, I've also eaten in the Crown Plaza, but I've eaten some great food.

629
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,560
 I haven't got off-site very much, because fanfums is fine.

630
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,960
 I had some fabulous meals in Australia.

631
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,880
 We had dinner with the eminent Claire Briarley and the eminent Mark Plummer on A Night, I

632
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
 forget which.

633
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,400
 And they said, I was having a rest of the day, and I'm assuming you're very busy and too

634
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,000
 busy to have dinner with the likes of us.

635
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,320
 But if you are not, we would love to get dinner with you.

636
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
 And then they said, oh, we'd love to have dinner.

637
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,880
 I've been prioritising seeing people and spending time with people who I do not see all the time.

638
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,680
 So I love Claire Briarley and I love Mark Plummer, but I do, in fact, see them.

639
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,840
 No, I know you're very lucky, but I've been having breakfast with Liz a lot, because she

640
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,000
 lives in Thailand, which is ages away.

641
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,480
 And I was glad to see Mark and Claire, because they live in Croydon, which is ages away.

642
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,600
 You have to like, you get to King's Cross and you're not there yet.

643
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
 It's very strange.

644
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
 Um, but yes.

645
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
 Um...

646
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
 So that was you, guys.

647
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,520
 So that's everything about the Hugo's in a consolce and structured way.

648
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
 But we're talking about the convention.

649
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
 Great.

650
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,920
 Oh, we did the fanfons auction.

651
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,800
 How many people have donated something to the fanfons this weekend?

652
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
 Right.

653
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,640
 How many people haven't donated something to the fanfons weekend?

654
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,120
 You've still got about four hours.

655
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
 We'll take the clothes off your pants.

656
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,760
 Get down to the tables or, you know, just come and push cash on me.

657
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
 Um, fanfons are great.

658
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,040
 We did a live auction and we raised Â£4,400.

659
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:31,560
 Â£4,420 and Â£20, that last Â£20 being the Battlestar Galactica calendar that Caroline

660
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,760
 had lovingly kept since 1987, which, which Justin's tore up.

661
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
 So we...

662
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
 So that's some kind of...

663
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,480
 I came in to, for the...

664
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,400
 There were a set of Piercon dice, which were incredibly useful.

665
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,280
 And I came in and the first bid was 50 quid and I was like, nope.

666
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,880
 I don't need more dice, but I especially don't need dice that eventually go for triple digits.

667
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,520
 I have said to multiple dice makers, oh, you know, there's something about dice in

668
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,960
 conventional auctions.

669
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,560
 If you give us unique dice, people paid too much.

670
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:08,240
 We had three Glasgow 2024 dice from a limited edition of six and they went for Â£45, Â£55 and Â£60.

671
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,200
 My Glasgow in 2024 was bought for me by one, Esther McCallum Stewart, because she bid me

672
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
 up.

673
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,920
 I think it was the East Confan Fund auction and she bid up the James Shields donated some

674
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
 dice.

675
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,440
 She bid against me until the price was like Â£150 quid and then she was like, I'll send

676
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,600
 them to your job, what's your address?

677
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,360
 She is a lovely person.

678
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,760
 She is a lovely person.

679
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,400
 So, yeah, no, this...

680
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,320
 Oh, that's one of my highlights.

681
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,880
 No, I'm not too young to know who Taggot is.

682
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
 Sorry.

683
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:43,360
 That's why one of the prizes in the scavenger hunt you had to find a murder because of Taggot.

684
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,520
 They were all Scotland references, some more obscure than others.

685
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,720
 Oh, I'm sorry for putting toy money in, but come on.

686
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,600
 So the scavenger hunt came out and I'm not easily distractable.

687
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,080
 As evidenced by the fact that despite the fact that I had many other things to do, from

688
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,640
 the moment I worked out where the scavenger hunt was, which did take me some time because

689
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,640
 it was hidden in John's entry in the members' directory.

690
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,040
 I went back and edited my introduction post, yeah.

691
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,640
 Honestly, though, if you search for scavenger hunt, it appeared.

692
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,720
 And Alison was like, I don't know where it is, where is it?

693
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
 Where's the scavenger hunt?

694
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
 I'm like...

695
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,080
 I refused to give anyone too many hints because I was like, once you get it, it's very obvious.

696
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
 I didn't...

697
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
 I didn't feel...

698
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,640
 It took me about two hours and I felt very stupid for about what I don't...

699
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
 For about two more hours.

700
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
 How's the scavenger hunt?

701
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,760
 So I then spent about the next 36 hours doing the scavenger hunt and not really doing anything

702
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
 else.

703
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,320
 So I discovered the fabulous Easter egg at the scavenger hunt, which was the Tifbunch you

704
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,560
 got everything you had 20, 24 points.

705
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
 Yeah.

706
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
 I'm not an idiot.

707
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,200
 I mean, I am, but not with numbers.

708
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,700
 Well, I mean, I am.

709
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,600
 So, and I made an armadillo with a traffic cone on its head out of Fimo for the scavenger hunt.

710
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,520
 And then I was like, oh, this came out quite well.

711
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,960
 So I baked it into the...

712
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,360
 But when I made it, it had little armadillo markings all along the side, but it only had

713
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,240
 them on the front because I knew I was only using it for a folks' bit.

714
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,360
 So once I decided to keep it, I had to turn it round and put the markings on the back as

715
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,760
 well before I found it.

716
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,960
 So I wasted a little more time.

717
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
 And...

718
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,040
 And also, a lot of people came up to me through the con and said it had really helped them

719
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,040
 like feel good about meeting other people and stuff.

720
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,480
 And that was kind of what we were going for.

721
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,440
 So yeah, I'm really happy.

722
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,960
 Well, John did two games.

723
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,400
 And the one game was the scavenger hunt.

724
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:29,240
 The other game John did was if I ran the zoo, if I ran the con, and which is the NESF

725
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,680
 for con running game, which we did as a former episode of Octthorp.

726
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,640
 And he wasn't at all sure how it would go.

727
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,320
 How did it go, John?

728
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:46,120
 So I have a sticker on my badge, which says, "Secret Masters of Random, hashtag Fran was

729
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
 right."

730
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,960
 And I found these stickers outside the Argyle Suite, and I nearly cried.

731
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,960
 And part of that was because I'd been spending some time with Joe Playford, and if you know

732
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,640
 you know, and part of that was because it was just very touching to know that I'd run

733
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,440
 this game and it evolved like little culture and people were having very detailed discussions

734
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,280
 about con running, but they were thinking they were playing a game.

735
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,880
 And also like, and there was a character called Fran in the game, and the person, I need to

736
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,080
 send a message to the person who wrote that scenario.

737
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,440
 But I think giving you a person.

738
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,680
 A lot of the scenarios are written very, there's no characters, but I think the fact that everyone

739
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,000
 latched on to Fran is a sign that if they ever do a fifth edition, I think putting some

740
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,560
 more named fans in other scenarios might help people get into it.

741
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,560
 But yeah, like we had 100 odd people voting in the polls and arguing about whether or

742
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,000
 not we should tell the hotel about our ton of ice.

743
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,240
 So it was fun.

744
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,520
 And also, yeah, a friend of mine was like, "Well, do you know what these stickers are

745
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
 about?

746
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
 Because I'm confused."

747
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
 And I was like, "Yes, I do."

748
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
 And they were like, "Why?"

749
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
 And I was like, "Because I ran a game."

750
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
 And they were like, "Oh."

751
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
 And yeah.

752
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
 So the stickers were based on the ricks.

753
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,440
 I've been doing some virtual rippons, but not as many as I would like because...

754
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
 I guess you've been busy.

755
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
 Yeah, because I've been busy.

756
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,000
 I did say I probably wasn't going to do quite a minute because I can only do the stickers

757
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,640
 on the laptop and I pranked my legs so I can't carry the laptop.

758
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
 So that, but you know.

759
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,040
 Liz, what do you think?

760
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,160
 I mean, I think I have more thoughts on the Discord when I've had more than five and a

761
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,720
 half hours sleep.

762
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,360
 But I think that was definitely a case of the Discord.

763
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,960
 The Discord for this convention is massive.

764
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,520
 I mean, I think like the number of program items exceeds the number of threads we're

765
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,480
 allowed to have or something ridiculous like that.

766
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
 Yeah, we are.

767
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,080
 We are pushing up against some technical limitations annoyingly.

768
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,520
 And so it was definitely people finding like a little corner where they could find their

769
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,920
 tribe and I'm so happy that they found their little corner and made in jokes and stickers

770
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,320
 and everything because otherwise you could look at the Discord and be like, nope, 5,000

771
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,720
 channels, I'm off out.

772
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,400
 And so I think that worked really, really well.

773
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,640
 Probably better than when we did it as a podcast, to be honest.

774
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,640
 Yeah, maybe.

775
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
 Dokes for funnier.

776
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,480
 And we're going to make Esther play it so that she can see whether she gets a better

777
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
 score than the accumulated wisdom of the guys who are all gone.

778
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,960
 When are you making Esther play it?

779
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
 I don't know.

780
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,720
 She's been quite busy and we haven't had time to sit down and compare diaries.

781
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,840
 So one of my other convention highlights was that I met Esther's mum who has been at

782
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,200
 the conventional weekend.

783
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,480
 So we were kind of like, oh, we are not worthy again because Esther seems to have come out

784
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,960
 quite well as a person.

785
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
 So that was very nice.

786
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,360
 So I think it's quite nice bringing your mum to the con.

787
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
 Yeah.

788
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,320
 So, so Adri's parents were in the audience to see him.

789
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:30,920
 Yeah, my dad found out I wanted Hugo at, hang on, I've got a timestamp, 1110 today.

790
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,960
 Because I'm good at communicating.

791
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,520
 Your dad's having a good Monday then.

792
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
 Yeah.

793
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
 He's retired.

794
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,000
 All Mondays are good Mondays for him.

795
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Yeah.

796
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,440
 I just, I have actually met John's parents.

797
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
 So, yeah.

798
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
 Yeah.

799
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
 Mm.

800
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
 Why?

801
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
 On holiday, John.

802
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
 Oh, yeah.

803
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
 Yeah.

804
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
 Yeah.

805
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
 Liz was on holiday in the same place.

806
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,880
 We were on holiday and so we hung out for a bit and it was great.

807
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
 Hmm.

808
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
 Sorry.

809
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
 That was an interesting anecdote.

810
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
 It was just a nice time.

811
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
 This is an eye-hat.

812
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,680
 And but Alison's going to go to LA con and we can show Alison Galaxy's edge.

813
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
 She's promised.

814
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,720
 She looked in the, dead in the eyes of John, I promise I'm coming to LA con.

815
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,800
 I'm pretty sure I didn't say that.

816
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,040
 So one of the things about this is that we might go to see, Stephen wants to go, might

817
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,720
 go to Seattle as, see it.

818
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,360
 Oh, it's complicated.

819
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:22,440
 Anyway, last after ChaiCon, Liz and John went to Disney to Orlando, yeah?

820
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,760
 Yeah, it was before, but yeah.

821
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,280
 But anyway, so I didn't do that and then they sent a lot of photos of them at Galaxy's

822
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,080
 edge and I was like, got a bit of foam over here.

823
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,640
 Just a little bit and, you know, could have done that maybe.

824
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,600
 And so after, and John was like, well, there'll be another LA con quite soon when there is.

825
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,120
 You can come to Orlando and we'll show you.

826
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,680
 No, well, there's also a Galaxy's edge in California.

827
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
 Yeah.

828
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,160
 Come to Anaheim, we'll show you Galaxy's edge and I'm very looking forward to that.

829
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,320
 So that's a plan.

830
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,040
 And then they announced when they announced LA con yesterday morning.

831
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,080
 Yes, the guests of honor are great.

832
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
 Yeah.

833
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,600
 I'll probably talk about the guests of honor, but I'm only going to talk about one right

834
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,400
 now, which is that the fan guest of honor is Jerry Sullivan, who had just got COVID

835
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
 at the point.

836
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,440
 So she wasn't in the room for them to say and we like to introduce Jerry Sullivan, but

837
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,920
 there was apparently a very big cheer in the business meeting when Jerry's name was announced,

838
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
 which is quite nice.

839
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
 They are all their guests are good.

840
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,240
 Do you want to read the map properly, John?

841
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
 Come on.

842
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,640
 I was going to talk about the LA con guests.

843
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
 I mean, I'm not going to, they're so, I have three.

844
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,320
 Three, I think they're very exciting.

845
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,880
 They have Ronald D. Moore of Bathstyle Electica for All Mankind, Deep Space Nine.

846
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,200
 Like that is really like what you can do, I guess, when you're in LA.

847
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,320
 So I think that's really cool.

848
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,560
 They have Stan Sakai of U Sanji, your jimbo.

849
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
 And they have Tim Kirk.

850
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,400
 And I was a little bit confused because I think there's also a Tim Kirk in UK fandom.

851
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
 There are two of them.

852
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,680
 I thought it was like, which Tim Kirk is it?

853
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,840
 There are two in UK fandom.

854
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
 Yeah.

855
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
 And it's under those.

856
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,480
 It's not to be a Tim Kirk who has previously won Hugo's for art, but is also a Disney

857
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
 Imagineer who made Tokyo Disney seat.

858
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,120
 So I am personally very excited about all these people.

859
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:10,200
 Barbara Hambley, Colleen Duran, Anita, Sen Gupta are the three we haven't mentioned and

860
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,560
 the Toastmaster will be a Syla Benin, which is also a very good pick.

861
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,000
 Especially because it means she's going to get to more.

862
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,920
 Man, it's just going to be different sea creatures like for every category, isn't it?

863
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,480
 I mean, I met Sue Mason in 1984, one of my oldest and dearest friends and approximately

864
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,600
 two minutes after we met, she said Colleen Duran is the best illustrator working in the

865
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
 world.

866
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
 She is my favourite illustrator.

867
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,880
 So I am delighted that only 40 some odd years later she's getting to be a guest of

868
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,360
 an honor at a world con.

869
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,720
 It's like, I feel like she's quite a niche interest.

870
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,760
 And we were talking, we were talking, I can't remember if we, I sometimes get confused

871
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,320
 between conversations I've had on the podcasting, just conversations I've had.

872
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,800
 So like apologies, I don't remember if this was an episode.

873
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,800
 We were discussing when Gerry Anderson was a guest of honor at a world con.

874
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,000
 And we're going through the list of guests of honor and there really aren't many that

875
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,600
 have worked in media, which obviously reflects the interest of the world con.

876
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
 I think it's great.

877
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,840
 But like I do think, you know, especially now the quality of science fiction in movies

878
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,880
 and TV over the last decade has just, I mean, it's insane.

879
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,200
 Like, you, for mankind is absolutely amazing.

880
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,440
 And the fact that like it's up there with like severance and and or another great science

881
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,480
 fiction that's on the screen.

882
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,440
 And I do think Ronald D. Moore is exactly the sort of person where it's like, he's done

883
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
 thoughtful science fiction.

884
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,600
 He's done a lot of it.

885
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,200
 He will be fascinating to see on panels.

886
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,920
 And obviously it ties in with Hollywood and the fact that we're not sandalies.

887
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
 But I just I really like that they have him as a as a guest.

888
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,400
 I think it's really good as well as people from the more literary tradition of the world

889
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
 con.

890
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
 I think it's a great roster.

891
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,040
 I'm very excited about LA.

892
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,000
 I mean, my sister in Nolibs is Santa Monica.

893
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,680
 So we will definitely be going because because it's good excuse to hang out with her as well.

894
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,600
 I missed Spanish yesterday as we usually do Spanish at half five on a Saturday, but yeah,

895
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,000
 I was busy yesterday or Sunday.

896
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Oh shit.

897
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,720
 Well, OK, I've lost a day.

898
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,320
 That's awkward, isn't it?

899
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,760
 Well, oh well, sorry, Ashley.

900
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,440
 But yeah, good, good guests.

901
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,760
 All right, I'm going to do a pick.

902
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,320
 So long time listeners will know that I quite like Agent Tchaikovsky.

903
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,680
 And I'm also quite a big fan of Keering Gillan.

904
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,720
 And so when I saw that Keering Gillan was running a live action role playing game or

905
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,840
 no, sorry, he's running a role playing game live on a panel for Agent Tchaikovsky, Emma

906
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,680
 Vicelli and Amal Mocta.

907
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,120
 I was like, I have to go to that.

908
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,280
 I got there half an hour early.

909
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,840
 The room was full.

910
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,960
 They turned away quite a few people and and Keering ran a game for the other three in

911
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,440
 which they were playing panelists at a world con who were doing a panel about a game that

912
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
 they had made.

913
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,480
 So the panel made their characters and then left the room re-entered as the fake character

914
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,480
 they just made and then those people made characters to play the game in the game.

915
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
 Right?

916
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,760
 Now, this was quite confusing.

917
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,840
 I went with Andy and Joe.

918
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,200
 It was Joe's birthday, happy birthday, Joe.

919
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,680
 And that was the first panel she's ever been to at a world con.

920
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,760
 So it was quite the introduction.

921
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,520
 And it was phenomenal.

922
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,240
 It was so good because they took questions from the audience like it was a real panel.

923
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,200
 So you've got the person who's like, this is really more of a comment than a question

924
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,160
 which got a big round of applause from the audience, which doesn't usually happen.

925
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,800
 And just Keering, prancing around, he's like, oh yes, no, the floor opens up and there are

926
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,640
 demons down there and the Tolkien fans that are squabbling over the Silmarillion.

927
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,040
 And it was just, it was so good.

928
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,920
 And I'm really sorry it wasn't on replay, but it was probably the best program item

929
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,960
 I've ever seen at World con and I'm so sorry Alison.

930
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,080
 And I got kicked out because it was full.

931
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,200
 So thank you, John, for telling me in Masti, tell what.

932
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,680
 Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

933
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
 But I, that's, yeah.

934
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,640
 But I said to, and then I met Keering Gillan at the post Hugo reception and I was like

935
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,960
 squeezing to him.

936
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,880
 And then I told him the question I asked when he came, I was like, I was one of that question.

937
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
 He was like, brilliant.

938
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,200
 When I talk about that question, how it really showed the people getting the panel and I

939
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,160
 was like, oh, so anyway, so yeah, I like Keering Gillan, then he's good.

940
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,560
 And then Emma, and then I met other people and I had a lovely time.

941
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
 Thank you.

942
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:36,760
 So I thought the idea of picks was to highlight things that other people do.

943
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,280
 Well, you can go and play die the role playing game.

944
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,400
 And if you're ever at a convention where Keering, because sometimes Keering runs 36 person games

945
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,880
 where he plays evil Keering Gillan and he's like the god for six different groups flitting

946
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
 between them.

947
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,600
 And that also sounds amazing, but he, this is not the only time he will run this.

948
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,160
 I, I feel like, I feel like this is a point of the future that going to see Keering Gillan

949
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,280
 do his thing and not being so busy at conventions that you can't see any program.

950
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,120
 I got to one program item that I wasn't involved in.

951
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,720
 So that is my pick.

952
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,640
 And two of the guests of honor at this convention are Claire Braley and Mark Plummer, the eminent

953
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,240
 Mark Plummer who said to third telegram earlier this episode.

954
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,040
 And they are Britain's greatest living fan writers and they, oh, that is, that is in

955
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
 Jupiter.

956
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,480
 And I've got a present for them.

957
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
 You know what this is.

958
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
 Do I?

959
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
 Oh, good.

960
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
 I know what it is.

961
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,480
 I just have to find it.

962
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,080
 I don't know what it is.

963
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,080
 John Cox and brought a load of pins over to the fan funds table.

964
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
 I did.

965
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,600
 And I immediately brought one, but one which I thought would be a fine pin to give to

966
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:47,600
 Claire and Mark because it is a real society for the protection of birds, shag.

967
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:53,160
 And one of the things about Mark and Claire's guest of honor speech, which is my pick, and

968
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,440
 they basically do their, they are very serious fan writers.

969
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,280
 Yes, they are very serious.

970
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,760
 And they have a, an obvious resentment of tradition.

971
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,880
 And they are also extremely interested in fan history.

972
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,120
 So what they did was a really extremely serious canter through fan history, through the medium

973
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,640
 of extremely silly photos of all of their friends.

974
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
 Yes.

975
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,800
 And it was hilarious.

976
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,000
 And if you are one of their friends, you should watch it.

977
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,520
 And if you aren't one of their friends, you should watch it anyway because you will

978
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,760
 probably laugh quite a lot.

979
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,000
 It is a very funny speech.

980
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,280
 And one of the things that was not in it was any mention of their no shagging disclaimer,

981
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,040
 which I thought was quite interesting.

982
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,040
 We have five minutes.

983
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,520
 Have you done your pick list?

984
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,280
 No, my pick is, well comes, like well comes.

985
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,200
 I mean, I did see lots of panels and like the name, the titles of them all have basically

986
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,400
 left my brain because my brain is going, oh, there's a Hugo there.

987
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,960
 So we'll get into those on a future episode.

988
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,760
 But I mean, well come, well come.

989
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:03,120
 James, so James Shields has just put a picture of Karen Gillan on the, on the discord and

990
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,720
 said, I've just realised this is not who John was talking about.

991
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,360
 And it is probably a sign of my flavour of nerd that I was more excited about Karen Gillan

992
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,080
 than I would be about Karen Gillan, which is quite a statement.

993
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:22,040
 So from Mark's, they have never seen them in the same room.

994
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,880
 So, yes, a shag.

995
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,240
 Bridget also has a shag.

996
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,840
 I'm glad you've got a shag, Bridget.

997
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,840
 Of course.

998
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:35,280
 I mean, I hope you're all enjoying the flavour.

999
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,920
 What it is like to record a podcast with John and Alison and admiring the edit job John does

1000
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,920
 every week.

1001
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
 We'll talk.

1002
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,920
 Yes.

1003
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,400
 And people came and I only knew two of them, which was genuinely baffling to me.

1004
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,520
 And one of them said, I love how you don't talk over each other and don't interrupt.

1005
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:58,200
 And I was like, this table talk might be awkward because you listen to an edited podcast and

1006
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,800
 it ain't always like that.

1007
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,560
 So we had to explain that we record separate streams.

1008
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,920
 And so John removes all the times when I talk over John Liz and John talks over me and

1009
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,800
 Liz and Liz does not ever talk over anybody except sometimes there's a zoom glitch.

1010
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,800
 Other than that.

1011
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:23,080
 I do sometimes when I'm like, Alison, shall we get back on topic?

1012
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,080
 No.

1013
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,920
 But yes, does anyone else have any?

1014
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,080
 Does anyone have any questions now before we wrap up?

1015
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,920
 I hear muttering about comments in the audience.

1016
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,240
 I don't believe we have no questions.

1017
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,240
 Bridget comments the shag is available on eBay.

1018
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,240
 I didn't know that you could get them there, but apparently...

1019
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
 I didn't know.

1020
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,800
 Yeah, no, I didn't know you could get a shag on eBay.

1021
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
 Interesting.

1022
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:52,360
 Lea Neel asked on the Discord what the question I asked in the Dye panel was and it would

1023
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,480
 take so much explaining, but I won't explain it on the podcast.

1024
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,840
 But if you want to know, I will be in a bar at some point.

1025
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,160
 So do come and find me and I will talk to you enthusiastically about it at length.

1026
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,160
 Closing remarks?

1027
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,760
 I'm the moderator now.

1028
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,560
 I would like to thank the tech team in the room.

1029
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:15,800
 I want to thank them for all of the work they've been doing over the last few years.

1030
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,000
 JT always makes recording the podcast incredibly easy.

1031
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,080
 It's easier to do a live podcast at a convention than it is to wrangle the Zoom.

1032
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,200
 So JT, thank you very much.

1033
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,400
 And to the rest of the tech also, thank you very much.

1034
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,120
 I met JT yesterday.

1035
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
 I'm just going to say...

1036
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,120
 I'm not met JT, but...

1037
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,120
 No, no, no.

1038
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:38,560
 And he was explaining that because of doing opt forbs, they could now set up this...

1039
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,760
 They knew how to set up this room for every podcast in the world, because they have recorded

1040
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,840
 opt forb, and after that nothing is ever as bad ever again.

1041
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:53,080
 We were talking, so Kevin and Laurie Anderson from Hugo Girl were a Spaniard in my plus

1042
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,920
 ones for the reception and the afterparty.

1043
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,520
 And they were talking about recording an episode of Hugo's There with Seth, and they

1044
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,280
 said they were very impressed by the podcast room.

1045
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,080
 There's a podcast room at the convention, so if you want to record a podcast, you can

1046
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,400
 go and there's multiple microphones and you get a stick at the end with the different

1047
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,520
 tracks and they were like, "It's so good!"

1048
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,840
 And I was like, "Yeah, they asked us, they asked us, like, you know, what would you want?"

1049
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,320
 And we said, "We would want this."

1050
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,840
 I gave Meg the acceptable minimum what you actually really want if you're going to go

1051
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,840
 the mile.

1052
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,360
 And yeah, I know they were like genuinely like, they're really good.

1053
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
 So...

1054
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
 We're going to get cut off in like one minute.

1055
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
 So if you want to do...

1056
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
 They were very happy.

1057
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,360
 Thanks and stuff.

1058
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,320
 I would also like to thank Esther, Meg and Marguerite for running a fantastic Worldcon

1059
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:41,000
 and being very kind to put us on the programme.

1060
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,920
 And a round of applause for JT and Tech as well, because like we got distracted by

1061
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,440
 an ago.

1062
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:59,880
 I would also very much like to thank my lovely co-hosts, Alison and Liz, who have been very

1063
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,240
 good. We've recorded 116 episodes now, which is quite a lot.

1064
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,520
 And yeah, couldn't do it without you guys.

1065
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,520
 Love you both.

1066
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,520
 Love you too, John.

1067
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,520
 Love you too, John.

1068
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,520
 Right then.

1069
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,800
 And on that disgustingly sweet ending.

1070
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,800
 It's goodbye from me.

1071
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,800
 It's goodbye from me.

1072
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,800
 And it's goodbye from me.

1073
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:18,800
 [Applause]

1074
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:44,560
 [Music]

1075
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,800
 This podcast will end at the beep.

1076
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,440
 Brilliant.
