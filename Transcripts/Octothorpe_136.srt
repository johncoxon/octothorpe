00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 So, content. Shall we do some topics?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,240
 Topics. Content. Yes. Yes.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:25,440
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 136th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for Science

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,120
 Fiction and Science Fiction fandom, which is landing in your back garden and staggering around a bit

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,320
 on the 5th of June 2025. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and the 5th of

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,760
 June 2025 is a very, hopefully a very auspicious day for me because my daughter is getting married

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:51,920
 that day. Oh, congratulations Marianne and Kirsty. Yes, so I am. If she listens to this, she'll be

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,120
 very annoyed because it's super small. It's a super small wedding. So if you're listening to

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
 this early enough listeners, you can go and gate crash the wedding. Yeah, please don't drop the

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,280
 podcast until after 11 o'clock. I'm going to schedule it for midnight. Go, go, crash the wedding listeners.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,320
 Yeah, don't do that. Just be properly Vince Vaughn about it.

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,840
 And he says, "A tiny bit worried. I like it." I don't think you can actually do that unless it's

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,040
 in a church, but if it's in a church, you definitely can. This one is not a church. It depends if you've

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,360
 got a set of lock picks and a real desire. It's a yellows giving us more clues. It's not in a church.

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,680
 Not in a church. It's just a building in the United Kingdom that's not a church. I feel like

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,760
 that's really narrowed it down so often you go. Well, all right, I'm going to narrow it down to

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,160
 more. It's not in my house. It may not be an Allison's house either. I don't know. Yeah, no,

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,480
 we're having one of those things in the back garden with like a marquee and you see Don American TV

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,400
 shows. Having seen Allison's back garden, I'm going to hit the doubt button. Press X to doubt.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,800
 Yep, that. For some reason, there are very few outside weddings in the UK.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:09,440
 Right. Congratulations again, peeps. And we got some letters of a comment. Would you like to start

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,600
 with Chris's letter of comment on croissant's Allison? So we just have the one letter on the

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,040
 almond croissant episode, I believe, but it was a very good one. It was from Christopher J. Garcia,

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,800
 who writes everywhere else is weird, but coffee shops in Santa Cruz County are correct.

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,360
 Here an almond croissant is a croissant made of almond flour. My brain is exploded at this point.

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,280
 They're also delightful. This is true. Cakes made of almond flour are very good. So

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,960
 like seriously great. The exterior is perfect. And I very much hope at some point in the future,

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,320
 I will be able to come to Santa Cruz County and test this theory for myself. I think he also says

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,840
 that quasins are as limited to Facebook, go easier than elephant ears and as quasins turn out better

30
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,920
 with less attention, elephant ears go from delightful to weaponized in less than three seconds.

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,000
 Where elephants ears are a shoe bun. So yes, I think that's pretty likely. Thank you very much,

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
 Chris. Your letter made my mouth water. So there we go.

33
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,160
 We heard from Faro Mendelssohn. Actually we heard from Faro a little while ago, but we've just

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,800
 got round to doing this. Notice, Faro writes that the Carol Goldman Fund administered by Dream

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,200
 Foundry has funds to support the tenets of Palestinian fans, writers, artists, etc.

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,120
 The money has been disbursed for 2025, but in 2026 it will be directed to support Palestinian

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,000
 fans, writers and artists to attend Urecon in Berlin, which is Metropole Com. You should contact Dream

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,880
 Foundry for details if you are eligible or that's the link to spread if you would like to spread the

39
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,240
 word further and it is in our show notes. Thank you very much, Faro. We'll put a link to Metropole

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,440
 Com in the show notes as well. Thank you very much to Ming-Lui for writing in and now I know how to

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,520
 pronounce his surname and I'll put a link in the show notes so everyone else can learn to.

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,560
 We heard from Raj on the subject of our live episode from Reconnect and we didn't come to this

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,920
 last time. He says that he was almost disappointed with how coherent the live episode was and so

44
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,960
 clearly the solution here is more beer. Raj doesn't suggest the more beer. I'm editorialising

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,400
 that on the end. Raj just opined. I mean we could say that the solutions are clearly more beer

46
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:31,280
 or having Covid. So I think we should try more beer first. That's a noted biostatistician

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,840
 no bioinformatician Liz Batty with her medical knowledge. Correlation is not causation obviously.

48
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:46,080
 We also heard from Tammy Coxon on Blue Sky. Thank you for thank you to Tammy for writing

49
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,040
 us in and thank you for our nuanced discussion of the whole worldcon AI thing on the previous

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,680
 episode. We got very few letters on that which makes me believe that we maybe...

51
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,800
 Will we... Will we two nuanced? Do you want more hot takes? Let us know. Same number of takes

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,520
 but hotter presumably. Spicy takes. Spicy. I've only got so many takes in me. But then we have a

53
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,920
 pre-show because we have a pre-show where we start doing the spicy thing and Liz tells us to stop

54
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,440
 having a log. You wouldn't take off our headphones and go away. There was a very specific situation

55
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,400
 where I wouldn't do that. Which this is linked to yeah. Yes I mean I think I said Alice and John

56
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,520
 if you're going to have a big Barney about AI I'm going to take my headphones and wander off for 10

57
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:37,280
 minutes. Seems perfectly reasonable. On Facebook we heard from Jan Harley who you know noticed that

58
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,760
 our last episode was a little bit late but she hadn't missed our lovely voices because they're

59
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,640
 catching up on the back catalog and just got to the end of number 73. I do hope the concerns about

60
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:56,000
 the 2023 Worldcon at that time weren't justified. Mmm spoilers. Yeah I mean I think this is time for

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,120
 our regular disclaimer that we do not recommend starting for the beginning not least because we

62
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,160
 may have been completely wrong about something and had it all come back to bite us. If that's the

63
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:16,320
 case please don't tell us. Don't write. No tell us that'll be funny. Okay. Yes agreed. And we heard

64
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:24,640
 from Christopher Jay Garcia. This isn't Stajavu because he also wrote in on episode 134 and he says

65
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,880
 the conclave was delightful and ended up with Chicago winning unlike at the 2006 Worldcon.

66
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,920
 Do you know anything about the 2006 Worldcon? It was Worldcon held in 2006.

67
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,440
 Do you know this is a deep cut about site selection? I assume so. Probably. We should look it up.

68
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,920
 He also says that the Arthur C. Clark shortlist is pretty good and says I've earned a cookie. Brilliant.

69
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,200
 Yeah so so I am going to be very distressed if we discover that the Arthur C. Clark shortlist for

70
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,560
 the first time in living memory does not have at least one book that causes everyone to go

71
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,520
 what on earth is that doing there? I think it does have that book but that book might differ for

72
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,200
 different commentate. Which is actually always the case so that's quite good. Yes. Demonstrating

73
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:20,560
 this is a jury award and has scope for a jury with a range of views. Yes. Oh I'm sorry I've just

74
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,200
 gone back and looked up the 2008 Worldcon site selection so the one that was held in 2006 when I

75
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,360
 think I was not really paying attention to site selection so I did not remember that Denver won

76
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:41,120
 by 12 votes. Oh wow. Wow. So I've got a follow up question Liz. Yeah. Was the 2008 Worldcon in

77
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,800
 Denver? Yes. Intrifying. I honestly don't know if that's a trick question. Yes. It wasn't.

78
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,720
 Just didn't know that. I did not go. I hear it was good but uh Mile Highcon? No it's called

79
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,160
 Denvention I think. Denvention. Okay. I've heard of Denvention but it was very high up.

80
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,240
 It's all I remember that there were people who went and said actually the altitude was quite

81
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,360
 more of a thing than they expected. Who knew? Anyway I'll pop that on the show notes.

82
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,720
 We also had a lock from Ali Baker Brooks who wrote in on Reconnect which was the 2025

83
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,480
 Eastcon in Belfast. Great pro black great con amazing program and wonderful to meet so many

84
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:34,000
 newer con people energized by Glasgow in 2024. Um CSI agree with all of those things. Um I think

85
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 she says two things she says the con food was very good and very difficult for food restrictions

86
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,640
 and number two it was a great venue for many things but socially there wasn't a central hangout.

87
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,920
 And we were going to talk about Eastcon anyway but we are going to springboard into it with this.

88
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,040
 What do we think on those two criticisms? Well she's not wrong on the food. People who

89
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,720
 attend the hotel restaurant I think thought it was quite good and quite good value but there was

90
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,880
 an issue around cheaper food such as you know you might like to pick up a baguette or a snack.

91
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,240
 I feel like for the hours when it was open there was a cafe near very close to the

92
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,840
 hotel and that was quite a good source of you know the sort of things they sell at cafe near

93
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:26,240
 but when you're kind of saying well cafe near is a great choice for con food. Um I think that's

94
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,440
 an indication that there's a problem there and if you had a little bit more time to spend

95
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
 then for some of the times that George's market was open it had fabulous food of many tools

96
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
 and for some of the time there was a chip shop and apparently that was very good if what you

97
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,560
 wanted to eat was a fish and chips which I personally often do but other people might not.

98
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,200
 But so it was pretty limited that was an issue. I didn't really notice this because we had

99
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,160
 amazing breakfast at our hotel and then we didn't eat again until going out to dinner every night so

100
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,160
 I understand the time speaking from a place of privilege here. Um but I therefore didn't notice

101
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,840
 that there weren't very many cheap con food options. I think there was a lack of like stuff you could

102
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,400
 pick up and take away. Did eat in the hotel restaurant and I had some very nice like

103
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,320
 vegetable soup in a baguette which was reasonably priced but then you had to have half an hour

104
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,560
 free to queue up to order it and then sit down and wave at someone and hope they remembered

105
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,360
 where you were sitting to get it. There wasn't sort of a oh I'll go and pick up like a sizable baguette

106
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,280
 option apart from a very few that were in the in the convention center. Uh I mean I thought

107
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,720
 having said George's market was amazing. The food there was so good and tasty and pretty cheap and

108
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,560
 you know you didn't need that long to go and go and snag some but there are people who can't get

109
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:45,440
 out of the hotel and convention center at convenient times and St. George's market is not open on a

110
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,600
 Sunday or bank holidays so yeah I went to the Nero a few times and I very rarely saw anyone from the

111
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,480
 con in it so maybe we needed a big sign saying there is a Nero over here if you need a panini.

112
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,680
 Yeah I mean obviously a cafe Nero panini was a much better option than not being able to get a

113
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,000
 sandwich in the hotel but again it's only open in the daytime and and convention workers in

114
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,840
 particular tend to need food at quite a variety of times of day so yes Belfast was great for food

115
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,720
 generally but the con food was not always the best. I want to say I think these are reasonable

116
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,360
 comments. I am curious as to the extent to which this is worse or better than other

117
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,320
 Eastcom venues that we've been at previously. I think it's tricky right because Belfast in some

118
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,920
 ways was much better from a food perspective because it was in Belfast and especially like if you're

119
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,880
 at the NEC your options to go and find other food might be more limited than it is in a city

120
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,320
 that's a capital city and so yes I don't know I think that's got to be part of the consideration

121
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,720
 because like the NEC food venues get very busy in the evenings much more than the Belfast ones

122
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,800
 would do it as far as I could tell anyway from my experience of waiting in both places

123
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,360
 and so it's probably true that the bit act of venue stuff was not very good but the fact that

124
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,480
 you have it in a capital city I think changes the the conversation a little bit I would say.

125
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,640
 I did think that being five minutes walk from the centre of a capital city was pretty good

126
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,640
 generally and and that's actually something that that is is a benefit for Eastcoms it would be nice

127
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,000
 if we could hold more of them in cities I know it's difficult. Yeah I think it's a trade-off I mean I

128
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,240
 think we've certainly had better and worse cons food-wise I did like the last NEC one where they got

129
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,080
 the food trucks the food trucks are good. The food trucks make a big difference too. I don't think

130
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,920
 it was logistically possible to park one is a problem but I think a lot of the complaints on

131
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,320
 this one would have been solved by one food truck doing like flatbreads with hummus in

132
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,400
 and kibabs basically and that seems like yeah we are making trade-offs but there might be room

133
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,840
 to solve those whereas there are some places where like if you're so far out of town that you can't

134
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,400
 go anywhere and get any decent food in the evening then you can't really solve that as easily.

135
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,120
 I did think that Belfast shuts down more over the Easter weekend than a lot of places we've been.

136
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,120
 There are a lot more places that seem to close very early on Sundays or were kind of closed on the

137
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,800
 bank holiday. It is a long time since we've been to Liverpool for an Easter con but one of

138
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,160
 things about Liverpool for the Easter con was that we would we would spend some energy in trying to

139
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,800
 persuade local bars and restaurants to stay open. I mean before the weekend we would go in and say

140
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,880
 we are doing this people will want to eat if you are open on good Friday and Easter Monday and Easter

141
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,760
 Sunday then things will be better for you. I think things have changed a bit people say Belfast is

142
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,200
 a lot more open over the weekend than it was 10 or 20 years ago and I well believe that.

143
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,880
 Well when we were sort of discussing in committee one of the committee members was like

144
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,880
 remember everything will be shut on Sunday it will be a nightmare and then I went out and ate

145
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,880
 and drank on Sunday and I was like this seems to be a very pleasant nightmare which I'm quite

146
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,200
 enjoying really and so I think you're probably right. I think my impression and especially my

147
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,240
 impression from talking to people in Belfast is that it's changed quite a lot since Covid

148
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,960
 and I wonder whether the shock of everything forcibly going away for a while made the restaurants

149
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,040
 think well if we open on Sundays we'd get we'd might be able to get some more money and that might

150
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,720
 be quite helpful and then other people are like oh going out on Sundays it's quite nice isn't it?

151
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,920
 I believe Belfast City Council also changed some possibly possibly some rules they made they definitely

152
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,160
 made it easier for people to open over the Easter weekend. Well that's the other thing having been

153
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:44,080
 in Vienna a week later on a on May Day or May Day supermarkets don't open in Austria and on

154
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,960
 Sundays supermarkets don't open in Austria so like Belfast is very open compared to some places in

155
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,480
 Europe. So Ali also talks about social hubs what were our thoughts on that? I was quite surprised to

156
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,800
 see this because and I understand that I like bars but I thought that the Hilton bar was placed

157
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,600
 almost exactly equidistant from both chunks of programme space so it was in fact a central location

158
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,280
 and you could either walk one way through to the conference centre or the other way up to the

159
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:22,240
 Hilton's programme spaces and it kind of seemed fine to me and I spent quite a lot of time there

160
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,680
 maybe not quite as much as I like because some of the time it was a bit kind of noisy and full

161
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,880
 but most of the time it was great as a central space there was also kind of there were kind of

162
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,360
 rather impersonal lobbies for both of the for both of the sets of conference space but I'm not

163
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,680
 sure either of those are really great hangout spaces they were good places sort of rest for a

164
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,560
 little while between items. So I think yeah I agree with Alison in part I don't think the space was

165
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,840
 quite equidistant from the two sides of the convention because I think it probably was closer to the

166
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:58,480
 Hilton than the ICC but it was relatively marginal and I think in general it had quite a good central

167
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,960
 space for that but I will also say I'm not sure I'm I've never been a huge fan of conventions that

168
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:12,640
 only have one obvious social area I quite like having a mixture of places to hang out and catch

169
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,560
 up with people. Yeah I think it felt like the Hilton social space was good but it was probably a bit

170
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,320
 far from the convention centre to be the obvious social space if you wanted to hang out there and

171
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,480
 the convention centre social spaces were a bit not we're a bit sort of sterile and convention

172
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,400
 and century there was only that really that warm area outside the art show that it had sort of

173
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,920
 table and chairs could hang out in then there were some other kind of scattered sofas which I did

174
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,160
 like but then downstairs at registration where there were some you know there were some kind of

175
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,240
 displays and stuff on I think blood on the clock tower was played down there it's a shame there

176
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,560
 wasn't a bit more sort of like social space hang outy stuff that you could do down there.

177
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,280
 I think that's obviously going to be a problem with any site that's a convention centre hotel

178
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,840
 split but in general I thought the ICC worked really the ICC Hilton worked really well as a

179
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,440
 convention site obviously I suspect if stairs are a problem for you as an access thing then having

180
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,600
 to get the lift from once the other was probably a bit of pain in the neck but I don't know if

181
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,760
 anyone listening has opinions on that please do write in because I'd be interested to learn

182
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,360
 well I have some opinions on this because I use the lifts all weekend which is I think the first

183
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,480
 first time at Nista Khan I've really felt oh yeah that that's going to make it a little easier for me

184
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,960
 and they were fine and that's maybe why I think it's a bit more equidistant because there was

185
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,200
 just one little lift to get down to the conference centre or up I'm not quite sure there was one

186
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,600
 one lift that took you one floor to get from the Hilton to the conference centre that was

187
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,400
 normally empty and there was the main Hilton lifts there was normally a not very long

188
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,240
 queue for so it was fine but they were quite slow because as well as serving the Metcenine

189
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,080
 I mean that felt like a hotel that really needed escalators up to the Metcenine which would

190
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,120
 certainly have it but was built now or made in America yeah rather than that big staircase in

191
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,840
 the lobby so you were reliant on the Hilton lifts and they were kind of if you were trying to get

192
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,040
 up to a programme item at a point when there were like a lot of people going back and forth to their

193
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,320
 rooms it could take quite a long time nowadays hotels like that are built with escalators up to

194
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,440
 the Metcenine and then lifts that take you to the bedroom floor because of this exact problem

195
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,960
 especially if they've got a lot of conference space but if they had escalators then you

196
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:43,760
 couldn't use the stairs for photoshoot as I did see one day okay I mean you know I can't

197
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,560
 think of both stairs and escalators have been primarily to move people around building rather

198
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,680
 than to provide Instagram backdrops but what do I know oh the other thing I know the other thing

199
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,960
 I wanted to say about the layout which is in general it was all fine except there were programmed

200
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,240
 rooms called the board room in both the Hilton and the conference center and nothing was done to

201
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,520
 distinguish these so I turned up for at least one program item in the wrong one and went oh no

202
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,920
 and of course by the time I got over to the other one which took quite a long time it was full so

203
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,600
 boo yeah so I thought the commission would quite well from a flow perspective so yeah it was nice

204
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,960
 to look round look round nice to walk round I also really liked that the art show and the

205
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,040
 fan tables were next to each other and there was like a place you could hang out there I think

206
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,480
 that felt very good and I think part of the problem here is that like it's tricky right because on

207
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,320
 this podcast we do a lot of critiquing conventions and I think it's good and wise to critique

208
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,600
 conventions but honestly I'm just absolutely thrilled when we get a new venue for EasterCon

209
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,000
 that looks like it works even 60% well because it's not like we're drowning in great candidate sites

210
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,720
 so the food thing I think like that's an access issue and needs to be taken seriously but

211
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,160
 yeah if the bar's in slightly the wrong place it's also a thing you it's also something you can

212
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,240
 work on right like you if we went back to site we said hey you know how you sold approximately

213
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,520
 3000 baguettes or something you know because I think we do tend to eat on site quite a lot you

214
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,280
 know how you sold all these baguettes if you did it again would you mind putting a vegan one on

215
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,880
 that you'll sell another 200 then that's a good starting point for negotiation yeah true and you

216
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,240
 can't ask them to move the bar around because that would evolve like jcb's and stuff yeah I did

217
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,640
 wonder if where we heard in the bar is because it was a bit of a thoroughfare for getting between

218
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,320
 places and was sometimes very crowded maybe we needed to keep a bit of a channel there so people

219
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,120
 could actually get through because I'm sure I inadvertently stood in front of people and probably

220
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,280
 inadvertently stood in front of people in scooters who were trying to get around without going outside

221
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,960
 so that's another possible issue but yeah generally like would we go back to Belfast oh god yes in a

222
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,680
 heartbeat yeah if it if it was a if it was a viable place to go I would quite happily go back to that

223
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,440
 venue on an Easter weekend it was I think generally very good freescon and do you think it ended up

224
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:15,120
 being more expensive significantly more expensive than a mainland UK one or not so much you mean

225
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
 from the perspective of me going or from the perspective of the committee running it I mean I

226
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,840
 mean for the perspective of attendees but it's it's completely you know the comparison doesn't work

227
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,960
 for me because I just flew to Ireland so I'm such an outlier it doesn't matter but basically other

228
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,080
 people from this was a financial drag for me it was one of the most expensive Easter cons I have

229
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:43,200
 been to baby ever can I just say can you if you subtract the cocktails at the rattle bag from the

230
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,840
 cost of your weekend it is funny you should mention a cocktail rattle bag but I had five I think

231
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,680
 excellent meals out and a whole bunch of cocktails that and a normal Easter con I probably eat out

232
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:06,240
 once or twice so that's the difference of being in a big city you know top scale restaurants so

233
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,440
 so that's that that's what being in a capital city gets so I felt like I had a bit of a Belfast

234
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,160
 city break and also I'd spent you know a small fortune in a cocktail bar which I have never

235
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,160
 previously done at least a con I don't think so apart from that I think I think it was law

236
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,200
 price no no neither the NEC doesn't seem to have any amazing bougie cocktail bars I'm not sure why

237
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,440
 that is yeah because it's not you know Belfast's a capital city and you could tell and neither does

238
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,160
 he throw strangely no so it's interesting right I think probably the cost of getting to Belfast

239
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,840
 by plane was more for me in a spannier than it would have been to get the train down to most

240
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,560
 like places that hold east cons the cost of the hotel I would say probably a little bit dear but

241
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,200
 it's very difficult to tell because the insane things that have happened to hotel prices since

242
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:06,560
 covid like is that just what it would have it's hard to work out in terms of like eating a drinking

243
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,160
 in Belfast probably a little bit more expensive but I think the other thing is that because it

244
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,360
 was a capital city we probably could if we'd needed to eat in quite a lot cheaper than we did

245
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,520
 because you've got so many options and also the cocktails were delicious but not cheap

246
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,760
 but I certainly don't it doesn't stick out as significantly more expensive to me certainly

247
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,360
 I don't think it was cheaper but it didn't seem extortionate compared to anywhere else you're in

248
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,640
 Newcastle I thought those cocktails were phenomenal value and I think quite a lot of the food that

249
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,520
 we at was pretty good value as well sure but I could I could easily have spent 100 pounds on

250
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,840
 drinks in that bar over two nights and that is rather more than my usual alcohol budget in East

251
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,240
 con and so although I'm not saying it was bad value it was definitely higher outlay of money

252
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,360
 yes so the convention was expensive for me but I think every single individual thing I purchased

253
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,920
 was good value for money yeah that's good way of putting it I think that's that's the point

254
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:08,320
 so so I just had I just s drank far better than I normally do it and also I saved all my

255
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,920
 lunches so I didn't have to spend any better on lunches I think you had a it sounds like there

256
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:18,480
 was a much higher discretionary spend but in terms of travel and hotels which are the kind of non-negotiable

257
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,400
 bit it's not actually too much different than many bits of the UK if I wasn't staying in the

258
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,480
 main con hotel and that's pretty unusual for me so it would have been 40 quid a night more in the

259
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,160
 convention hotel though I think we probably have got about 40 quids less worth of breakfast so

260
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,080
 that seems fine um not quite 40 but again like it's a lot easier not to be in the con hotel in

261
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,080
 Belfast than it is at for instance I mean Heathrow is actually pretty easy but like there are some

262
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,680
 venues where it's very difficult fewer than they used to be because most of these airport and

263
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,760
 off-center sites have got clusters of budget hotels around them now in a way that again they

264
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,280
 maybe didn't 20 years ago so I mean I think we're going to Glasgow in 27 we're based to the crowd

265
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,800
 plaza the first time I went to the crowd plaza there was one budget hotel within walking distance

266
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,560
 whereas now I think there are dozens fair yeah I mean there's there's not quite dozens but there's

267
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,680
 you know there are there are a sufficient number and then if you can't walking into the town center

268
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,120
 as walking distance which is a bit further than it wasn't Belfast then they can as well so that that's

269
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,800
 the thing like when is the last time we went to a really truly isolated Eastacon venue I don't

270
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:39,040
 think we have for quite a while hinkley it went hinkley for like 20 years yeah before my time I'm

271
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:46,080
 going to look up the Eastacon venues and find out Bradford in 2013 yeah all right would be the last

272
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,080
 properly isolated one I think which one is that and even then like Bradford does he do court yeah

273
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,400
 no the Cedar the Cedar Court has some fabulous curry houses with an easy walking just if you

274
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,560
 want to be food that's not curry it's a bit harder yeah but it doesn't have hotel it doesn't have any

275
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,960
 hotels in walking distance yeah and so they they basically had to put on a bus for that to make other

276
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,120
 other things viable I mean I stayed in the fabulous Bradford hotel I remember it was incredibly cheap

277
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,400
 but yeah that that hotel is really truly if you don't stay there you are getting a bus or a taxi

278
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,880
 or walking very long way but that is kind of the last one right like Harrogate there are a few in

279
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,440
 in walking distance including one in the car park basically they've been Heathrow

280
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,840
 Talford had some Belfast had them Birmingham has them yeah I mean and that that that changes that

281
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,760
 changes your access and your cost conversation right because it means that you've got more options

282
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,880
 to suit what it is you need in an ideal world and obviously like most conventions I hesitate to say

283
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,600
 all conventions although I think the vast vast majority will set rooms aside in the main con

284
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,320
 hotel for people with access needs but obviously there is a conversation there about if those rooms

285
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,120
 cost more you also have to make sure you've got like a bursaries program or something to make that

286
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,840
 work because people may not be able to afford it otherwise but you know we do do bursary schemes

287
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,680
 and stuff so that is that is something we are doing I think else on Easter come if you're listening

288
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:22,560
 to this then the Easter can't catch up has closed I hope many of you listened to them because I

289
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:28,880
 totally forgot and did not I did this Dwellie catch up so after last year I my life is going

290
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,560
 through one of its periodic busy times at the moment so I don't know it's complicated it is yeah

291
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,520
 so like I probably would have done if it wasn't for the fact that Easter was directly before one of

292
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,800
 the big conferences in my field so my my time immediately afterwards has been extremely busy and

293
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,920
 that is a typical it's usually quite busy but it's not usually quite as full on as it was this year

294
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,600
 so we can only speak for three of us I would be interested to hear from anyone involved with Belfast

295
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,680
 how they how their catch up went yeah like did they actually get as many people logging in and

296
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,720
 watching stuff as before because it seemed it seemed quite and also the the con discord usually has

297
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,520
 kind of trickles of conversation after the con although admittedly some of the time that is due to

298
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,080
 everyone reporting positive covid tests and there was a bit less of that this year but it went very

299
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,840
 quiet very quickly and it didn't seem like there was also much discussion of stuff people

300
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,600
 people watching or if there is a thing where you could you know almost plan to have people posting

301
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,680
 in the discord occasionally after the con saying oh I've just watched this and it was great and

302
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,600
 encourage that because then more people remember that the catch up is there and also what are we

303
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,520
 doing with all these catch ups are we didn't tell for save them to be conversation sent them to

304
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,720
 be archived with places that Alison will now take as she was involved the science fiction

305
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,840
 foundation fan act org both with sort of statements saying available for researchers but please don't

306
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,600
 stick up all the internet and yeah so I think that's about as best you could I do want this stuff to be

307
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,040
 systematically saved but it is quite hard unless you said that to your people when you started

308
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,240
 which I think we did yes and when if we should be all right it's just just occurred to me

309
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,840
 should we be trying to identify a few items before the con where we would like to not only save them

310
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,400
 but maybe put them up publicly later on as a sort of taster of if you like this program item why

311
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,800
 don't you come to next year's Easter con there'll be another hundred of them yeah so I think I think

312
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,440
 you could like I've not really thought about this and like you know this is definitely a

313
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,720
 spectacle for future conventions but there's no reason you couldn't say to people are you happy

314
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,080
 to be streamed are you happy to be on the catch up for members only are you happy to be on the

315
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,720
 internet publicly and separate that out as a separate thing and then you know if you do have

316
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,440
 panels where people are happy to where everyone was happy to be on the internet publicly you could

317
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,720
 consider those as tasters if you wanted to the only thing I worry is if you have that tick box

318
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,440
 does it make people more reluctant to tick the other tick boxes because psychology is a funny

319
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,920
 old thing yeah I think maybe you do it kind of preemptively uh you in fact contact all the people

320
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,600
 you know you identify some lucky candidates or maybe you look at like the guest of honor interviews

321
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,440
 or something and and talk to people on them and say actually would you be happy to do this

322
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,800
 totally optional no problem if you say no but just it occurs me it's like it's uh it's a nice thing

323
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,920
 and we might be able to use it to be a sort of you know little bit of publicity for us and also

324
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,440
 give people on the internet some more content but not give away the whole thing so that people have

325
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,560
 to join and watch it there you go idea for you for free future Easter cons which I'm not going to do

326
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,240
 any work for have fun yeah no I feel this is all part of future Easter cons take note because I'm

327
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,800
 not sure I'm ever going to run another one so do we have anything else on Easter con so one of the

328
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,280
 reasons I had a very expensive Easter con was that I spent an enormous amount of money in the cocktail

329
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:04,400
 bar in our hotel um and that cocktail bar rattle bag has just won an award for best bar in northern

330
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,400
 Ireland so you see it's not just us who liked it yeah it was phenomenal worth going to Belfast

331
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,000
 for I'd say if you like cocktails I will yeah I would say if I ever went to Belfast again I would

332
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,560
 be making a trip specifically there there were other places I'd go as well I'd go to region ramen

333
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,080
 again because that was great but but yeah no I would I would consider it uh to be a place you

334
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,920
 should visit if you go since Easter I have twice been out with people and they have called out a

335
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:39,040
 cocktail bar to me and said I used to really like that one but now it just seems to be so you know

336
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,360
 it might spoil you rattle bag might spoil you for Commodore garden cocktail bars I I had a

337
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,960
 chilli mango frozen margarita for two dollars fifty so I have not been spoiled there is a place

338
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,120
 in Newcastle called Little Robo and they were doing chilli margaritas and they were fucking excellent

339
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,800
 so you know other cocktail bars are available I've never had a I've never had a martini as good

340
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,080
 as the one I had at rattle bag though so like you know it is it's very good oh the cacao infused

341
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,600
 boulevardier that wasn't on the menu because we got to the point where we drunk all the cocktails

342
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,000
 on the menu so they had to suggest other things to us yes we did that when we went with tami

343
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,480
 cox and we did the words I think we mentioned that in the live episode something we did mention

344
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,320
 in the live episode because it hadn't happened yet is that tommy and james commissioned some lovely

345
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:34,080
 sort of spirits glasses with the reconnect logo etched into the sides for the committee and I

346
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,360
 christened mine with poutine and ginger ale which was very lovely thank you very much to tommy and

347
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,520
 james for that gift and it goes in the dishwasher because it's etched so just fantastic choices

348
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,120
 all around and I don't know if we talked about this on my live episode but I wanted to talk about

349
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,720
 games when do you not want to talk about games games at the east corner games generally games

350
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:02,320
 at the east con so I this east con is the first east con I remember having role playing games and

351
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,440
 social deduction games on the program as actual programmed items and I thought that was wonderful

352
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,680
 I think when I think it worked really well I think I thought the games room was pretty good it was

353
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,960
 run for them by a local game shop with volunteers yes I think this is a very good wheeze and I think

354
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,640
 that is a good wheeze but I think kind of my family walked in and they immediately suggested a

355
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:35,040
 a stupid party game for us to play which probably wouldn't be a likely choice for any family at

356
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,920
 the east con but certainly wasn't really a very good choice for us and then we found our kind of

357
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,000
 head banging number game and so I did I did play a stupid party game the other day that I liked

358
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,120
 but but no so I thought it was a really good idea and I think that probably is a good a model that

359
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,480
 works quite well if you can get a game shop that is attached to a games club who will all come in

360
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,560
 and volunteer and in return for their badges and wouldn't otherwise be at the con it's like a good

361
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,640
 bet to me it ran on weekend it was pretty good they had quite a lot of games including you know

362
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,160
 I mean I like games rooms generally so you know I thought it was almost fine I think having a

363
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:18,800
 games club run the games room was very good because I think it divorced the games room from the

364
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,360
 culture of games rooms at east cons and I think that was good because as someone who very much likes

365
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,920
 games but finds the games room at east con has been sometimes extremely insular and not very

366
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,440
 welcoming I think having a company come in that didn't have that baggage but did love games

367
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,880
 who was like just happy to run games and be gamers that was very nice yeah I thought the games

368
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,200
 room worked very well and it was interesting to me in the light of like the zu con run we did at

369
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,040
 Glasgow where that's one of the scenarios like I actually thought having the dealer in the

370
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,280
 dealers room who were selling games be the same people that were running the games room was nice

371
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,240
 because like obviously that means that if you play games in the game room they might be able to

372
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,560
 able to sell it to you in the dealers room and yeah there's there's some interesting

373
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,720
 thought being able to sell them to you straight there in the game room was perfectly good idea it

374
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:16,000
 also works yeah yeah yeah because Glasgow did this west end games which is based in Glasgow ran a

375
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,760
 bunch of the gaming at the Glasgow Worldcon and I would quite like to see east cons pursue this

376
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,640
 more vigorously because I think it might be an absolutely fantastic idea but I also think it might

377
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,320
 mean that you introduced the gaming communities in various cities to east con and then they might

378
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,160
 tell people about east con so they can might also be advertising listeners it has an issue which is

379
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:45,360
 that we have a bunch of other areas of the convention where it would be possible to give people

380
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:51,120
 privileged access to sell to our members in return for them doing something for the con and we tend

381
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,400
 to not do that because we've had bad experiences obviously in the past um but probably a very long

382
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,280
 time ago so this might not matter when also I think part of the thing is that to run a good

383
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,440
 games room you need a good games library and asking a member to bring a good games library and

384
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,320
 stay in the games room all weekend is very different to asking like a local games cafe to do it so I

385
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,840
 think that's another element but this is all because this is also largely how games conventions do it

386
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:24,400
 not entirely but you'll often see at games conventions that you'll obviously at games conventions that

387
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:32,000
 like shops run or not shop necessarily but cafes run the board game library yeah yeah yeah I mean I

388
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,680
 think the thing we are that specifically having a Belfast is that it wouldn't be feasible really for

389
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,960
 the people who normally do the provide a library of games to do it because it was in Belfast and so

390
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,840
 that might have meant by necessity we have to go and talk to someone who doesn't need to bring

391
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:54,960
 them across the ocean um I noticed there are also uh snag tights were dealing at Belfast which is a

392
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,120
 very nice idea but I don't think they actually had much stock there was sort of there in a sort of

393
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:04,240
 more promotional way and talk to people and to come back next year um because it wasn't really

394
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,640
 feasible for them to bring a whole load of tights in different sizes over 12 fast and that might

395
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,920
 also be the case actually that selling may not be the solution for them for for east come but they

396
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,880
 did have a lovely time so yeah so it's interesting so I would be I mean I have a feeling that we've

397
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,760
 done this with a games shop before but can't remember but I think what what it sold was presumably

398
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,560
 the games company well I hope they did well out of it because what I wonder is whether we've talked

399
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,720
 to them to games shops and cafes before but they haven't known if it would actually be a viable

400
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,400
 thing for them to do because they don't know like what the arrangements are between to be guaranteed

401
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,000
 themselves did they just come along knowing they'd sell some games on a quiet weekend for them etc

402
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,240
 um yeah I went in the game dream we played some games I think they made pretty reasonable

403
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,920
 suggestions for us although I think yeah maybe they were uh occasionally pitching it at like a

404
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,880
 slightly lower level than they might have if it was a games convention and there were people who

405
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,080
 were happy to play reasonably serious games quite late at night but we played some good games

406
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,080
 probably depended who you got I think it very much depends because like yeah if they'd

407
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:16,000
 suggested stupid party games to me I'd have been like yes please um and like I play crunchy games

408
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,520
 but I also like stupid party games like it's not so much uh only I always want to play super complex

409
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,560
 games at conventions neither do I always want to play super uncomplex games at conventions so like

410
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,640
 my my taste expresses multitudes oh yeah like sometimes I'm totally happy to play silly games

411
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,280
 as long as I can cast a fireball in a game at some point I think it's more just making sure

412
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:46,160
 yeah maybe they get just making sure they pitch it correctly we played the flow board game is that

413
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,000
 good I still haven't seen the film but I am informed it is as tense as the film because basically at

414
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,800
 any time um you're trying to build like little workways for your animals and anytime away from

415
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,280
 come and sweep them away and you have to start all over again and it is timed oh that sounds very

416
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,640
 that sounds very stressful yes that sounds much more stressful than I found the film have you played

417
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,160
 magic maze have I played magic maze no magic maze is a real-time timed game where you're like a

418
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,040
 group of magic users trying to get through a maze which is set in a shopping center for some reason

419
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,400
 but you're not allowed to talk you can only use gestures and each of you can only move the characters

420
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,280
 in certain directions and so you've got to do it all in real time just by like staring at each other

421
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,360
 meaningfully and it's very stressful but it's very good and I very much like it so maybe I would

422
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:43,680
 very much like flow too so it's basically the opposite of space team in that it's individuals

423
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,680
 on the ground now in that it's silent rather than space team which is basically the loudest game

424
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,440
 it is possible to play yes yes all the stress of space team with none of the noise yeah oh that

425
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,360
 sounds good it is it's it's good not everyone likes it some people find it extremely stressful

426
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,000
 I have added it to my wishlist oh you're wishlist

427
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:18,240
 Seattle 2025 is on the horizon and we're going to talk a little bit about some things about that

428
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,400
 one of the things we're going to talk about is the consultative vote on issues pertaining to

429
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,760
 Waspous so there are two consultative votes this year there's a consultative vote on

430
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,120
 ratifying the amendment to abolish the retro Hugo Awards and there's a consultative vote on

431
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,160
 ratifying proposed revisions of Hugo Award categories for best pro and best fan artist

432
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,360
 what do we think about these by the way you've missed the deadline listeners it was at the end of

433
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:52,080
 May the the thing opened for May and May was really busy so we didn't talk about it I'm not

434
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:58,480
 clear why it needed to stop at the end of May and maybe we could discuss that a little bit

435
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,760
 because the first business meeting is on July the 4th yep so why does it need to stop by me if

436
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,360
 that whole thing is just to get an indication of where members are at it seems like you could

437
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,840
 wrap it up basically anytime before that first meeting and it'd be fine but I don't know whether

438
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:18,880
 you two agree I think they still format agendas in extremely old-fashioned ways and they'd wake

439
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,520
 some weeks to do it ready for printing but the consultative won't won't be in the agendas

440
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,480
 okay no okay that may make no sense then um I do have a strong opinion on the um division of

441
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,800
 artist one which is that it is possible that artist does need some revision but this is definitely

442
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,400
 not the way to do it and I thought um I think we know the no explanation was given by Richard

443
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:49,600
 Mann and I agree with almost every word of that I basically agree I think I can see why this was

444
00:41:49,600 --> 00:42:00,320
 introduced I mean I will note it was struck down in Chicago and a very similar thing was brought to

445
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,160
 Glasgow and I guess they're going to keep going until they get it through but I am not sure that

446
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,800
 this is how it needs to be changed if it needs to be changed which I agree it might well need to be

447
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,080
 changed but um I'm not convinced this is it well I mean they're basically saying that

448
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:24,400
 work in fan artists cannot be sold which seems outrageous just outrageous you know it's it's

449
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,200
 tricky isn't it because like if we sold episodes of the fat the podcast that would that would be

450
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,640
 disqualifying and that's fair but art is a bit different for historic reasons no but isn't there

451
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,960
 a one quarter of your income thing for the fan categories which is is problematic in itself but

452
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,240
 differently problematic so they're not so so but saying it cannot provide more than one quarter of

453
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,520
 your income would be a start which would be fine for fan artists because I'm sure there aren't any

454
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,440
 fan artists who are making yeah yeah there's not much money in it guys no I think I agree I think

455
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,440
 I think um there are probably things that might want to be tweaked but I'm not sure this is how

456
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,200
 you tweak them um Liz what do you reckon I mean I don't have strong feelings about the art category

457
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,360
 because they don't do any art I do see I think what they're trying to do is you know um I think

458
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,880
 they're trying to clarify things a bit other than like you know fan art is vibes or whatever

459
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,880
 which I do agree with but I don't really personally have an opinion on where you should

460
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,600
 draw the line because I'm not drawing the line basically I think what it knocks out of fan

461
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:37,120
 artist is the sort of fan artist who will do you a you know do you a headshot of your d&d character

462
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:42,880
 for 25 dollars or whatever which arguably yeah if you did it by an income threshold instead would

463
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,720
 be in fan artist rather than pro artist seems like a benefit but I'm not sure we're nominating those

464
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,600
 those people who fall into that category are not really getting nominated for best fan artists

465
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,160
 at the moment anyway I'm not sure so yeah I will point out that the things in the consulted

466
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,880
 vote I think that were passed by 2024 and are being ratified by 2025 so they've already passed one

467
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,640
 hurdle and this is just the second hurdle do you think that consultative consultative votes should

468
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,440
 be used primarily for ratifications or do you think they should be used before that because so

469
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,400
 far the ones we've done have been for the best indie film Hugo for these two and I'm sure there was

470
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,880
 another one that I'm forgetting and that has all been ratification as far as I remember so do we

471
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,520
 think that's how this tool should be deployed or or what we reckon I think that's the only way you

472
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,400
 can deploy it realistically because the timeline like so the deadline for submitting

473
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,560
 motions of business meetings always a month before and then you would have to look at those

474
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,960
 select some for consultative votes and run the consultative vote in that month which is a pretty

475
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,800
 busy month if you are following the normal schedule of the business meeting is actually at the

476
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,960
 WorldCom so it seems like it's something that they can do a kind of consultation on and you can sort

477
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,120
 of view it as well the business meeting has passed this let us also take the temperature of this

478
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,960
 year's membership as a whole on it and you can do it early enough that it doesn't interfere in a

479
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:10,080
 very very busy time for the Hugo's sorry for the other Wussfuss division having said that this one

480
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:16,000
 I'm not sure why this one needs to cut off in May as we said because it the results won't be out

481
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,360
 in time to and the other consultative vote is on just basically abolishing the retro Hugo's so

482
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:27,280
 I say yes let's abolish the retro Hugo's it's time I was persuaded by Fiona Moore's counter

483
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,920
 argument on that which is basically we're only to do seven more and then it goes away anyway so

484
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,680
 let's just carry on and I was like yeah fair I thought that was not a bad counter argument but

485
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,800
 I was also worried that if it wasn't killed then people would start inventing new reasons to give

486
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:50,240
 out new new old awards and it's just so yeah no get rid of them so we were split we were split

487
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,960
 I mean if we don't get with a bit of them I will therefore are in complaint in seven more years I

488
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,760
 guess at the issue being that if we only have to do them seven more times but if one of the current

489
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,840
 cons chooses not to run the retros then we'll come back around in 25 years yeah and when we're

490
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,040
 doing the episode of rock 4 in 25 years this it will give us a way to talk about that's fair I

491
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,680
 mean I I was torn on it um and I I think I actually might not have cast a vote because I was like

492
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,720
 I'm not sure I care enough either way I would like to say that on the Seattle website it says that

493
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:33,040
 Wussfuss is pronounced Wizzfuss yeah so I've just noticed this if you go to the Wussfuss page on

494
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,400
 Seattle it says it's known as Wussfuss and then in brackets it says open quotation marks Wizz

495
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:45,360
 spelled W-I-Z hyphen fizz spelled as in fizzy drink close quotation marks and I'm like no it's

496
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:55,440
 Wussfuss as in Wussw-U-ss fuss f-u-ss but not Wussfuss not Wussfuss that would be silly Wussfuss

497
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:03,280
 Wussfuss not Wussfuss or Wizzfuss Wizzfuss yeah does anyone pronounce it Wizzfizz all right I'm

498
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,120
 outraged is there something about weird about American the lack of vowels in American English

499
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:15,360
 again where where distinctions just don't happen in some sub-dialects but I'm not sure this is one

500
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,600
 of them the problem with saying about American English is obviously that there's quite a lot

501
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:26,080
 of different vowel sounds in American English absolutely yeah but there are sub-dialects of

502
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:31,200
 American English that have fewer distinctions between vowel sounds than you would normally expect

503
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,800
 what I would now like to do is ask Andy Openshaw to record himself saying this and send it in so

504
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,720
 I can splice it in next episode so we can get the Jordi dialect because I think that might be

505
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:50,400
 quite fun sure what Wussfuss yeah Y-I-F-I-I that's why I think it's pronounced oh I think we should

506
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:59,200
 just please everyone who listens to us please send please send a short mp3 of you saying the word

507
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,120
 Wussfuss in the way that you pronounce it yes everyone every listener every listener right in

508
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:11,360
 and then we'll put it together in a big schmorgas board yes please yes and I've been studying Swedish

509
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:19,600
 because I've go to archipelachon next month sorry I had some jam here's what's your non-sequitur

510
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:29,600
 and and it turns out that schmorgas board means sandwich table which is way less exciting than

511
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:36,800
 my concept of what schmorgas board means oh I mean I think that if I showed you a big pile of gold or

512
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,280
 a big pile of sandwiches one of those would excite you more than the other I think the only way to

513
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,120
 settle this is for a consultative vote on the pronunciation of Wussfuss

514
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:54,960
 Graham if you're listening if you want to do some good versus bad polls on this podcast do

515
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:01,600
 write in yeah look but if you want to do if if I didn't want to volunteer John to splice all the

516
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:08,080
 all the mp3s of Wussfuss together into a into a lovely um celebration of our um

517
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,040
 linguistic diversity but actually it does have very good especially if you're

518
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,960
 you're listening from somewhere far flung like you know Finland or Newcastle

519
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:26,240
 Jersey Australia Seattle the moon we know it's we know it's Wussfuss is Seattle we don't really

520
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,160
 need one of those can I just say I'm looking at pictures of schmorgas boards on um a well-known

521
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,000
 internet image search and I can confirm that they excite me very much yes I do but that

522
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,680
 oh nom nom nom nom nom nom nom oh yeah are you feeling hungry John ha ha ha right then listeners

523
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,800
 that's the Liz signal that we need to progress quicker to picks um so there's one other thing

524
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:57,360
 which is erin underwood wrote an excellent opinion it's uh what does our pet stand for opinion

525
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:02,080
 editorial is an editorial not always an opinion anyway erin underwood wrote an article on

526
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:08,080
 Faztev's Everny about selecting program participants for world cons it is very excellent one of the

527
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,360
 things she calls for is a bit more grace and understanding I think one of the reasons why we

528
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,640
 didn't get a lot of outraged comments on our last episode is that we are um largely at a chord that

529
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:22,320
 you know it's not too helpful to be very very shouty and angry about some of this stuff and so

530
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:29,600
 yeah we recommend you go read that I would also point out we should link to Jason Sanford who dropped

531
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:35,680
 an investigation into Seattle and it turns out that um his reporting indicates that all of this

532
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:43,440
 was triggered by a single person who had used chat gbt in the process uh and that's what caused

533
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,800
 everything that stemmed from there so it's just one volunteer who who used this tool and I'll link

534
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,280
 to that in the show notes as well worth worth having a read of both of those I think but we won't

535
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,560
 go into detail and I don't have a lot to say about them I just think they're interesting

536
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:02,640
 perspectives I don't know if I threw oh so if it was one volunteer using the tool once

537
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,320
 then one of the ways to spun is that um people were in a hole and started digging

538
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:13,840
 there's definitely a point there about volunteers and the lack thereof I'm not sure that big internet

539
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:20,160
 flame wars increase the uptake of volunteers for world cons and so if we want to have more

540
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,840
 volunteers to avoid using these tools we might want to consider how we treat those volunteers

541
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:30,800
 when we think that they've done goofed and obviously most of the outrage landed on the chair and the

542
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:37,520
 division head which probably as it should be really but even so it's still not ideal I have no idea

543
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,480
 who the volunteer was no I don't think I don't think that is known no and I think that's exactly

544
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,400
 correct really there's no point dropping the internet on the head of a person who did this in

545
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,280
 good faith probably who never occurred to them probably someone who was pushed for time and

546
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,000
 trying to speed things up and didn't think it would be a big issue and yeah you kind of have to

547
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,960
 protect your volunteers by saying okay the people higher up who could have potentially

548
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,760
 stopped this by being a bit more explicit in their in their instructions or whatever I think

549
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,800
 it's fair enough that they end up being the kind of public face of it yeah I agree and you know in

550
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:24,080
 sales defense that's exactly what they did all right let's do picks so that Liz can go and eat

551
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:32,960
 some food yes yeah can we have one day today today I want Hulk Liz at a smorgasbord because she's

552
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:40,560
 angry can we do that for art does that work please that would be great so yeah Hulk Liz at a smorgasbord

553
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:46,720
 yeah that's a nice simple hunt prompt right you and I can be sandwiches and Liz can be eating us

554
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:56,240
 um no too weird too weird all right the rest the idea was good oh I might just do it

555
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:03,280
 I would it's not often you get to see Alice and speechless uh so quite happy with this um right

556
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,280
 should we do picks sorry I'm not sure how a smorgasbord differs from a shark kuchibord

557
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:17,440
 more pickled herrings oh yeah maybe convey that in art oh I'm so I am really looking forward to

558
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,600
 going to the order dialers of Stockholm now yep good picks who's picking first I haven't picked yet

559
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:28,960
 so I'm not picking first right so I am being the least original and most unsurprising pick in the

560
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,400
 history of picks in that I am picking Andor either the second series of Andor or the entire thing

561
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,160
 because I have now watched it all um and can confirm it's very good I mean it's good enough that

562
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,920
 even if you have always hated Star Wars and think the whole thing is drivel it is probably

563
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:54,160
 worth watching Andor it is that good um it's such a good show yeah it's it's it's great tv is not just

564
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:03,040
 great for Star Wars no it's it is it is magnificent it is so good at as a mass market product

565
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:10,240
 writing a piece of television about what it is like to live in an oppressive empire how that affects

566
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:16,240
 lots of different ordinary people going about that or everyday lives and in particular how

567
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,360
 very ordinary people get radicalized and we saw that in the first series and we're seeing it we

568
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:28,880
 see it again quite a lot in the second series um towards so so for people who don't know Andor is

569
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:37,520
 a prequel to the Star Wars movie Rogue One which itself is expanded from a single line in the

570
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:43,840
 opening crawl of Star Wars so they took the single line that said the the rebel alliance had won

571
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:50,320
 its first battle and acquired plans to the death star and they made a movie Rogue One all about that

572
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:57,920
 and then Andor is a um two two series now finished you can watch the whole thing television series

573
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:03,360
 that explains how some of the characters in Rogue One got to where they are at the start of that

574
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,720
 movie and there are other characters a well who do not appear um and the whole thing is just

575
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,480
 immense in lots of ways and one of the ways it's immense is that the implication in there is that

576
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:21,760
 any other single line of Star Wars could be might be appropriate to be developed into an entire world

577
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,800
 that there is a universe of stories out here and including some quite good ones you wouldn't

578
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,200
 necessarily know this from watching all of the output of the Star Wars universe at the moment

579
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:38,160
 but it's not all being made for me um Andor definitely is though um it it's not the very end of it

580
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:44,560
 it kind of drifts a little bit it's still great it never gets less than absolutely great but there

581
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:50,240
 are some points in the last few episodes where they're clearly inserting hooks that are going to be

582
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:57,840
 part of the story in Rogue One and so that makes it as a standalone product just a tiny bit less good

583
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,480
 we had I'd seen Rogue One once when it was fairly new I don't think I saw it in the cinema but I

584
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,720
 think I saw it on television shortly after and um I hadn't watched again and it didn't

585
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,840
 really didn't watch it again until Andor was finished but now I have watched it um again and

586
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,320
 can confirm that it does the job of knitting it all together very well and also it stands up

587
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:21,200
 very well and now of course I want to watch Star Wars the the one true the one true Star Wars movie

588
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:27,040
 so yeah it's great go watch it fabulous stuff and buoyed up by that I've started we've started

589
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,520
 season four of the expanse so you know uh everyone take a drink only three more seasons to go

590
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:39,760
 and the season two gets shorter so you know you're within the finishing line oh are they

591
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,760
 yeah the last series only six episodes I got to the end of season three and I thought well they've

592
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,800
 kind of wrapped it up here as if there may not be any more so so season four they have to kind of

593
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:55,280
 start a whole new story off which is quite interesting yes so in the in the books the books are

594
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:02,960
 nine books and basically each three books kind of teller loosely like a l'alac I think they're

595
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:09,280
 eight books four to six and by extension seasons the latter seasons of the tv show tell a very

596
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,920
 interesting very very good kind of solar system politics story which I really enjoyed so yeah

597
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,920
 and then you know books haven't got weird and those good listeners I recommend it too

598
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:28,880
 oonnie i'm behind with it and I don't think it's quite as good as severance but that is sort of

599
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,400
 you know it's it's it's a it's a hell of a comparator right like it's not quite as good as

600
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,280
 what I would argue is one of the best science fiction series is of the 21st century are we

601
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:45,280
 blessed to have amazing shows like this on television is doing science fiction we really are that we

602
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,080
 no longer have to say has there been any good science fiction tv well holo and as a Russian

603
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,040
 episode of Star Trek once yep Liz do you want to go or do you want me to go now i'm trying to

604
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:01,520
 decide if I want to start an argument with Alison about televisual sf and fantasy of the 2000s but

605
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,560
 I think I will save that for another episode oh yeah no we could put it in as a sort of plot for

606
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:12,160
 yeah I need to you know have a bit more brain and not be quite so wasn't really thinking of the

607
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,760
 2000s you see here I was kind of thinking of the 1980s possibly the 1980s that was true but I

608
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,720
 think we should not overlook the contribution of stuff from the past 25 30 years because there's

609
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:28,160
 some good stuff there although Alison will probably get to in about 2040 so uh on the subject of

610
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:35,360
 j my course jdinsky uh and bowel on five and good tv from the 90s uh he's moved to the UK I saw

611
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,640
 yeah yeah it's quite a big step just to run doctor who

612
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:49,760
 I'm gonna pick a book listeners hey I know right I am going to pick welcome to forever by Nathan

613
00:58:49,760 --> 00:59:02,960
 Tavares um so this is a novel from last year it is a novel about a man called fox and fox is having

614
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:10,400
 a very recuperative time and then someone makes him a tiny little clone of his dead ex husband

615
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:17,040
 and he very much enjoys that ex husband because of the death but also ex husband because of various

616
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:24,880
 other things it's interesting I think it's really good I really enjoyed it it's kind of cyberpunki

617
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:33,120
 it's about a great many things and it uses the metaphor that it employs very deftly to talk

618
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,920
 about many of them um there is a particularly brilliant scene where some of the characters are

619
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:44,640
 walking through a city and then there is a glitch in their neural interfaces that means the beautiful

620
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,600
 lovely city that they are surrounded by kind of fades out and is replaced by the actuality of

621
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:54,640
 what surrounds them which is much much less savory and it kind of comes back to that central

622
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:01,040
 metaphor and uses it to talk about things like anxiety and masking but also talk about queerness

623
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:07,120
 and about what it is to be queer and what it is to be out it talks about protests it talks about

624
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:14,480
 the role of capitalism and technology in our lives and it talks about duties of care and

625
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:23,200
 it's just very good I really enjoyed it it spoke to me on many levels and its ruminations on

626
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:29,920
 unfettered capitalism and on the cult of personality that tends to lead those companies and on

627
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:36,960
 mental health issues all really resonated with me I would very much recommend people read it

628
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,840
 it yeah it's really stuck with me and I really really enjoyed it right I haven't read that yet so

629
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:48,080
 sounds really good so good I liked it I'm gonna pick a pick which I honestly don't need to pick

630
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,520
 because I'm pretty sure everyone on this podcast or listening to this podcast has either read it

631
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,320
 or he's going to read it but I'm going to pick the incandescent biomly tesh anyway you all know

632
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:02,640
 emlietesh won a Hugo for some desperate glory um and the incandescent is the follow up it is

633
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,600
 totally different in that it is I mean I would call it dark academia although the good reads

634
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:12,320
 pages full of people arguing about whether this is really dark academia so yeah but basically it's

635
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:19,840
 about magic school if the magic school was basically a private sixth form in the UK and can only teach

636
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:25,040
 magic because magic is basically like Latin it's this super niche subject the only a few rich

637
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:30,720
 schools can teach and it might get you into a good university to study study magic which you're

638
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,880
 probably not gonna actually do magic but you might go into another another career like and it is

639
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,320
 one reason I like it is it's very explicitly it's a very english school story but updated

640
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:46,880
 to the present day so there is a lot of teaching observations and lesson plans and you know working

641
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,520
 out sources of risk and pastoral care of your students and not enough time to fit everything in

642
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,960
 the day and I really like that I mean I'm not a teacher but I know enough to recognize what seems

643
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,000
 to be a pretty good portrayal of teaching in the modern system I also I do like the kind of the

644
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,320
 world building and the magic system that the leaker it is dr saffi walden and that is explained

645
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:16,320
 it is a joke hey yeah I spent a bit time going is that really a joke yeah okay so I really enjoyed

646
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:21,920
 it I found a pretty fast read I found it interesting I mostly like the central romance although there's

647
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:27,600
 kind of a you know a red herring that goes on which is a bit too obviously a red herring and in fact

648
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,400
 that would be my main criticism is sometimes bits of the plot were really obvious and I'm not sure

649
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,400
 if they were supposed to be really obvious and it's because the narrator cannot see like her

650
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:42,160
 her blind spots and flaws in not spotting them or if they're actually supposed to be a surprise

651
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:48,400
 to me which they were not but even kind of figuring out what was going to happen I still enjoyed it

652
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:54,000
 and what I really liked about it is that saffi is a middle-aged woman and I think you really get

653
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
 the sense of sort of reflecting on her life and reflecting on her past relationships you know at

654
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,040
 one point like she meets her ex-girlfriend and you can really kind of see us seeing like the path

655
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:08,960
 not taken and deciding like where she gets satisfaction from the path she has taken I mean I think

656
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,120
 you're all going to read it anyway but it is good it's not quite as good as some desperate

657
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,120
 worry but it's still very solid I would not be surprised to see it on lots of award shortlist

658
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:22,720
 next year is that one of the books is that a 2025 novel probably yes yes just come out I think

659
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:28,720
 that sounds very good my opinion people probably know but obviously not quite as good as some

660
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:34,160
 desperate glory is still incredibly high praise right that was such a good book even a book that is

661
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:40,800
 only 90% or 80% or even 70% is good it's still going to be entirely my jam so I'm looking forward

662
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,440
 to reading it I am also looking forward to her appearing at NovaCon I mean it's it's part of

663
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,200
 expectations right sometimes but glory I kind of went in with people saying oh this is good but not

664
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,960
 really many pre-made expectations whereas I went into the incandescent going oh this is going to

665
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,760
 be good it's a new aminitesh and so it's got very high bar to live up to so when I say not quite as

666
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,560
 good I might be marking it a little harshly but it doesn't have some of the kind of jaw-dropping

667
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:10,000
 moments I think it's deliberately a little bit more internal like a little bit less like the giant

668
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,080
 space opera ideas it's just a different book I'll probably get it in hard back and take it to

669
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,560
 NovaCon to get it signed all right in that case that was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye

670
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:25,920
 from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

671
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,600
 so

672
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:48,640
 so I have a new hobby which really doesn't have anything to do with the podcast but I'm so excited

673
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:54,080
 about it I want to talk about it is it playing games no it's buying games and charity chups

674
01:04:54,080 --> 01:05:01,440
 buying games and charity shops because it turns out that I need to go to a for a walk every day

675
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:07,600
 for my health but I hate you know stupid little walk for my stupid mental and physical help and

676
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,840
 I hate going for walks absolutely hate it but it turns out that if you say to me would you like to

677
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,240
 go for a walk that takes in two or three charity shops and you can buy games I'm like oh yeah no

678
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:21,120
 I'm up for that I come home with sax full and some of them are terrible but some of them are great

679
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,360
 so you know it's good and I was gonna mention it in terms of stupid party games we played

680
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:31,360
 that show stack which I paid three pounds for in the in the British Heart Foundation and it

681
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,560
 involves you stacking that shows and then removing that shows it is a it is an extremely close

682
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:42,080
 simulation much closer than many video games managed the big video games it's a much closer

683
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:47,200
 simulation than many board games managed and I've picked up all sorts of interesting things

684
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:54,400
 and some absolute junk oh god but I'm getting better I would dare say that's a dangerous hobby

685
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:00,080
 oh fab there's so many there's so many games and charity shops you have no idea and it's good

686
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:05,120
 for the planet right because it stops all of these games being I don't know if it does stop all these

687
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,720
 games going into landfill a lot of the better of the landfill anyway because I get them home

688
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,840
 inventory them and there's loads of bits missing and I go oh no that is junk every game will on an

689
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:19,200
 infinite timescale end up in the ground you should burn them if I put them in I mean yeah there's

690
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:25,440
 not get burnt bits that can't be recycled will get burnt in London ah because we have we have

691
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:31,280
 incinerator but this is one of the things with um this is one of the things with a card game

692
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:36,800
 called earthborne rangers is is entirely compostable quite more and more are I get more and more games

693
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:43,600
 that have no no non-couple parts yes and then I get I get games from the 70s that are like

694
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:50,320
 giant plastic monstrosities yep they have plastic boards and plastic pieces and plastic

695
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:55,840
 balls and it's amazing sorry that was way off topic but I just it will wear off in a bit guys

696
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,640
 shall we do the rest of the show notes oh also I am playing blueprints a lot

697
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:08,240
 excellent for those who don't know um this was actually the reason Liz thought to pick it was

698
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,840
 because the art for the subsequent episode we already knew in advanced listeners was going to be a

699
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:18,880
 blueprint of an almond croissant so that was that was uh Liz's inspiration for picking it I think

700
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:24,160
 is that right Liz yeah that reminded me that I could pick it and ruin Alison's life when I was

701
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:29,200
 like shall I not pick it because it might ruin Alison's life oh no I'll pick anyway it is good though

702
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:35,200
 well it didn't so so what happened was that we recorded that episode about two minutes before I

703
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:40,160
 got to the car and went off for holiday on the north north coast where I did not you know I

704
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,640
 hardly got onto the internet at all I certainly didn't play any video games and then I got home

705
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:51,280
 and John sent us the podcast to listen to and I got to Liz's pick and I went oh I have not yet

706
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,400
 bought that game I should see if it will run on my back and it does and so I have played it quite

707
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,720
 a lot but at the moment I'm mostly playing games with my family because it's back on a day weekend so

708
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:07,280
 I'm going to say that I have been playing this is massively massively off-topic now I've been

709
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:13,440
 playing the Zelda game haven't finished yet it's all right oh echoes of wisdom yes yeah I picked it

710
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,160
 and I think Liz has played it as well no not yet although I do want to switch though I have I've

711
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:22,480
 played up to about 90% of it and then stopped and this is something I do with a lot of games so I'm

712
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:28,960
 kind of like is this me because you have ADHD no I don't think it is I think I I kind of don't want

713
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,520
 just like I did it with Horizon Zero drawn and with dredge I kind of get to a certain point

714
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,120
 and go oh if I carry on much further they won't be any game left so I'll just place up the

715
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,760
 else for a bit and then come back to it except that I don't it's fair that's been Sadie HD
