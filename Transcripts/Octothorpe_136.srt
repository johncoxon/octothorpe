1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,140
So.

2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,140
Content.

3
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,140
Shall we do some topics?

4
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,620
Topics, content, yes.

5
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,280
Yes.

6
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:24,160
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 136th episode of Octothorpe,

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,180
a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,180
which is landing in your back garden and staggering around a bit on the 5th of June 2025.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,540
I'm John Coxon.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm Alison Scott.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,420
And I'm Liz Batty.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,320
And the 5th of June 2025 is a very, hopefully a very auspicious day for me

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
because my daughter is getting married that day.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,400
Oh, congratulations Marianne and Kirsty.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,940
Yes, so I, if she listens to this she'll be very annoyed because it's super small.

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,220
It's a super small wedding.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,000
So if you're listening to this early enough, listeners, you can go and gate crash the wedding.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,580
Yeah, please don't drop the podcast until after 11 o'clock.

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,840
I'm going to schedule it for midnight.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,360
Go, go crash the wedding, listeners.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,960
Yeah, don't do that.

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,760
Just be properly Vince Vaughn about it.

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,020
Alison sounds a tiny bit worried.

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,720
I like it.

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,600
I don't think you can actually do that unless it's in a church,

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,180
but if it's in a church, you definitely can.

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,040
This one is not in a church.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,380
It depends if you've got a set of lockpicks and real desire.

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,360
See, Alison's giving us more clues.

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,640
It's not in a church.

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,060
Not in a church.

32
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,100
It's just a building in the United Kingdom that is not a church.

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,280
I feel like that's really narrowed it down.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,080
So off you go.

35
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,020
Well, all right.

36
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,180
I'm going to narrow it down some more.

37
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,200
It's not in my house.

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,120
It may not be in Alison's house either.

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,820
I don't know.

40
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,440
Yeah, no.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,160
We're having one of those things in the back garden with like a marquee

42
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,140
and you've seen on American TV shows.

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,160
Having seen Alison's back garden, I'm going to hit the doubt button.

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,480
Press X to doubt.

45
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,680
Yeah, that.

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,880
For some reason, there are very few outside weddings in the UK.

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,500
Right.

48
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,420
Congratulations again, peeps.

49
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,900
And we got some letters of comment.

50
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,600
Would you like to start with Chris's letter of comment on croissants, Alison?

51
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,380
So we just have the one letter on the almond croissant episode, I believe,

52
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,720
but it was a very good one.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,860
It was from Christopher J. Garcia, who writes,

54
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,960
everywhere else is weird, but coffee shops in Santa Cruz County are correct.

55
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,900
Here, an almond croissant is a croissant made of almond flour.

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,360
My brain has exploded at this point.

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,700
They're also delightful.

58
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,220
This is true.

59
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,700
Cakes made of almond flour are very good.

60
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
So like seriously great.

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,940
The exterior is perfect.

62
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,060
And I very much hope at some point in the future,

63
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,900
I will be able to come to Santa Cruz County and test this theory for myself.

64
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,700
I think he also says that croissons are, as laminated pastries go, easier than elephant ears.

65
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,100
And as croissons turn out better with less attention, elephant ears go from delightful to weaponized in less than three seconds.

66
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,200
Elephant ears are a shoe bun.

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,740
So yes, I think that's pretty likely.

68
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,500
Thank you very much, Chris.

69
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,140
Your letter made my mouth water.

70
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,040
So there we go.

71
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,060
We heard from Farah Mendelsohn.

72
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,880
Actually, we heard from Farah a little while ago, but we've just about got around to doing this notice.

73
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:25,280
Farah writes that the Carol Goldman Fund, administered by Dream Foundry, has funds to support the attendance of Palestinian fans, writers, artists, etc.

74
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,020
The money has been dispersed for 2025.

75
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:36,560
But in 2026, it will be directed to support Palestinian fans, writers and artists to attend Eurocon in Berlin, which is MetropolCon.

76
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,600
You should contact Dream Foundry for details if you are eligible, or that's the link to spread if you would like to spread the word further.

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,240
And it is in our show notes.

78
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,520
Thank you very much, Farah.

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,920
We'll put a link to MetropolCon in the show notes as well.

80
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you very much to Ming-Louis for writing in.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,320
And now I know how to pronounce his surname.

82
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,500
And I'll put a link in the show notes so everyone else can learn too.

83
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,320
We heard from Raj on the subject of our live episode from Reconnect, and we didn't come to this last time.

84
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,540
He says that he was almost disappointed with how coherent the live episode was.

85
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,980
And so clearly the solution here is more beer.

86
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,760
Raj doesn't suggest the more beer.

87
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,800
I'm editorialising that on the end.

88
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,560
Raj just opined.

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,240
I mean, we could say that the solutions are clearly more beer or having COVID.

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,660
So I think we should try more beer first.

91
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:35,440
That's a noted biostatistician, no, bioinformatician Liz Batty with her medical knowledge.

92
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,940
Correlation is not causation, obviously.

93
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,500
We also heard from Tammy Coxon on Blue Sky.

94
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:53,720
Thank you to Tammy for writing us in and thanking us for our nuanced discussion of the whole Worldcon AI thing on the previous episode.

95
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,140
We got very few letters on that, which makes me believe that we were maybe...

96
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,400
Were we too nuanced?

97
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,840
Do you want more hot takes?

98
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,760
Let us know.

99
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,020
Same number of takes per totter, presumably.

100
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,380
Spicy takes.

101
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,740
Spicy.

102
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
I've only got so many takes in me.

103
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,980
But then we have a pre-show, because we have a pre-show where we start doing the spicy thing,

104
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,460
and this tells us to stop having an argument or she'll take off her headphones and go away.

105
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,580
There was a very specific situation where I would do that.

106
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,680
Which this is linked to, yeah?

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,340
Yes.

108
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:30,020
I mean, I think I said, Alison and John, if you're going to have a big Barney about AI, I'm going to take my headphones and wander off for 10 minutes.

109
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,420
Seems perfectly reasonable.

110
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:39,160
On Facebook, we heard from Jan Harley, who, you know, noticed that our last episode was a little bit late,

111
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,200
but she hadn't missed our lovely voices because they're catching up on the back catalogue and just got to the end of number 73.

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,600
I do hope the concerns about the 2023 Worldcon at that time weren't justified.

113
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,080
Hmm.

114
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,660
Spoilers.

115
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,440
Yeah.

116
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,260
I mean, I think this is time for our regular disclaimer that we do not recommend starting from the beginning,

117
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,200
not least because we may have been completely wrong about something and had it all come back to bite us.

118
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,660
If that's the case, please don't tell us.

119
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,400
Don't write.

120
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,200
No, tell us.

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,680
That'd be funny.

122
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,300
Okay.

123
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes.

124
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,960
Agreed.

125
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,160
And we heard from Christopher J. Garcia.

126
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,700
This isn't Deja Vu because he also wrote in on episode 134.

127
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,860
And he says,

128
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:33,160
Do you know anything about the 2006 Worldcon?

129
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,120
It was Worldcon held in 2006.

130
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,620
Do you mean this is a deep cut about site selection?

131
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,040
I assume so.

132
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,740
Probably.

133
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,280
We should look it up.

134
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,120
He also says that the Arthur C. Clarke shortlist is pretty good and says I've earned a cookie.

135
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,740
Brilliant.

136
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,260
Yeah.

137
00:06:50,260 --> 00:07:00,400
So I am going to be very distressed if we discover that the Arthur C. Clarke shortlist for the first time in living memory does not have at least one book that causes everyone to go,

138
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,720
What on earth is that doing there?

139
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,680
I think it does have that book, but that book might differ for different commentators.

140
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,420
Which is actually always the case.

141
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,140
So that's quite good.

142
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,200
Yes.

143
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,900
Demonstration is a juried award and has scope for a jury with a range of views.

144
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,720
Yes.

145
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,840
Oh, I've, sorry, I've just gone back and looked up the 2008 Worldcon site selection.

146
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,840
So the one that was held in 2006 when I think I was not really paying attention to site selection.

147
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,860
So I did not remember that Denver won by 12 votes.

148
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,380
Oh, wow.

149
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,480
Wow.

150
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,660
Mmm.

151
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,600
So I've got a follow up question, Liz.

152
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,180
Yeah.

153
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,680
Was the 2008 Worldcon in Denver?

154
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,440
Yes.

155
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,120
Oh, intriguing.

156
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,820
I honestly don't know if that's a trick question.

157
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,640
Yes.

158
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,100
It wasn't.

159
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,960
I just didn't know that.

160
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,680
Fair enough.

161
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,340
I did not go.

162
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,520
I hear it was good, but...

163
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,740
Mile High Con?

164
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,040
No, it was called Denvention, I think.

165
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,080
Denvention.

166
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,660
Okay.

167
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,720
I've heard of Denvention.

168
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,440
But it was very high up, is all I remember, that there were people who went and said actually

169
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,260
the altitude was quite more of a thing than they expected.

170
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,100
Who knew?

171
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,180
Anyway, I'll pop that on the show notes.

172
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:20,760
We also had a lock from Ali Baker-Brooks, who wrote in on Reconnect, which was the 2025

173
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,960
Eastcon in Belfast.

174
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,300
Great con.

175
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,400
Amazing program.

176
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,760
wonderful to meet so many newer con people energised by Glasgow in 2024.

177
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,300
So yes, I agree with all of those things.

178
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,500
I think she says two things.

179
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,580
She says the con food was very good and very difficult for food restrictions.

180
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,840
And number two, it was a great venue for many things, but socially there wasn't a central hangout.

181
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,200
And we were going to talk about Eastcon anyway, but we are going to springboard into it with this.

182
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,760
What do we think on those two criticisms?

183
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Well, she's not wrong on the food.

184
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,960
People who ate in the hotel restaurant, I think, thought it was quite good and quite good value.

185
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,140
But there was an issue around cheaper food, such as you might like to pick up a baguette or a snack.

186
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,860
I feel like for the hours when it was open, there was a Cafe Nero very close to the hotel.

187
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,080
And that was quite a good source of, you know, the sort of things they sell at Cafe Nero.

188
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,100
But when you're kind of saying, well, Cafe Nero is a great choice for con food,

189
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,860
I think that's an indication that there's a problem there.

190
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,520
And if you had a little bit more time to spend, then for some of the time,

191
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,900
St. George's Market was open and had fabulous food of many sorts.

192
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,160
And for some of the time, there was a chip shop.

193
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,000
And apparently that was very good if what you wanted to eat was fish and chips,

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,360
which I personally often do, but other people might not.

195
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,080
But so it was pretty limited.

196
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,940
That was an issue.

197
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,920
I didn't really notice this because we had amazing breakfast in our hotel

198
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,840
and then we didn't eat again until going out to dinner every night.

199
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,180
So I understand that I'm speaking from a place of privilege here.

200
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,600
But I therefore didn't notice that there weren't very many cheap con food options.

201
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,280
I think there was a lack of like stuff you could pick up and take away.

202
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,840
Did eat in the hotel restaurant and I had some very nice like vegetable soup and a baguette,

203
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,920
which was reasonably priced.

204
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:17,940
But then you had to have half an hour free to queue up to order it and then sit down and wave at someone

205
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,840
and hope they'd remembered where you were sitting to get it.

206
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,740
There wasn't sort of a, oh, I'll go and pick up like a sizable baguette option,

207
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,120
apart from a very few that were in the convention center.

208
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,440
I mean, I thought having St. George's Market was amazing.

209
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,660
The food there was so good and tasty and pretty cheap.

210
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,320
And, you know, you didn't need that long to go and go and snag some.

211
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,940
But there are people who can't get out of the hotel and convention center at convenient times.

212
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,060
And St. George's Market is not open on a Sunday or bank holidays.

213
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,220
So, yeah.

214
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,380
I went to the Nero a few times and I very rarely saw anyone from the con in it.

215
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,300
So maybe we needed a big sign saying there is a Nero over here if you need a panini.

216
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,860
Yeah, I mean, obviously a cafe Nero panini was a much better option than not being able to get a sandwich in the hotel.

217
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:11,940
But again, it's only open in the daytime and convention workers in particular tend to need food at quite a variety of times of day.

218
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,500
So, yes, Belfast was great for food generally, but the con food was not always the best.

219
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,420
I want to say I think these are reasonable comments.

220
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,760
I am curious as to the extent to which this is worse or better than other Eastcom venues that we've been at previously.

221
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,180
I think it's tricky, right?

222
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,580
Because Belfast in some ways was much better from a food perspective because it was in Belfast.

223
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:46,040
And especially like if you're at the NEC, your options to go and find other food might be more limited than it is in a city that's a capital city.

224
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,500
And so, yes, I don't know.

225
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:57,300
I think that's got to be part of the consideration because like the NEC food venues get very busy in the evenings, much more than the Belfast ones were doing.

226
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,980
As far as I could tell anyway, from my experience of waiting in both places.

227
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,760
And so it's probably true that the at venue stuff was not very good.

228
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,360
But the fact that you have it in a capital city, I think, changes the conversation a little bit, I would say.

229
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,280
I did think that being five minutes walk from the centre of a capital city was pretty good generally.

230
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,240
And that's actually something that is a benefit for Easter cons.

231
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,500
It would be nice if we could hold more of them in cities.

232
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,620
I know it's difficult.

233
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,680
Yeah, I think it's a trade off.

234
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,260
I mean, I think we've certainly had better and worse cons food wise.

235
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,120
I did like the last NEC one where they got the food trucks.

236
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,880
The food trucks were good.

237
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,740
The food trucks make a big difference too.

238
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,520
I don't think it was logistically possible to park one is a problem.

239
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:51,600
But I think a lot of the complaints on this one would have been solved by one food truck doing like flatbreads with hummus in and kebabs, basically.

240
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,140
And that seems like, yeah, we are making trade offs, but there might be room to solve those.

241
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:04,320
Whereas there are some places where like if you're so far out of town that you can't go anywhere and get any decent food in the evening, then you can't really solve that as easily.

242
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,060
I did think that Belfast shuts down more over the Easter weekend than a lot of places we've been.

243
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,800
There are a lot more places that seem to close very early on Sundays or were kind of closed on the bank holiday.

244
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,480
It is a long time since we've been to Liverpool for an Easter con.

245
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:28,220
But one of the things about Liverpool for the Easter con was that we would spend some energy in trying to persuade local bars and restaurants to stay open.

246
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,840
I mean, before the weekend, we would go in and say, we are doing this.

247
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,080
People will want to eat.

248
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:39,120
If you are open on Good Friday and Easter Monday and Easter Sunday, then things will be better for you.

249
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,380
I think things have changed a bit.

250
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,920
People say Belfast is a lot more open over the weekend than it was 10 or 20 years ago.

251
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,140
And I well believe that.

252
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:53,100
Well, when we were sort of discussing in committee, one of the committee members was like, remember, everything will be shut on Sunday.

253
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,080
It will be a nightmare.

254
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,840
And then I went out and ate and drank on Sunday.

255
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,700
And I was like, this seems to be a very pleasant nightmare, which I'm quite enjoying, really.

256
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,340
And so I think you're probably right.

257
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:11,980
I think my impression and especially my impression from talking to people in Belfast is that it's changed quite a lot since Covid.

258
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:21,900
And I wonder whether the shock of everything forcibly going away for a while made the restaurants think, well, if we open on Sundays, we'd get we might be able to get some more money and that might be quite helpful.

259
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,980
And then other people are like, oh, going out on Sundays is quite nice, isn't it?

260
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,800
I believe Belfast City Council also changed some.

261
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,640
Possibly, possibly some rules.

262
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,360
They made it they definitely made it easier for people to open over the Easter weekend.

263
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,880
Well, that's the other thing.

264
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:43,960
Having been in Vienna a week later on a on May Day on May Day, supermarkets don't open in Austria.

265
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,260
And on Sundays, supermarkets don't open in Austria.

266
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,740
So like Belfast is very open compared to some places in Europe.

267
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,780
So Ali also talks about social hubs.

268
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,020
What were our thoughts on that?

269
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:07,280
I was quite surprised to see this because and I understand that I like bars, but I thought that the Hilton bar was placed almost exactly equidistant from both chunks of programme space.

270
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,800
So it was, in fact, a central location.

271
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:17,300
And you could either walk one way through to the conference centre or the other way up to the Hilton's programme spaces.

272
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,820
And it kind of seemed fine to me.

273
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,140
And I spent quite a lot of time there.

274
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,900
Maybe not quite as much as I like because some of the time it was a bit kind of noisy and full.

275
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,180
But most of the time it was great as a central space.

276
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:37,260
There was also kind of there were kind of rather impersonal lobbies for both of the for both of the sets of conference space.

277
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,620
But I'm not sure either of those are really great hangout spaces.

278
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,000
They were good places to sort of rest for a little while between items.

279
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,420
So I think, yeah, I agree with Alison in part.

280
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,020
I don't think the space was quite equidistant from the two sides of the convention because I think it probably was closer to the Hilton than the ICC.

281
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,920
But it was relatively marginal.

282
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,680
And I think in general it had quite a good central space for that.

283
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,800
But I will also say I'm not sure I'm I've never been a huge fan of conventions that only have one obvious social area.

284
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,480
I quite like having a mixture of places to hang out and catch up with people.

285
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:24,120
Yeah, I think it felt like the Hilton social space was good, but it was probably a bit far from the convention center to be the obvious social space if you wanted to hang out there.

286
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,440
And the convention center social spaces were a bit not.

287
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,120
They're a bit sort of sterile and convention centery.

288
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,960
There was only that really that one area outside the art show that it had sort of tables and chairs could hang out in.

289
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,360
Then there were some other kind of scattered sofas, which I did like.

290
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,820
But then downstairs at registration where there were some, you know, there were some kind of displays and stuff on.

291
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,780
I think Blood on the Clock Tower was played down there.

292
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,500
It's a shame there wasn't a bit more sort of like social space hangouty stuff that you could do down there.

293
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,920
I think that's obviously going to be a problem with any site that's a convention center hotel split.

294
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:06,780
But in general, I thought the ICC Hilton worked really well as a convention site.

295
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:14,220
Obviously, I suspect if stairs are a problem for you as an access thing, then having to get the lift from one to the other was probably a bit of a pain in the neck.

296
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,460
But I don't know if anyone listening has opinions on that.

297
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,520
Please do write in because I'd be interested to learn.

298
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,260
Well, I have some opinions on this because I use the lifts all weekend.

299
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,840
Oh.

300
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:30,420
Which is, I think, the first time at an Easter con I've really felt, oh, yeah, that's going to make it a lot easier for me.

301
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,180
And they were fine.

302
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:39,800
And that's maybe why I think it's a bit more equidistant because there was just one little lift to get down to the conference center or up.

303
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,540
I'm not quite sure.

304
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,000
There was one lift that took you one floor to get from the Hilton to the conference center.

305
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,620
That was normally empty.

306
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,860
And there was the main Hilton lifts.

307
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,060
There was normally a not very long queue for.

308
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,540
So it was fine.

309
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,200
But they were quite slow because as well as serving the mezzanine.

310
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,560
I mean, that felt like a hotel that really needed escalators up to the mezzanine, which would certainly have it, but was built now or made in America.

311
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,660
Yeah.

312
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,700
Rather than that big staircase in the lobby.

313
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,020
So you were reliant on the Hilton lifts.

314
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:19,580
And they were kind of if you were trying to get up to a program item at a point when there were like a lot of people going back and forth to their rooms.

315
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,940
It could take quite a long time.

316
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:33,300
Nowadays, hotels like that are built with escalators up to the mezzanine and then lifts that will take you to the bedroom floors because of this exact problem, especially if they've got a lot of conference space.

317
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,560
But if they had escalators, then you couldn't use the stairs for photo shoots.

318
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,740
As I did see one day.

319
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,900
Okay.

320
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:50,640
I mean, you know, I kind of think of both stairs and escalators have been primarily to move people around a building rather than to provide Instagram backdrops.

321
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,760
But what do I know?

322
00:18:51,760 --> 00:19:00,340
Oh, the other thing I know, the other thing I wanted to say about the layout, which is in general, it was all fine, except there were program rooms called the boardroom.

323
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,480
In both the Hilton and the conference center and nothing was done to distinguish these.

324
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,700
So I turned up for at least one program item in the wrong one and went, oh, no.

325
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,340
And of course, by the time I got over to the other one, which took quite a long time, it was full.

326
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,360
So, boo.

327
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah.

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,460
So I thought the convention would quite well from a flow perspective.

329
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,800
So, yeah, it was nice to look around.

330
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,700
Look around?

331
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,920
Nice to walk around.

332
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,660
I also really liked that the art show and the fan tables were next to each other and there was like a place you could hang out there.

333
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,060
I think that felt very good.

334
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,240
And I think part of the problem here is that, like, it's tricky, right?

335
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,820
Because on this podcast, we do a lot of critiquing conventions.

336
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,060
And I think it's good and wise to critique conventions.

337
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:50,700
But honestly, I'm just absolutely thrilled when we get a new venue for EasterCon that looks like it works even 60% well.

338
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,200
Because it's not like we're drowning in great candidate sites.

339
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,560
So the food thing, I think, like, that's an access issue and needs to be taken seriously.

340
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,100
But, yeah, if the bar's in slightly the wrong place.

341
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,600
It's also a thing you can work on, right?

342
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,020
Like, if we went back to site and we said, hey, you know how you sold approximately 3,000 baguettes or something?

343
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,640
You know, because I think we do tend to eat on site quite a lot.

344
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,980
You know how you sold all these baguettes.

345
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,540
If you did it again, would you mind putting a vegan wall on?

346
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,840
You'll sell another 200.

347
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,760
Then that's a good starting point for negotiation.

348
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,660
Yeah, true.

349
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,740
And you can't ask them to move the bar around because that would involve, like, JCBs and stuff.

350
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:37,420
Yeah, I did wonder if where we erred in the bar is because it was a bit of a thoroughfare for getting between places and was sometimes very crowded.

351
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,420
Maybe we needed to keep a bit of a channel there so people could actually get through.

352
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:49,080
Because I'm sure I inadvertently stood in front of people and probably inadvertently stood in front of people in scooters who were trying to get around without going outside.

353
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,800
So that's another possible issue.

354
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,820
But yeah, generally, like, would we go back to Belfast?

355
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,480
Oh, God, yes, in a heartbeat.

356
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,940
Yeah, if it was a viable place to go, I would quite happily go back to that venue on an Easter weekend.

357
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,120
It was, I think, generally very good for Eastcom.

358
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:14,660
And do you think it ended up being more expensive, significantly more expensive than a mainland UK one or not so much?

359
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,660
You mean from the perspective of me going or from the perspective of the committee running it?

360
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:25,320
I mean, I mean, for the perspective of attendees, but it's completely, you know, the comparison doesn't work for me because I just flew to Ireland.

361
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,080
So I'm such an outlier, it doesn't matter.

362
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,180
But basically, are there people for whom this was a financial drag?

363
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:38,020
For me, it was one of the most expensive Easter cons I have been to, maybe ever.

364
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,400
Can I just say, can you, if you subtract the cocktails at the rattle bag from the cost of your weekend?

365
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,980
It is funny you should mention the cocktails at the rattle bag.

366
00:21:48,980 --> 00:22:00,800
But I had five, I think, excellent meals out and a whole bunch of cocktails that, and as a normal Easter con, I probably eat out once or twice.

367
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,800
So that's the difference of being in a big city, you know, at upscale restaurants.

368
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,400
So that's what being in a capital city gets.

369
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,220
So I felt like I had a bit of a Belfast city break.

370
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:20,180
And also I'd spent, you know, a small fortune in a cocktail bar, which I have never previously done at an Easter con, I don't think.

371
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,720
So apart from that, I think it was normal price.

372
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,380
No, no, me neither.

373
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,780
The NEC doesn't seem to have any amazing bougie cocktail bars.

374
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,880
I'm not sure why that is.

375
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,760
Yeah, because it's not, you know, Belfast's a capital city and you can tell.

376
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,760
And neither does Heathrow, strangely.

377
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,760
No, so it's interesting, right?

378
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:51,360
I think probably the cost of getting to Belfast by plane was more for me in Espana than it would have been to get the train down to most places that hold Easter cons.

379
00:22:51,360 --> 00:23:02,340
The cost of the hotel, I would say probably a little bit dear, but it's very difficult to tell because the insane things that have happened to hotel prices since COVID, like, is that just what it would have?

380
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,300
It's hard to work out.

381
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,980
In terms of, like, eating and drinking in Belfast, probably a little bit more expensive.

382
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:17,460
But I think the other thing is that because it was a capital city, we probably could if we'd needed to eat quite a lot cheaper than we did because you've got so many options.

383
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,720
And also the cocktails were delicious but not cheap.

384
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,320
But I certainly don't, it doesn't stick out as significantly more expensive to me, certainly.

385
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,720
I don't think it was cheaper, but it didn't seem extortionate compared to anywhere else.

386
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,220
You're in Newcastle.

387
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,460
I thought those cocktails were phenomenal value.

388
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,520
And I think quite a lot of the food that we ate was pretty good value as well.

389
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:48,240
Sure, but I could easily have spent £100 on drinks in that bar over two nights and that is rather more than my usual alcohol budget at an Easter con.

390
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,240
And so, although I'm not saying it was bad value, it was definitely higher outlay of money.

391
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,760
Yes, so the convention was expensive for me, but I think every single individual thing I purchased was good value for money.

392
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,980
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.

393
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,660
I think that's the point.

394
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,400
So I just had, I just ate and drank far better than I normally do.

395
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,640
And also I saved all my lunches, so I didn't have to spend any money on lunches.

396
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:22,540
I think you had, it sounds like there was a much higher discretionary spend, but in terms of travel and hotels, which are the kind of non-negotiable bit, it's not actually too much different than many bits of the UK.

397
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,120
If I wasn't staying in the main con hotel, and that's pretty unusual for me.

398
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,480
So it would have been £40 a night more in the convention hotel.

399
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,120
Although I think we probably have got about £40 less worth of breakfast, so that seems fine.

400
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,660
Not quite £40.

401
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:44,660
But again, like, it's a lot easier not to be in the con hotel in Belfast than it is, for instance.

402
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,600
I mean, Heathrow is actually pretty easy, but like, there are some venues where it's very difficult.

403
00:24:49,600 --> 00:25:01,420
Fewer than there used to be, because most of these airport and off-centre sites have got clusters of budget hotels around them now in a way that, again, they maybe didn't 20 years ago.

404
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,820
So, I mean, I think we're going to Glasgow in 27, and we're based in the Crowne Plaza.

405
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:12,340
The first time I went to the Crowne Plaza, there was one budget hotel within walking distance, whereas now I think there are dozens.

406
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,120
Fair.

407
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:26,280
Yeah, I mean, there's not quite dozens, but there's, you know, there are a sufficient number, and then if you count walking into the town centre as walking distance, which is a bit further than it was in Belfast, then they count as well.

408
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,660
So, that's the thing.

409
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,300
Like, when is the last time we went to a really, truly isolated Eastercon venue?

410
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,120
I don't think we have for quite a while.

411
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:34,940
Hinkley?

412
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,220
Yeah, we haven't been to Hinkley for like 20 years.

413
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,840
Yeah, before my time.

414
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,780
I'm going to look up the Eastercon venues and find out.

415
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,040
Bradford in 2013.

416
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,160
Yeah, all right.

417
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,880
Would be the last properly isolated one, I think.

418
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,180
Which one is that?

419
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,840
And even then, like, Bradford, the Cedar Court.

420
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,840
Yeah, no, but the Cedar Court has some fabulous curry houses within easy walking distance.

421
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,660
If you want to eat food that's not curry, it's a bit harder.

422
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,840
Yeah, but it doesn't have hotel, it doesn't have any hotels in walking distance.

423
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,560
Yeah.

424
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,780
And so they basically had to put on a bus for that to make other things viable.

425
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,980
I mean, I stayed in a fabulous Bradford hotel that I remember was incredibly cheap.

426
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:19,620
But, yeah, that hotel is really, truly, if you don't stay there, you are getting a bus or a taxi or walking a very long way.

427
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,040
But that is kind of the last one, right?

428
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,440
Like, Harrogate, there are a few in walking distance, including one in the car park, basically.

429
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,720
And we've been to Heathrow.

430
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,020
Telford had some.

431
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,940
Belfort's had them.

432
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,840
Birmingham has them.

433
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,340
Yeah.

434
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:37,200
I mean, and that changes your access and your cost conversation, right?

435
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,820
Because it means that you've got more options to suit what it is you need in an ideal world.

436
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,720
And obviously, like most conventions, I hesitate to say all conventions,

437
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,220
although I think the vast, vast majority will set rooms aside in the main con hotel for people with access needs.

438
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,460
But obviously, there is a conversation there about if those rooms cost more,

439
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,800
you also have to make sure you've got like a bursaries program or something to make that work,

440
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,120
because people may not be able to afford it otherwise.

441
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,420
But, you know, we do do bursary schemes and stuff.

442
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,160
So that is something we are doing.

443
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,680
Anything else on EasterCon?

444
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,100
If you're listening to this, then the EasterCon catch-up has closed.

445
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,760
I hope many of you listened to some because I totally forgot and did not.

446
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,640
I didn't listen to any catch-up.

447
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,380
So after last year, my life is going through one of its periodic busy times at the moment.

448
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,440
So, I don't know.

449
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,140
It's complicated.

450
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,540
It is, yeah.

451
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:41,380
So, like, I probably would have done if it wasn't for the fact that Easter was directly before one of the big conferences in my field.

452
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,760
So my time immediately afterwards has been extremely busy.

453
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,940
And that is atypical.

454
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,820
It's usually quite busy, but it's not usually quite as full on as it was this year.

455
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,600
So we can only really speak for three of us.

456
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:00,020
I would be interested to hear from anyone involved with Belfast how their catch-up went.

457
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,700
Yeah.

458
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,060
Like, did they actually get as many people logging in and watching stuff as before?

459
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,240
Because it seemed very quiet.

460
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,940
And also, the con Discord usually has kind of trickles of conversation after the con.

461
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,340
Although, admittedly, some of the time that is due to everyone reporting positive COVID tests.

462
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,820
And there was a bit less of that this year.

463
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,120
But it went very quiet very quickly.

464
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,880
And it didn't seem like there was all so much discussion of stuff people were watching.

465
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,640
I wonder if there is a thing where you could, you know, almost plan to have people posting in the Discord occasionally after the con saying,

466
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,120
Oh, I've just watched this and it was great.

467
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,780
And encourage that because then more people will remember that the catch-up is there.

468
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,140
And also, what are we doing with all these catch-ups?

469
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,220
Are we...

470
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,900
Didn't Telford save them to be...

471
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,520
Conversation sent them to be archived with places.

472
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,860
That Alison will now take as she was involved.

473
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,480
The Science Fiction Foundation and FanAct.org.

474
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,180
Both with sort of statements saying, available for researchers.

475
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,840
But please don't stick them on the internet.

476
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,760
And, yeah.

477
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,600
So, I think that's about as best as you could.

478
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,460
I do want this stuff to be systematically saved.

479
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,880
But it is quite hard unless you said that to your people when you started.

480
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,000
Which I think we did.

481
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,560
Yes.

482
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,520
I wonder if we should be...

483
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,680
All right.

484
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,000
It just occurred to me.

485
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:24,080
Should we be trying to identify a few items before the con where we would like to not only save them,

486
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,560
but maybe put them up publicly later on?

487
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,400
As a sort of taster of, if you like this program item, why don't you come to next year's Easter con?

488
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,740
There'll be another hundred of them.

489
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,240
Yeah.

490
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,040
So, I think you could...

491
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,340
I've not really thought about this.

492
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,600
And, like, you know, this is definitely a stretch goal for future conventions.

493
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,760
But there's no reason you couldn't say to people, are you happy to be streamed?

494
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,360
Are you happy to be on the catch-up for members only?

495
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,100
Are you happy to be on the internet publicly?

496
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,320
And separate that out as a separate thing.

497
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,300
And then, you know, if you do have panels where people are happy to...

498
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,620
Where everyone was happy to be on the internet publicly, you could consider those as tasters if you wanted to.

499
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,840
The only thing I worry is if you have that tick box, does it make people more reluctant to tick the other tick boxes?

500
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,060
Because psychology is a funny old thing.

501
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,480
Yeah, I think maybe you do it kind of preemptively.

502
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,100
You, in fact, contact all the people.

503
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,920
You know, you identify some likely candidates.

504
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,800
Or maybe you look at, like, the guest of honour interviews or something and talk to people on them and say,

505
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,260
actually, would you be happy to do this?

506
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,340
Totally optional.

507
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,640
No problem if you say no.

508
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,020
But just, it occurs to me, it's like, it's a nice thing.

509
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,700
And we might be able to use it to be a sort of, you know, little bit of publicity for us.

510
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,960
And also give people on the internet some more content, but not give away the whole thing so that people have to join and watch it.

511
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,580
There you go.

512
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,300
Idea for you for free future Easter cons, which I'm not going to do any work for.

513
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:43,980
Have fun.

514
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,600
Yeah, no, I feel this is all part of future Easter cons.

515
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,940
Take note because I'm not sure I'm ever going to run another one.

516
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,340
So.

517
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,120
Do we have anything else on Easter con?

518
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:58,560
So one of the reasons I had a very expensive Easter con was that I spent an enormous amount of money in the cocktail bar in our hotel.

519
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,880
And that cocktail bar, Rattlebag, has just won an award for best bar in Northern Ireland.

520
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,840
So you see, it's not just us who liked it.

521
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,460
Yeah.

522
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,460
It was phenomenal.

523
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,080
Worth going to Belfast for, I'd say, if you like cocktails.

524
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,880
I will.

525
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,040
Yeah, I would say if I ever went to Belfast again, I would be making a trip specifically there.

526
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,400
There were other places I'd go as well.

527
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,960
I'd go to Raging Ramen again because that was great.

528
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,380
But yeah, no, I would consider it to be a place you should visit if you go.

529
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:33,700
Since Easter, I have twice been out with people and they have called out a cocktail bar to me and said,

530
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,000
I used to really like that one, but now it just seems tawdry.

531
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,860
So, you know, it might spoil you.

532
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,160
Rattlebag might spoil you for Commodore Garden cocktail bars.

533
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,960
I had a chilli mango frozen margarita for $2.50.

534
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,900
So I have not been spoiled.

535
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:56,900
There is a place in Newcastle called Little Lobo and they were doing chilli margaritas and they were fucking excellent.

536
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,580
So, you know.

537
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,340
Other cocktail bars are available.

538
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,120
I've never had a martini as good as the one I had at Rattlebag though.

539
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,820
So like, you know, it is, it's very good.

540
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,140
Oh, the cacao infused boulevardier that wasn't on the menu because we got to the point where we drunk all the cocktails on the menu.

541
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,800
So they had to suggest other things to us.

542
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,140
Yes, we did that when we went with Tammy Cox and we did the words.

543
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,420
I think we mentioned that in the live episode.

544
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:33,200
Something we did mention in the live episode because it hadn't happened yet is that Tommy and James commissioned some lovely sort of spirits glasses with the Reconnect logo etched into the sides for the committee.

545
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,200
And I christened mine with Pusheen and ginger ale, which was very lovely.

546
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,280
Thank you very much to Tommy and James for that gift.

547
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,460
And it goes in the dishwasher because it's etched.

548
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,120
So just fantastic choices all round.

549
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,940
And I don't know if we talked about this on the live episode, but I wanted to talk about games.

550
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,960
When do you not want to talk about games?

551
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,220
Games at the EasterCon or games generally?

552
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,460
Games at the EasterCon.

553
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:07,160
So I, this EasterCon is the first EasterCon I remember having role-playing games and social deduction games on the program as actual programmed items.

554
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,340
And I thought that was wonderful.

555
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,360
I think it went, I think it worked really well.

556
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,700
I think, I thought the games room was pretty good.

557
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,940
It was run for them by a local game shop with volunteers.

558
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,340
Yes, I think this is a very good wheeze.

559
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:29,740
And I think that is a good wheeze, but I think kind of my family walked in and they immediately suggested a stupid party game for us to play,

560
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:38,020
which probably wouldn't be a likely choice for any family at the EasterCon, but certainly wasn't really a very good choice for us.

561
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,620
And then we found a kind of headbanging numbery game.

562
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,860
And so I did, I did play a stupid party game the other day that I liked.

563
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,700
But, but no, so I thought it was a really good idea.

564
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,880
And I think that probably is a good model that works quite well.

565
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:59,860
If you can get a game shop that is attached to a games club who will all come in and volunteer in return for their badges and wouldn't otherwise be at the con.

566
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,320
Like a good bet to me.

567
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,520
It ran on weekend.

568
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,180
It was pretty good.

569
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,140
They had quite a lot of games, including, you know, I mean, I like games rooms generally.

570
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,220
So, you know, I thought this one was fine.

571
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:21,520
I think having a games club run the games room was very good because I think it divorced the games room from the culture of games rooms at Eastercons.

572
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:32,800
And I think that was good because as someone who very much likes games, but finds the games room at Eastercon has been sometimes extremely insular and not very welcoming.

573
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:40,260
I think having a company come in that didn't have that baggage, but did love games, who was like just happy to run games and be gamers.

574
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,600
That was very nice.

575
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,860
Yeah, I thought the games room worked very well.

576
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:49,340
And it was interesting to me in the light of like the Zucon run we did at Glasgow, where that's one of the scenarios.

577
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:57,540
Like I actually thought having the dealer in the dealer's room who was selling games be the same people that were running the games room was nice.

578
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,940
Because obviously that means that if you play games in the game room, they might be able to sell it to you in the dealer's room.

579
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,420
And yeah, there's there's some interesting.

580
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,360
I thought being able to sell them to you straight there in the game room was a perfectly good idea.

581
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,660
It also works.

582
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,240
Yeah.

583
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,560
Yeah.

584
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:10,720
Yeah.

585
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:19,160
Because Glasgow did this West End Games, which is based in Glasgow, ran a bunch of the gaming at the Glasgow Worldcon.

586
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,200
And I would quite like to see Eastercons pursue this more vigorously, because I think it might be an absolutely fantastic idea.

587
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,260
But I also think it might mean that you introduce the gaming communities in various cities to Eastercon.

588
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,740
And then they might tell people about Eastercon.

589
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,620
So I think it might also be advertising listeners.

590
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:50,200
It has an issue, which is that we have a bunch of other areas of the convention where it would be possible to give people privileged access to sell to our members in return for them doing something for the con.

591
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,100
And we tend to not do that because we've had bad experiences, obviously, in the past, but probably a very long time ago.

592
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,740
So this might not matter.

593
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:09,840
When also, I think part of the thing is that to run a good games room, you need a good games library and asking a member to bring a good games library and stay in the games room all weekend is very different to asking like a local games cafe to do it.

594
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,360
So I think that's another element.

595
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,080
But this is because this is also largely how games conventions do it.

596
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:30,140
Not entirely, but you'll often see at games conventions that you'll often see at games conventions that like shops run or not shops necessarily, but cafes run the board game library.

597
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,100
Yeah.

598
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:31,840
Yeah.

599
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:44,260
I mean, I think the thing we are that specifically happened at Belfast is that it wouldn't be feasible really for the people who normally do the provide a library of games to do it because it was in Belfast.

600
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,300
And so that might have meant by necessity.

601
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,860
We have to go and talk to someone who doesn't need to bring them across the ocean.

602
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:58,100
I noticed there are also snag tights were dealing at Belfast, which is a very nice idea, but I don't think they actually had much stock.

603
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:08,040
They were sort of there in a sort of more promotional way and to talk to people and to come back next year because it wasn't really feasible for them to bring a whole load of tights in different sizes over to Belfast.

604
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:15,100
And that might also be the case, actually, that selling may not be the solution for them for East to come, but they did have a lovely time.

605
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,020
So, yeah.

606
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,740
So it's interesting.

607
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,240
So I would be, I mean, I have a feeling that we've done this with a games shop before, but can't remember.

608
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,940
But I think what it sold was presumably the games company.

609
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:37,940
Well, I hope they did well out of it because what I wonder is whether we've talked to the games shops and cafes before, but they haven't known if it would actually be a viable thing for them to do.

610
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,080
Because they don't know like what the arrangements are between do we guarantee them sales?

611
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,520
Did they just come along knowing they'd sell some games on a quiet weekend for them, etc.

612
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,060
Yeah, I went in the games room.

613
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,880
We played some games.

614
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,380
I think they made pretty reasonable suggestions for us.

615
00:37:51,380 --> 00:38:00,040
Although I think, yeah, maybe they were occasionally pitching it at like a slightly lower level than they might have if it was a games convention.

616
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,900
And there were people who were happy to play reasonably serious games quite late at night.

617
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,020
But we played some good games.

618
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,520
Probably depended who you got.

619
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:13,860
I think it very much depends because like, yeah, if they had suggested stupid party games to me, I'd have been like, yes, please.

620
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,640
And like I play crunchy games, but I also like stupid party games.

621
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,400
Like it's a it's not so much.

622
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,560
I don't think I always want to play super complex games at conventions.

623
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,960
Neither do I always want to play super uncomplex games at conventions.

624
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,200
So like my my taste expresses multitudes.

625
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,240
Oh, yeah.

626
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,560
Like sometimes I'm totally happy to play silly games.

627
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,520
As long as I can cast a fireball in a game at some point.

628
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,920
I think it's more just making sure like maybe they get just making sure they pitch it correctly.

629
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,820
We played the flow board game.

630
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,620
Is that good?

631
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:55,920
I still haven't seen the film, but I am informed it is as tense as the film, because basically at any time you're trying to build like little walkways for your animals.

632
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,000
And any time a wave can come and sweep them away and you have to start all over again.

633
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,940
And it is timed.

634
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,540
Oh, that sounds very that sounds very stressful.

635
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,920
Yes, that sounds much more stressful than I found the film.

636
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,760
Have you played Magic Maze?

637
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,020
Have I played Magic Maze?

638
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,620
No.

639
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:18,820
Magic Maze is a real time timed game where you're like a group of magic users trying to get through a maze, which is set in a shopping center for some reason.

640
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,680
But you're not allowed to talk.

641
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,580
You can only use gestures and each of you can only move the characters in certain directions.

642
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:32,140
And so you've got to do it all in real time just by like staring at each other meaningfully.

643
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,780
And it's very stressful, but it's very good.

644
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,100
And I very much like it.

645
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,660
So maybe I would very much like Flow 2.

646
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,060
So it's basically the opposite of Space Team.

647
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,580
In that it's individuals on the ground.

648
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:50,660
No, in that it's silent rather than Space Team, which is basically the loudest game it is possible to play.

649
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,460
Yes.

650
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,360
Yes.

651
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,400
All the stress of Space Team with none of the noise.

652
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,020
Yeah.

653
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,080
Oh, that sounds good.

654
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,700
It is.

655
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,780
It is good.

656
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,040
Not everyone likes it.

657
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,220
Some people find it extremely stressful.

658
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,100
I have added it to my wish list.

659
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,160
Oh, your wish list.

660
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,960
Seattle 2025 is on the horizon.

661
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,360
And we're going to talk a little bit about some things about that.

662
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,080
One of the things we're going to talk about is the consultative vote on issues pertaining to WUSPUS.

663
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,020
So there are two consultative votes this year.

664
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:33,340
There's a consultative vote on ratifying the amendment to abolish the Retro Hugo Awards.

665
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:40,200
And there's a consultative vote on ratifying proposed revisions of Hugo Award categories for Best Pro and Best Fan Artist.

666
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,300
What do we think about these?

667
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,520
By the way, you've missed the deadline, listeners.

668
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,780
It was at the end of May.

669
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,320
The thing opened for May and May was really busy.

670
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,100
So we didn't talk about it.

671
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,980
I'm not clear why it needed to stop at the end of May.

672
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,280
And maybe we could discuss that a little bit.

673
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,160
Because the first business meeting is on July the 4th.

674
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,380
Yep. So why does it need to stop by May?

675
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,760
If that whole thing is just to get an indication of where members are at,

676
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,260
it seems like you could wrap it up basically any time before that first meeting and it'd be fine.

677
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,700
But I don't know whether you two agree.

678
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,320
I think they still format agendas in extremely old-fashioned ways.

679
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,920
And they'd wait some weeks to do it.

680
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,020
Ready for printing.

681
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,200
But the consultative won't be in the agendas.

682
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,320
Okay. No, okay. That may make no sense then.

683
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:32,180
I do have a strong opinion on the division of artist one,

684
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,840
which is that it is possible that artists does need some revision,

685
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,960
but this is definitely not the way to do it.

686
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,840
And I thought, I think the no explanation was given by Richard Mann,

687
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,880
and I agree with almost every word of that.

688
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,580
I basically agree.

689
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,400
I think I can see why this was introduced.

690
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,140
I mean, I will note it was struck down in Chicago,

691
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,940
and a very similar thing was brought to Glasgow.

692
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,220
And I guess they're going to keep going until they get it through.

693
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,300
But I am not sure that this is how it needs to be changed,

694
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,280
if it needs to be changed, which I agree it might well need to be changed.

695
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,560
But I'm not convinced this is it.

696
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,460
Well, I mean, they're basically saying that work in fan artist cannot be sold,

697
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,200
which seems outrageous.

698
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,140
Just outrageous.

699
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,900
You know.

700
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,260
It's tricky, isn't it?

701
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,640
Because if we sold episodes of the podcast,

702
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,500
that would be disqualifying, and that's fair.

703
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,160
But art is a bit different for historic reasons.

704
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,600
No, but isn't there a one quarter of your income thing for the fan categories,

705
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,120
which is problematic in itself, but differently problematic.

706
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,320
So they're not suggesting.

707
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,700
But saying it cannot provide more than one quarter of your income would be a start,

708
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,860
which would be fine for fan artists,

709
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,840
because I'm sure there aren't any fan artists who are making,

710
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,840
you know, there's not much money in it, guys.

711
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,940
No, I think I agree.

712
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,840
I think there are probably things that might want to be tweaked,

713
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,260
but I'm not sure this is how you tweak them.

714
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,660
Liz, what do you reckon?

715
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,220
I mean, I don't have strong feelings about the art category,

716
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,080
because I don't do any art.

717
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,120
I do see, I think what they're trying to do is, you know,

718
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,760
I think they're trying to clarify things a bit,

719
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,640
other than like, you know, fan art is vibes or whatever,

720
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,300
which I do agree with.

721
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,700
But I don't really personally have an opinion on where you should draw the line,

722
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,460
because I'm not drawing the line.

723
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,140
Basically, I think what it knocks out of fan artists

724
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,040
is the sort of fan artist who will do you a, you know,

725
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,600
do you a headshot of your D&D character for $25 or whatever,

726
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,800
which arguably, yeah, if you did it by an income threshold instead,

727
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,200
would be in fan artist rather than pro artist.

728
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,500
Seems like a better fit, but I'm not sure we're nominating those.

729
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,980
Those people who fall into that category are not really getting nominated

730
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,460
for best fan artist at the moment anyway.

731
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,040
I'm not sure.

732
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,600
So yeah, I will point out that the things in the consultative vote

733
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,920
are things that were passed by 2024 and are being ratified by 2025.

734
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,860
So they've already passed one hurdle, and this is just the second hurdle.

735
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,620
Do you think that consultative votes should be used primarily for ratifications,

736
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,880
or do you think they should be used before that?

737
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,320
Because so far, the ones we've done have been for the best indie film, Hugo,

738
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,600
for these two, and I'm sure there was another one that I'm forgetting.

739
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,440
And that has all been ratification as far as I remember.

740
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,480
So do we think that's how this tool should be deployed, or what do we reckon?

741
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,600
I think that's the only way you can deploy it realistically, because the timeline,

742
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,560
like, so the deadline for submitting motions of business meetings is always a month before,

743
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,940
and then you would have to look at those, select some for consultative votes,

744
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,040
and run the consultative vote in that month, which is a pretty busy month

745
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,400
if you are following the normal schedule of the business meetings actually at the Worldcon.

746
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,380
So it seems like it's something that they can do a kind of consultation on,

747
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,540
and you can sort of view it as, well, the business meeting has passed this,

748
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,220
let us also take the temperature of this year's membership as a whole on it,

749
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:05,120
and you can do it early enough that it doesn't interfere in a very, very busy time for the Hugos.

750
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,820
Sorry, for the WSFUS division.

751
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:13,360
Having said that, this one, I'm not sure why this one needs to cut off in May, as we said,

752
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,380
because the results won't be out in time to...

753
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,120
And the other consultative vote is on just basically abolishing the retro Hugos.

754
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,500
So I say, yes, let's abolish the retro Hugos.

755
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,360
It's time.

756
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,300
I was persuaded by Fiona Moore's counter-argument on that,

757
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,820
which is basically, we only need to do seven more, and then it goes away anyway,

758
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,160
so let's just carry on.

759
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,800
And I was like, eh, fair.

760
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,620
I thought that was not a bad counter-argument,

761
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,640
but I was also worried that if it wasn't killed,

762
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,720
then people would start inventing new reasons to give out new old awards,

763
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,120
and it's just...

764
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,900
So, yeah, no, get rid of them.

765
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,040
So we were split. We were split.

766
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,860
I mean, if we don't get rid of them,

767
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:55,480
I will therefore only complain in seven more years, I guess.

768
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,700
The issue being that if we only have to do them seven more times,

769
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,920
but if one of the current cons chooses not to run the retros,

770
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,640
then they'll come back around in 25 years.

771
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,300
Yep.

772
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,360
And when we're doing the episode of Octop in 25 years, Liz,

773
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,460
it will give us something to talk about.

774
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,180
That's fair.

775
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:17,040
I mean, I was torn on it, and I think I actually might not have cast a vote,

776
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,720
because I was like, I'm not sure I care enough either way.

777
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,680
I would like to say that on the Seattle website,

778
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,800
it says that Wusfus is pronounced Wizzfizz.

779
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,680
What?

780
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,400
Yeah, so I've just noticed this.

781
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,560
If you go to the Wusfus page on Seattle,

782
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,880
it says it's known as Wusfus,

783
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,300
and then in brackets it says,

784
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,740
open quotation marks,

785
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,980
Wizz, spelt W-H-I-Z,

786
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,960
hyphen,

787
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,580
Fizz,

788
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,080
spelt as in a fizzy drink.

789
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,440
Closed quotation marks.

790
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,300
And I'm like, no, it's Wussfus,

791
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,680
as in Wuss,

792
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,320
W-U-S-S,

793
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,300
Fuss,

794
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,340
F-U-S-S.

795
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,700
But not Wussfuss.

796
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,840
Not Wussfuss.

797
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,500
That would be silly.

798
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:54,940
Wussfuss.

799
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,780
Wussfuss.

800
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,640
Not Wussfuss or Wizzfizz?

801
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,620
Wussfuss.

802
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,540
Yeah, does anyone pronounce it Wizzfizz?

803
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,000
I'm outraged.

804
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,500
I said something weird about American,

805
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,640
the lack of vowels in American English again,

806
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,000
where distinctions just don't happen in some dialects,

807
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,880
but I'm not sure this is one of them.

808
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,060
The problem with saying about American English

809
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,760
is obviously that there's quite a lot of different vowel sounds

810
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,680
in American English.

811
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,360
Absolutely.

812
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,900
Yeah, but there are some dialects of American English

813
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,860
that have fewer distinctions between vowel sounds

814
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,180
than you would normally expect.

815
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,780
What I would now like to do is ask Andy Openshaw

816
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,040
to record himself saying this

817
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,460
and send it in so I can splice it in next episode

818
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,600
so we can get the Geordie dialect

819
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,360
because I think that might be quite fun.

820
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,040
Sure.

821
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,360
What, Wussfuss?

822
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,060
Yeah.

823
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,520
W-U-S-F-I-E-I.

824
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,160
That's what I think it's pronounced.

825
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,140
Oh, I think we should just please,

826
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,820
everyone who listens to us,

827
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,700
please send,

828
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,220
please send a short MP3 of you saying the word Wussfuss

829
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,400
in the way that you pronounce it.

830
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,380
Yes, everyone,

831
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,240
every listener,

832
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,160
every listener write in

833
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,520
and then we'll put it together in a big smorgasbord.

834
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,700
Yes, please.

835
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,500
Yes.

836
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,560
And I've been studying Swedish

837
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,780
because I'm going to our Capella Con next month.

838
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,520
Sorry.

839
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,000
I had some jam.

840
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,780
Liz, what's your non-secreture?

841
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,520
And it turns out that smorgasbord means sandwich table,

842
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,220
which is way less exciting than my concept of what smorgasbord means.

843
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,400
Oh, I mean,

844
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,720
I think that if I showed you a big pile of gold

845
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,000
or a big pile of sandwiches,

846
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,960
one of those would excite you more than the other.

847
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,000
I think the only way to settle this

848
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,060
is for a consultative vote

849
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,360
on the correct pronunciation of Wussfuss.

850
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,480
Graham, if you're listening,

851
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,340
if you want to do some good versus bad polls on this podcast,

852
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,660
do write in.

853
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,500
Yeah, no, but if you want to do,

854
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,360
if I didn't want to volunteer, John,

855
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,620
to splice all the MP3s of Wussfuss together

856
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:10,280
into a lovely celebration of our linguistic diversity,

857
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,220
but actually it does sound very good,

858
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:16,160
especially if you're listening from somewhere far flung,

859
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,480
like, you know, Finland or...

860
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:18,880
Newcastle.

861
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,500
Jersey.

862
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,360
Australia.

863
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,260
Seattle.

864
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,600
The moon.

865
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,880
We know it's Wissfuss in Seattle.

866
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,300
We don't really need one of those.

867
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,360
Can I just say,

868
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,100
I'm looking at pictures of smorgasbords

869
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,040
on a well-known internet image search

870
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,720
and I can confirm that they excite me very much.

871
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,580
Yeah, they do.

872
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,440
But they're...

873
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:38,980
Om nom.

874
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,880
Nom nom nom.

875
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,860
Nom nom.

876
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,540
Oh yeah,

877
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,060
are you feeling hungry, John?

878
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,620
Ha ha ha ha!

879
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,780
Right then, listeners,

880
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,160
that's the Liz signal

881
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,220
that we need to progress quicker to picks.

882
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,100
So there's one other thing,

883
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,100
which is Erin Underwood wrote an excellent opinion...

884
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,280
What does op-ed stand for?

885
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,920
Opinion editorial?

886
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,780
Is an editorial not always an opinion?

887
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,840
Anyway, Erin Underwood wrote an article on Fast 770

888
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,980
about selecting program participants for world cons.

889
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,140
It is very excellent.

890
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,140
One of the things she calls for is a bit more grace and understanding.

891
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,020
I think one of the reasons why we didn't get a lot of outraged comments

892
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:16,500
on our last episode is that we are largely in accord that,

893
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,140
you know,

894
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,160
it's not too helpful to be very, very shouty and angry

895
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,720
about some of this stuff.

896
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,720
And so yeah,

897
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,160
we recommend you go read that.

898
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,780
I would also point out,

899
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,000
we should link to Jason Samford,

900
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,200
who dropped an investigation into Seattle.

901
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,480
And it turns out that his reporting indicates

902
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,120
that all of this was triggered by a single person

903
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,240
who had used ChatGPT in the process.

904
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,860
And that's what caused everything that stemmed from there.

905
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,100
So it was just one volunteer who used this tool.

906
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,220
And I'll link to that in the show notes as well.

907
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,700
Worth having a read of both of those, I think.

908
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,120
But we won't go into detail.

909
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,940
I don't have a lot to say about them.

910
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,280
I just think they're interesting perspectives.

911
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,600
I don't know if either of you.

912
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,900
Ah, so if it was one volunteer using the tool once,

913
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,680
then one of the ways this spun is that

914
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,160
people were in a hole and started digging.

915
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,400
There's definitely a point there about volunteers

916
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,220
and the lack thereof.

917
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,580
I'm not sure that big internet flame wars

918
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:18,520
increase the uptake of volunteers for WorldCons.

919
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,760
And so if we want to have more volunteers

920
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,020
to avoid using these tools,

921
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,220
we might want to consider how we treat those volunteers.

922
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,860
when we think that they've done goofed.

923
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,800
And obviously most of the outrage landed on the chair

924
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,560
and the division head,

925
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,200
which is probably as it should be really.

926
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,260
But even so, it's still not ideal.

927
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,820
I have no idea who the volunteer was.

928
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,340
No, I don't think that is known.

929
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,480
No, and I think that's exactly correct, really.

930
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,380
There's no point dropping the internet

931
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,100
on the head of a person who did this.

932
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,680
In good faith, probably.

933
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,360
It never occurred to them, probably.

934
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,340
Someone who was pushed for time

935
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,440
and trying to speed things up

936
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,340
and didn't think it would be a big issue.

937
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,060
And yeah, you kind of have to protect your volunteers

938
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,960
by saying, okay, the people higher up

939
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,660
who could have potentially stopped this

940
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,060
by being a bit more explicit in their instructions

941
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,400
or whatever.

942
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,400
I think it's fair enough

943
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,800
that they end up being the kind of public face of it.

944
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,800
Yeah, agreed.

945
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,600
And in Seattle's defence,

946
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,520
that's exactly what they did.

947
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,760
All right, let's do pics

948
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,100
so that Liz can go and eat some food.

949
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:25,580
Yes.

950
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,280
Yeah.

951
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,420
Can we have one day...

952
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,680
Today!

953
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,700
Today, I want Hulk Liz at a smorgasbord

954
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,480
because she's hungry.

955
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,300
Can we do that for art?

956
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,120
Does that work?

957
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,760
Please?

958
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,580
That would be great.

959
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,360
So, yeah, Hulk Liz at a smorgasbord.

960
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,080
Yeah.

961
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,560
That's a nice, simple prompt, right?

962
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,960
You and I can be sandwiches

963
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,020
and Liz can be eating us.

964
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,320
Um, no.

965
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,440
Too weird.

966
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,480
Too weird.

967
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,700
All right.

968
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,160
The rest of the idea was good.

969
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,840
I might just do a smorgasbord.

970
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,260
It's not often you get to see Alison speechless.

971
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,200
So I'm quite happy with this.

972
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,120
Right.

973
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,380
Shall we do pics?

974
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,000
Sorry.

975
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,860
I'm not sure how a smorgasbord

976
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,980
differs from a shark coochie board.

977
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,540
More pickled herrings.

978
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,160
Oh, yeah.

979
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,780
Maybe.

980
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,680
Convey that in art.

981
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,200
Oh, I'm so...

982
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,520
I am really looking forward

983
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,920
to going to the Order of Darlars in Stockholm now.

984
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,520
Yup.

985
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,060
Good.

986
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:21,900
Pics!

987
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,760
Who's picking first?

988
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,800
I haven't picked yet,

989
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,680
so I'm not picking first.

990
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,280
Right.

991
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,140
So I am being the least original

992
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,720
and most unsurprising pick

993
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,920
in the history of picks

994
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,000
in that I am picking Andor,

995
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,700
either the second series of Andor

996
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,560
or the entire thing

997
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,420
because I have now watched it all

998
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,100
and can confirm it's very good.

999
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,000
I mean, it's good enough

1000
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,040
that even if you have always hated Star Wars,

1001
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,260
and think the whole thing is drivel,

1002
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,820
it is probably worth watching

1003
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,260
Andor, it is that good.

1004
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,080
It's such a good show.

1005
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,660
Yeah, it's great TV.

1006
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,620
It's not just great for Star Wars.

1007
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,120
It is magnificent.

1008
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,280
It is so good at,

1009
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,280
as a mass market product,

1010
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,240
writing a piece of television

1011
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,600
about what it is like

1012
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,680
to live in an oppressive empire,

1013
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,360
how that affects lots of different

1014
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,240
ordinary people

1015
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,100
going about their everyday lives,

1016
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,760
and in particular,

1017
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,640
how very ordinary people get radicalised.

1018
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:31,480
Andor is a prequel to the Star Wars movie,

1019
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,360
Rogue One,

1020
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,100
which itself is expanded

1021
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,040
from a single line

1022
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,140
in the opening crawl of Star Wars.

1023
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,840
So they took the single line

1024
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,620
that said the Rebel Alliance

1025
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,960
had won its first battle

1026
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,240
and acquired plans to the Death Star,

1027
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,760
and they made a movie,

1028
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,480
Rogue One,

1029
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,400
all about that,

1030
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,500
and then Andor

1031
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,020
is a two series,

1032
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,780
now finished,

1033
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,860
you can watch the whole thing,

1034
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,060
television series

1035
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,060
that explains

1036
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,420
how some of the characters

1037
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,260
in Rogue One

1038
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,680
got to where they are

1039
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,840
at the start of that movie,

1040
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,760
and there are other characters

1041
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,840
as well who do not appear.

1042
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,100
And the whole thing

1043
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,860
is just immense

1044
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,860
in lots of ways,

1045
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,660
and one of the ways

1046
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,180
it's immense

1047
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,880
is that the implication in there

1048
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,480
is that any other

1049
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,460
single line of Star Wars

1050
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,360
might be appropriate

1051
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,240
to be developed

1052
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,740
into an entire world,

1053
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,160
that there is a universe

1054
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,320
of stories out here,

1055
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,080
and including some quite good ones.

1056
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,940
You wouldn't necessarily know this

1057
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,440
from watching all of the output

1058
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,840
of the Star Wars universe

1059
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,380
at the moment,

1060
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,480
but it's not all being made

1061
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:32,860
for me,

1062
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,660
and or definitely is though.

1063
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,480
It's not the very end of it,

1064
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,040
it kind of drifts a little bit,

1065
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,460
it's still great,

1066
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,620
it never gets less

1067
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,500
than absolutely great,

1068
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,340
but there are some points

1069
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,860
in the last few episodes

1070
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:47,800
where they're clearly

1071
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,440
inserting hooks

1072
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,800
that are going to be part

1073
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,720
of the story in Rogue One,

1074
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,580
and so that makes it

1075
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,260
as a standalone product

1076
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,640
just a tiny bit less good.

1077
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,540
We had,

1078
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,880
I'd seen Rogue One once

1079
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,260
when it was fairly new,

1080
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:01,940
I don't think I saw it

1081
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,340
in the cinema,

1082
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,260
but I think I saw it

1083
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,300
on television shortly after.

1084
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,360
And I hadn't watched it again,

1085
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,980
I deliberately didn't watch it again

1086
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,100
until Andal was finished,

1087
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,420
but now I have watched it

1088
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,220
again,

1089
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,640
and can confirm

1090
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,500
that it does the job

1091
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,500
of knitting it all together

1092
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,040
very well,

1093
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,500
and also it stands up

1094
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:16,840
very well,

1095
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,300
and now of course

1096
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,520
I want to watch Star Wars,

1097
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,460
the one true,

1098
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,320
the one true Star Wars movie.

1099
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,440
So yeah,

1100
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:22,940
it's great,

1101
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:23,520
go watch it,

1102
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,520
fabulous stuff,

1103
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,880
and buoyed up by that,

1104
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,560
I've started,

1105
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,840
we've started season four

1106
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,660
of The Expanse,

1107
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,100
so,

1108
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,580
you know.

1109
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,360
Everyone take a drink.

1110
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,400
Only three more seasons to go.

1111
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,100
And the seasons do get shorter,

1112
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,740
so you know,

1113
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,720
you're within,

1114
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,160
inside the finishing line.

1115
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,840
Oh,

1116
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,540
are they?

1117
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:40,160
Yeah,

1118
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:40,720
the last series

1119
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,520
is only six episodes.

1120
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,220
I got to the end of season three

1121
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:43,660
and I thought,

1122
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:43,800
well,

1123
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,980
they've kind of wrapped it up here

1124
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,500
as if there may not be any more,

1125
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:46,900
so,

1126
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,220
so season four,

1127
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,100
they have to kind of

1128
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,200
start a whole new story off,

1129
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,080
which is quite interesting.

1130
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,620
Yeah,

1131
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,180
so in the,

1132
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,280
in the books,

1133
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,220
the books are nine books

1134
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,200
and basically each three books

1135
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,260
kind of tell a loosely,

1136
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,800
like a little arc.

1137
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,120
I think they're,

1138
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,400
hey,

1139
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,360
books four to six

1140
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,560
and by extension,

1141
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,360
seasons,

1142
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,360
the latter seasons of the TV show

1143
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,880
tell a very interesting,

1144
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,340
very,

1145
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,140
very good

1146
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,100
kind of

1147
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,660
solar system politics story,

1148
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,000
which I really enjoyed.

1149
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,120
So yeah,

1150
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,220
and then,

1151
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:17,680
you know,

1152
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,660
book seven got weird.

1153
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,240
Andor's good listeners,

1154
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,840
I recommend it too.

1155
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:22,680
Who knew?

1156
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,400
I'm behind with it

1157
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,500
and I don't think it's quite as good

1158
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,300
as Severance,

1159
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,860
but that is sort of,

1160
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,480
you know,

1161
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,180
it's,

1162
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:30,540
it's,

1163
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,020
it's a,

1164
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,540
it's a hell of a comparator,

1165
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:32,860
right?

1166
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,640
Like,

1167
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,300
it's not quite as good as what I would argue

1168
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,120
is one of the best science fiction series

1169
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,600
is of the 21st century.

1170
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,260
Aren't we blessed to have

1171
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,380
amazing shows like this on television

1172
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,920
doing science fiction?

1173
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,980
We really are.

1174
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,440
That we no longer have to say,

1175
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,560
has there been any good science fiction TV?

1176
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,200
Well,

1177
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,580
Holland and Edison wrote an episode

1178
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,640
of Star Trek once.

1179
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,300
Yep.

1180
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:52,980
Liz,

1181
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:53,480
do you want to go

1182
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,380
or do you want me to go now?

1183
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,560
I'm trying to decide

1184
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,540
if I want to start an argument

1185
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,240
with Alison

1186
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,040
about televisual SF

1187
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,620
and fantasy of the 2000s,

1188
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,680
but I think I will save that

1189
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,660
for another episode.

1190
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,480
Oh yeah,

1191
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:04,640
no,

1192
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,380
we could put it in as a sort of plot foot.

1193
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,000
Yeah,

1194
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,620
I need to,

1195
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,000
you know,

1196
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,920
have a bit more brain

1197
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,140
and not be quite so...

1198
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,120
I wasn't really thinking

1199
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,060
of the 2000s,

1200
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:13,500
you see here,

1201
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,200
I was kind of thinking

1202
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,780
of the 1980s.

1203
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,180
Possibly the 1980s,

1204
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,640
that was true,

1205
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,080
but I think we should not overlook

1206
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,740
the contribution of stuff

1207
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,240
from the past 25,

1208
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:22,680
30 years

1209
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,680
because there's some good stuff there.

1210
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,760
Although Alison will probably

1211
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,860
get to it in about 2040,

1212
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,580
so...

1213
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,080
On the subject of

1214
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,540
J. Michael Strudinsky

1215
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,200
and Babylon 5

1216
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,180
and good TV

1217
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,040
from the 90s,

1218
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,480
he's moved to the UK.

1219
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,360
I saw,

1220
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:35,820
yeah.

1221
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,520
Yeah.

1222
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,800
It's quite a big step

1223
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,760
just to run Doctor Who.

1224
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,920
I'm going to pick a book,

1225
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,360
listeners.

1226
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,420
Hey!

1227
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,580
I know, right?

1228
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,960
I am going to pick

1229
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,960
Welcome to Forever

1230
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,520
by Nathan Tavarez.

1231
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,320
So this is a novel

1232
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,760
from last year.

1233
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,000
It is a novel

1234
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,020
about a man called Fox

1235
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:02,660
and Fox is having

1236
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,420
a very recuperative time

1237
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,540
and then someone makes him

1238
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,680
a tiny little clone

1239
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,160
of his dead ex-husband

1240
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,580
and he very much

1241
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,200
enjoys that.

1242
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,560
Ex-husband because

1243
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,680
of the death

1244
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,860
but also ex-husband

1245
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,500
because of

1246
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,880
various other things.

1247
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,360
It's interesting.

1248
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,920
I think it's really good.

1249
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,080
I really enjoyed it.

1250
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,620
It's kind of cyberpunk-y.

1251
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,020
It's about

1252
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,380
a great many things

1253
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,580
and it uses the

1254
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:30,400
metaphor

1255
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,060
that it employs

1256
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:32,960
very deftly

1257
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,580
to talk about

1258
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,280
many of them.

1259
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,680
There is a particularly

1260
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,600
brilliant scene

1261
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,860
where some of the characters

1262
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,100
are walking through

1263
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,120
a city

1264
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,840
and then there is

1265
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,400
a glitch

1266
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,120
in their neural interfaces

1267
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,260
that means the

1268
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,600
beautiful lovely city

1269
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,480
that they are surrounded

1270
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,040
by kind of fades out

1271
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:48,620
and is replaced

1272
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,680
by the actuality

1273
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,620
of what surrounds them

1274
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,420
which is much much

1275
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,700
less savoury.

1276
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,660
And it kind of

1277
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,580
comes back to that

1278
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,200
central metaphor

1279
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,020
and uses it to talk

1280
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:56,860
about kind of things

1281
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,500
like anxiety

1282
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,360
and masking

1283
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,080
but also talk about

1284
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:00,740
queerness

1285
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,520
and about what it is

1286
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,040
to be queer

1287
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:03,580
and what it is

1288
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,160
to be out.

1289
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,560
It talks about

1290
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,420
protests.

1291
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,340
It talks about

1292
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,380
the role of capitalism

1293
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,180
and technology

1294
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,360
in our lives

1295
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,060
and it talks about

1296
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,820
duties of care

1297
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,520
and it's just very good.

1298
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,020
I really enjoyed it.

1299
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,120
It spoke to me

1300
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,400
on many levels

1301
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,720
and its ruminations

1302
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,540
on unfettered capitalism

1303
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,280
and on the cult

1304
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:26,840
of personality

1305
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,940
that tends to lead

1306
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:28,600
those companies

1307
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,780
and on mental health issues

1308
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,260
all really resonated

1309
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:33,940
with me.

1310
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,020
I would very much

1311
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,120
recommend people read it.

1312
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,180
Yeah, it's really stuck

1313
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:38,520
with me

1314
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,080
and I really, really enjoyed it.

1315
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,400
Right.

1316
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,460
I haven't read that yet.

1317
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:41,760
So.

1318
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,420
Sounds really good.

1319
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,140
Does sound good.

1320
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,660
I liked it.

1321
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,040
I'm going to pick a pick

1322
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,780
which I honestly

1323
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:48,300
don't need to pick

1324
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,080
because I'm pretty sure

1325
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,140
everyone on this podcast

1326
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,160
or listening to this podcast

1327
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:51,800
has either read it

1328
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,700
or is going to read it

1329
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,940
but I'm going to pick

1330
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,560
The Incandescent

1331
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,560
by Emily Tesh anyway.

1332
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,580
You all know

1333
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:58,300
Emily Tesh won a Hugo

1334
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,900
for Some Desperate Glory

1335
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,460
and The Incandescent

1336
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,100
is the follow-up.

1337
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,560
It is totally different

1338
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,100
in that it is

1339
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,260
I mean I would call it

1340
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:06,940
dark academia

1341
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,000
although the Goodreads page

1342
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,540
is full of people

1343
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,040
arguing about

1344
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:09,800
whether this is really

1345
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,500
dark academia

1346
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,680
so yeah

1347
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,160
but basically

1348
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,920
it's about magic school.

1349
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,560
If the magic school

1350
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,420
was basically

1351
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,680
a private sixth form

1352
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,340
in the UK

1353
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,300
and could only teach magic

1354
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:20,840
because magic

1355
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,060
is basically like Latin

1356
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,060
it's this super niche subject

1357
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,040
that only a few

1358
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,140
rich schools can teach

1359
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,040
and it might get you

1360
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:28,860
into a good university

1361
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,240
to study magic

1362
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,140
which you're probably

1363
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,120
not going to actually do magic

1364
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:32,700
but you might go on

1365
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,700
to another career

1366
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,180
and it is

1367
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,580
one reason I like it

1368
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,720
is it's very explicitly

1369
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,600
it's a very English

1370
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,220
school story

1371
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,360
but updated

1372
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,360
to the present day

1373
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,560
so there is a lot

1374
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,820
of teaching observations

1375
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,940
and lesson plans

1376
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,780
and you know

1377
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,300
working out sources of risk

1378
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,240
and pastoral care

1379
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:49,840
of your students

1380
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,100
and not enough time

1381
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,280
for everything in the day

1382
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,420
and I really like that

1383
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,480
I mean I'm not a teacher

1384
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,240
but I know enough

1385
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,260
to recognise

1386
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,340
what seems to be

1387
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,200
a pretty good portrayal

1388
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,200
of teaching

1389
01:01:59,200 --> 01:01:59,920
in the modern system

1390
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,820
I also

1391
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,060
I do like the kind of

1392
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,760
the world building

1393
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,200
and the magic system

1394
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,480
the Lear character

1395
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,000
is Dr. Safi Walden

1396
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,500
and that is explained

1397
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,020
and it is a joke

1398
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:09,620
Hey!

1399
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,180
Yeah I spent a bit of time

1400
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:11,420
going

1401
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,800
is that really a joke?

1402
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,320
Yeah okay

1403
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,720
So I really enjoyed it

1404
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,640
I found it a pretty

1405
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,400
fast read

1406
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,520
I found it interesting

1407
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,740
I mostly like

1408
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,460
the central romance

1409
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,840
although there's kind of a

1410
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,560
you know

1411
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,120
a red herring

1412
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,760
that goes on

1413
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,700
which is a bit

1414
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,920
too obviously

1415
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,460
a red herring

1416
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:27,820
and in fact

1417
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,200
that would be

1418
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
my main criticism

1419
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,300
is sometimes

1420
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,140
bits of the plot

1421
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,980
were really obvious

1422
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,640
and I'm not sure

1423
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,260
if they were supposed

1424
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,100
to be really obvious

1425
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:34,680
and it's because

1426
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,880
the narrator cannot see

1427
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,720
like her

1428
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,640
her blind spots

1429
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,200
and flaws

1430
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,240
in not spotting them

1431
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,600
or if they're actually

1432
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,020
supposed to be

1433
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:42,720
a surprise to me

1434
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,480
which they were not

1435
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,960
but even kind of

1436
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,440
figuring out

1437
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,260
what was going to happen

1438
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,300
I still enjoyed it

1439
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,600
what I really liked

1440
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:49,960
about it

1441
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,460
is that

1442
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,560
Safi is a

1443
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,700
middle-aged woman

1444
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,100
and I think you really

1445
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:54,680
get the sense of

1446
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,260
sort of reflecting

1447
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:55,920
on her life

1448
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,460
and reflecting

1449
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,700
on her past relationships

1450
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,080
you know

1451
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:58,600
at one point

1452
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,320
like she meets

1453
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,040
her ex-girlfriend

1454
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,280
and you can really

1455
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,100
kind of see us

1456
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:02,620
seeing like

1457
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,840
the path not taken

1458
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,880
and deciding like

1459
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,040
where she gets

1460
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:06,920
satisfaction from

1461
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,900
the path she has

1462
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,300
taken

1463
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,200
I mean I think

1464
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:09,540
you're all going

1465
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,100
to read it anyway

1466
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,620
but it is good

1467
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,860
it's not quite as good

1468
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:13,500
as Some Desperate Glory

1469
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,460
but it's still very solid

1470
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,600
I would not be surprised

1471
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,320
to see it on lots

1472
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,260
of award shortlists

1473
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:17,700
next year

1474
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,080
is that one of the books

1475
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,560
is that a 2025 novel

1476
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,480
probably yes

1477
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,320
yeah it's just come out

1478
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,400
I think that sounds

1479
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:23,840
very good

1480
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,960
my opinion

1481
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,240
people probably know

1482
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,180
but obviously

1483
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,540
not quite as good

1484
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,560
as Some Desperate Glory

1485
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,520
is still incredibly

1486
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,520
high praise right

1487
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,920
that was such a good book

1488
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,620
even a book

1489
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,380
that is only 90%

1490
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,200
or 80%

1491
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,320
or even 70% as good

1492
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,060
it's still going to be

1493
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,700
entirely my jam

1494
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,000
so I'm looking forward

1495
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,580
to reading it

1496
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,200
I'm also looking forward

1497
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:43,760
to her appearing

1498
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,720
at Novacom

1499
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,440
I mean it's

1500
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,500
partly expectations right

1501
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,240
Some Desperate Glory

1502
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:47,880
I kind of went in

1503
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,400
with people saying

1504
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:48,980
oh this is good

1505
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:49,760
but not really

1506
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,020
many pre-made expectations

1507
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,140
whereas I went into

1508
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,060
The Incandescent going

1509
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,400
oh this is going to be good

1510
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,200
it's the new Aminitesh

1511
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,320
and so it's got a very

1512
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,260
high bar to live up to

1513
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,380
so when I say

1514
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,220
not quite as good

1515
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,260
I might be marking

1516
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,160
it a little harshly

1517
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,100
but it doesn't have

1518
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:03,980
some of the kind of

1519
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,100
jaw-dropping moments

1520
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,020
I think it's deliberately

1521
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,040
a little bit more internal

1522
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,140
like a little bit less

1523
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,040
like the giant

1524
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,280
space opera ideas

1525
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,480
it's just a different book

1526
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,960
I'll probably get it in

1527
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,900
hardback

1528
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,660
and take it to Novacom

1529
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,160
to get it signed

1530
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:17,660
alright

1531
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:18,520
in that case

1532
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,020
that was the Octothorpe podcast

1533
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,180
and it's goodbye from me

1534
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,280
it's goodbye from me

1535
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,660
and it's goodbye from me

1536
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:46,380
so I have a new hobby

1537
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,140
which really doesn't have

1538
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,080
anything to do with the podcast

1539
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,240
but I'm so excited about it

1540
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,180
I want to talk about it

1541
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,080
is it playing games

1542
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,280
no it's buying games

1543
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:53,940
and charity shops

1544
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:54,840
buying games

1545
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,620
and charity shops

1546
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:59,280
because it turns out

1547
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,040
that I need to go

1548
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,640
for a walk every day

1549
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,340
for my health

1550
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,020
but I hate

1551
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,320
you know stupid little

1552
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,000
walk for my stupid

1553
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,360
mental and physical health

1554
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,840
and I hate going for walks

1555
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,640
I absolutely hate it

1556
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,280
but it turns out

1557
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,040
that if you say to me

1558
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,260
would you like to go

1559
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:12,860
for a walk

1560
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:13,680
that takes in two

1561
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,660
or three charity shops

1562
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,640
and you can buy games

1563
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,000
I'm like

1564
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,440
oh yeah no

1565
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,100
I'm up for that

1566
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,700
I come home with sacks full

1567
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,040
and some of them are terrible

1568
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,220
but some of them are great

1569
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:21,920
so you know

1570
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,280
it's good

1571
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,360
and I was going to mention

1572
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,020
in terms of stupid party games

1573
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,480
we played Nacho Stack

1574
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,140
which I paid three pounds for

1575
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,120
in the British Heart Foundation

1576
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,860
and it involves you stacking nachos

1577
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,040
and then removing nachos

1578
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:34,800
it is a

1579
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,340
it is an extremely close simulation

1580
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,580
much closer than many video games manage

1581
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:40,800
video games

1582
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,860
it's a much closer simulation

1583
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,460
than many board games manage

1584
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,240
and I've picked up

1585
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,460
all sorts of interesting things

1586
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,980
and some absolute junk

1587
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:50,680
oh god

1588
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,140
but I'm getting better

1589
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:52,980
I would

1590
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,560
that's a dangerous hobby

1591
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,360
oh it's fab

1592
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,280
there's so many

1593
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,160
there's so many games

1594
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,880
in charity shops

1595
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,680
you have no idea

1596
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,740
and it's good for the planet

1597
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,020
right

1598
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:01,860
because it stops

1599
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:02,880
all of these games being

1600
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,040
I don't know if it does

1601
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,600
stop all these games

1602
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,300
going into landfill

1603
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,020
a lot of them end up

1604
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:07,720
in landfill anyway

1605
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,460
because I get them home

1606
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,500
inventory them

1607
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,720
and there's loads of bits missing

1608
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,140
and I go

1609
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,480
oh no that is junk

1610
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,560
every game will

1611
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,380
on an infinite

1612
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,120
time scale

1613
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,240
end up in the ground

1614
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,600
you should burn them

1615
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,380
if I put them in

1616
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:18,980
I mean

1617
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,080
yeah they'll get burnt

1618
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,700
bits that can't be

1619
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,500
recycled

1620
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,760
will get burnt in London

1621
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,400
ah

1622
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,220
because we have

1623
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,240
we have incinerators

1624
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,640
but this is one of the things

1625
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,260
with um

1626
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,860
this is one of the things

1627
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,040
with um

1628
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:31,700
a card game called

1629
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,460
Earthborn Rangers

1630
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,520
is it is entirely

1631
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,300
compostable

1632
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,160
quite a lot

1633
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:35,960
more and more are

1634
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,060
I get more and more games

1635
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:37,860
that have no

1636
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,060
no non

1637
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:39,980
cardboard parts

1638
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:40,480
yes

1639
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,440
and then I get

1640
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,580
I get games

1641
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,400
from the 70s

1642
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:43,860
that are like

1643
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,420
giant plastic

1644
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:46,580
monstrosities

1645
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:47,520
yep

1646
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,520
they have plastic

1647
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,500
boards and plastic

1648
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,440
pieces and plastic

1649
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,760
balls and it's amazing

1650
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,160
sorry that was way off

1651
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,160
topic but I just

1652
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,120
it will wear off

1653
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:55,800
in a bit guys

1654
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,920
shall we do the rest

1655
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,860
of the show notes

1656
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,380
oh also I am playing

1657
01:06:59,380 --> 01:06:59,960
blueprints

1658
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:00,940
a lot

1659
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,000
excellent

1660
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,700
for those who don't

1661
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:05,140
know

1662
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,040
um

1663
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:06,760
this was actually

1664
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,400
the reason Liz

1665
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,300
thought to pick it

1666
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,360
was because the

1667
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,880
art for the subsequent

1668
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:11,360
episode

1669
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,800
we already knew

1670
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,540
in advance listeners

1671
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,120
was going to be a

1672
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:14,660
blueprint of an

1673
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:15,200
almond croissant

1674
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:15,760
so that was

1675
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,780
that was uh

1676
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,760
Liz's inspiration

1677
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,360
for picking it

1678
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:18,740
I think

1679
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:19,760
is that right Liz

1680
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,140
yeah that reminded me

1681
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:21,900
that I could pick it

1682
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,940
and ruin

1683
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:23,680
Alison's life

1684
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,560
when I was like

1685
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,840
shall I not pick it

1686
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,480
because it might ruin

1687
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,240
Alison's life

1688
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:27,940
oh no I'll pick it

1689
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:28,200
anyway

1690
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,140
it is good though

1691
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,200
well it didn't

1692
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,260
so so what happened

1693
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,500
was that we recorded

1694
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,380
that episode

1695
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,940
about two minutes

1696
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:35,860
before I got in the

1697
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:36,580
car and went off

1698
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:36,980
for a holiday

1699
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:37,740
on the North Norfolk

1700
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:38,160
coast

1701
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,280
where I did not

1702
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,000
you know I

1703
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,160
I hardly got onto

1704
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:41,880
the internet at all

1705
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,340
I certainly didn't

1706
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,280
play any video games

1707
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,880
and then I got home

1708
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,900
and John sent us

1709
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:46,880
the podcast to listen

1710
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,560
to and I got to

1711
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,800
Liz's pick and I

1712
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,340
went oh I have not

1713
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,160
yet bought that game

1714
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,060
I should see if it

1715
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,000
will run on my Mac

1716
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,980
and it does

1717
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,340
and so I have played

1718
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:56,860
it quite a lot

1719
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,720
but at the moment

1720
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,360
I'm mostly playing

1721
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,140
games with my family

1722
01:07:59,140 --> 01:07:59,620
because it's my

1723
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,340
holiday weekend

1724
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:00,660
so

1725
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:04,060
I'm going to say

1726
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,000
that I have been

1727
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,660
playing this is

1728
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,340
massively massively

1729
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:06,960
off topic now

1730
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,720
I've been playing

1731
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,460
the Zelda game

1732
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,300
haven't finished it

1733
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,200
yet it's all right

1734
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,980
oh Echoes of Wisdom

1735
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:12,640
yes

1736
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,720
yeah I picked it

1737
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,360
and I think Liz has

1738
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,080
played it as well

1739
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,300
no not yet

1740
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:16,780
although I do

1741
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,360
on a Switch so

1742
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,720
I have I've played

1743
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,980
up to about 90%

1744
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:20,660
of it and then

1745
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,380
stopped and this is

1746
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:21,960
something I do with

1747
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,520
a lot of games

1748
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,260
so I'm kind of like

1749
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,320
is this me

1750
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,060
because you have

1751
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:25,380
ADHD

1752
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,640
no I don't think

1753
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,340
it is I think

1754
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:28,720
I kind of don't

1755
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,660
want it's like I

1756
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,040
did it with Horizon

1757
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:31,840
Zero Drawn and

1758
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,760
with Dredge I kind

1759
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,460
of get to a certain

1760
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:34,340
point and go oh if

1761
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,040
I carry on much

1762
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:35,540
further there won't

1763
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:36,280
be any game left

1764
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,100
so I'll just play

1765
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:37,680
something else for a

1766
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,140
bit and then come

1767
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:39,180
back to it except

1768
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:39,960
that I don't

1769
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,600
it's fair

1770
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,440
that could say

1771
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:41,780
ADHD

1772
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:43,340
