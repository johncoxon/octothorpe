1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 I am very sleepy, sorry guys. I'll probably wake up while we pod and I've got loads of coffee.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,600
 Aye.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,000
 But there's no more coffee coming once it, because you know, abandoned.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,200
 Witness my intensity for people not being brought coffee,

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,520
 during pods. This is fair.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,080
 I don't know how little man who like, comes all the way to the house with your coffee and quests on.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,080
 I mean, I can get a man on a motorbike to bring me coffee from a shop, but I have to go now and collect it.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,320
 Hey, I'm the subject of being coffee, bringing coffee during pods.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,600
 Thank you. This is of the opinion our diamond slippers are pinching.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,160
 It's just fair.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,440
 Yeah, if I find there's probably my coffee machine before the pod or something, I don't get coffee.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,640
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 122nd episode of Octothorpe.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
 This episode is coming to you on the 7th of November 2024.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,840
 I'm John Coxson.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,560
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,200
 And as we record, it is the weekend before Halloween.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,600
 Does anyone have any Halloween plans?

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,040
 I am going to carve a pumpkin and it is going to have the face of beetle juice on it.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,960
 That's as far as I've got really.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,240
 But I'd like to do a fairly topical pumpkin and that seems like the topical pumpkin for the moment.

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,200
 We've got a pumpkin.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,920
 I don't think we've made a decision on what to carve into it yet.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,080
 But I will put a link in the show notes even though it'll be a bit late because it'll be carved by the time you listen to this.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,440
 Yes, and then Liz.

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,000
 How big's Halloween in Toyland, Liz?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,600
 Kind of surprisingly big, but mostly as a marketing thing.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
 Like, I don't think most kids will go out like trick or treating or something,

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,400
 but there are like Halloween parties and I went for a pedicure this morning

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
 and they'd put up loads of plastic spiders.

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,960
 I am going to sit in my house and give lots of sweeties to small children

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,440
 and pretend that I'm scared by their costumes.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
 Yay!

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,720
 So, Ispania and I had a party last night, which was folk horror themed

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,080
 and I will endeavour to put some photos in the show notes, listeners.

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,640
 But Ispania made like a big round shroud with like a face in the middle

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,400
 and put bunting all over the house and made flowery wreaths and decorated all of the banisters with flowers.

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,040
 And it all looked very summer-aisle and I costumed as Christopher Lee's character from the Wicomann.

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,560
 And then she's like, "Kids won't get this, so I'm going to need to completely redecorate the house before the night itself."

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,960
 And I'm like, "Or, or we could just give them sweets because that's what they really want."

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
 So I don't know. I don't know how that will pan out.

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,520
 They don't care what your house looks like as long as there's a pumpkin outside it.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,160
 Yeah, one or so. I think it's creepy enough. It's fairly creepy.

43
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,040
 But yeah, it was good. And we had a lot of candles, like a lot.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,560
 For the small children, I think it will be creepier if they don't really understand what's going on,

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,840
 but knowing your house looks like you're in mid-tomour or the Wicomann.

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,200
 I think it'll be creepier if you have like a small wicomann in your house

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
 and you measure them up with a tape measure as they come to the door.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,480
 [

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,960
 For the listener, this pause was intentional.

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,040
 When we were still in Southampton,

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,520
 ispan your dressed as like a woman in a white dress and like put blood all over her hands.

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,600
 And they were kids who were like genuinely like very freaked out by it.

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,760
 So I do think the other thing is, I think you've got to go a little bit easy on the little ones.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,920
 We've got some letters of comment listeners.

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,400
 We have a letter of comment from Christopher Degas here.

56
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
 And the first thing to say is happy 50th birthday Chris.

57
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,080
 Brilliant. He says on Alison's pick, as Alison was first described with the UFO 50,

58
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,520
 and mentioned the Alex, he was searching his game historian brain to figure out what she was

59
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,200
 talking about, only for her to reveal it as an alternate history thing.

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,520
 Tiny fists of rage. So yes.

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,200
 That is the effect I was going for. I am very glad it's worked for at least one person.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,400
 He says that the next one he listens to will likely be listened to on the road to a

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,240
 lucha libra wrestling show with the kids as part of my ongoing birthday celebration.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,400
 Octa thought the gift that keeps on giving.

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,440
 Now I am a bit worried that that's the episode on grass,

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,400
 which we did not record with Chris's kids in mind.

67
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,560
 Oh, no, that's a lot of discussion of feminism and horses.

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
 So sorry Chris.

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,000
 We did actually, to be fair, you did put lots of trigger warnings on the thing.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,760
 People should check out trigger warnings before plague a podcast to children,

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,720
 because it might talk about interspecies sex.

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,160
 Spoiler.

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,000
 Yes. He also says that he met someone, he was in a Starbucks,

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 and there was a woman reading alien clay.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Good. I have alien clay on my shelf.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
 Megas lent me her copy, so I'm going to read it.

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,000
 We also heard from Jake SellebrÃ¼cken's editor of the Ancillary Review of Books,

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,800
 next in publication. He points out that actually some Hugo Sanquis were made by the Ancillary Review

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,600
 of Books in 2021 for the discussion of the Hugo results,

80
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,320
 so they may be the first Hugo Sanquis.

81
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,800
 And they are very nice.

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,440
 Thank you.

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
 So we will link to those in the show notes.

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,600
 And we also heard from Zoya Connell,

85
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
 maker of the Sanquis diagrams, referred to in the last podcast,

86
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,440
 suggesting that yes, it would be great if all the data came as CSV rather than PDF,

87
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,160
 because that's basically what takes most time in making the graphs.

88
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
 Always, the data cleaning takes more time than making the graphs.

89
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,120
 Transatlantic Bestie Laurie from Hugo Girl said,

90
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,200
 "This morning I heard the term 'Sanqui diagram' for the first time in my life,

91
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,920
 and then the second time, the third time, and so on until about the 25th time."

92
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,240
 Yes.

93
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,640
 I mean, we're good. We help people with graphs.

94
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,040
 On that note, I listened to a recent episode of Hugo Girl,

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,120
 and I can confirm that the X axis is the one that's horizontal,

96
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,600
 and the Y axis is the one that's vertical.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,320
 Graph chat.

98
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,640
 Are they a data challenge podcast?

99
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:21,520
 I think we are significantly to the right of the mean on how much we know about graphs.

100
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,040
 I am the least data forward of the three of us, and I cannot believe.

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,720
 I mean, I think if you kind of picked three humans from all humans,

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,720
 and I was the least data forward of them, that would be very surprising.

103
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,440
 Yes.

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,040
 Because I am in the top 0.01% of the population in terms of my data enthusiasm, so, you know.

105
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,560
 I think that's right.

106
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,160
 What you've got to remember is that X is a cross, and so the X axis goes across.

107
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,280
 Science fact.

108
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,800
 I think X axis goes across, and the Y axis goes up, but which way does the Z axis go?

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,400
 Into the plane of the board.

110
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,080
 It goes nowhere because if you've got a Z axis making a 3D bar plot,

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
 and they are nominations, so.

112
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
 Well, I mean, Liz, I do physics.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,480
 We do actually have to consider all three dimensions quite commonly.

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,600
 Four shadowing.

115
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,200
 But do you plot them all on the same figure?

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,880
 We usually, yes, we do.

117
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,000
 I mean, this could be a very long digression.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
 And maybe it's better because I find isometric plots are the domination,

119
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,440
 because what you're basically doing is condensing your three dimensions into two dimensions,

120
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
 but being super fuzzy about which two dimensions you've picked,

121
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
 which I find very infuriating.

122
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,320
 I strongly recommend Hades and also Bastion.

123
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:46,640
 I recommend Grand Theft Auto 2, which was the correct view.

124
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,040
 I was in the XY plane.

125
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,800
 And which is on Netflix, and which is on a free on Netflix, I think.

126
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
 I recommend watching the Twitch streamer who's playing Grand Theft Auto 4 all the way through

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,880
 with the speed of all the other cars set to maximum.

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,440
 Anyway, we might have digressed.

129
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,080
 It's just possible.

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,400
 Roman Ozansky wrote in about PDFs.

131
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,920
 He basically went through a bunch of different examples in his email of e-pubs and HTML and

132
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,560
 whatnot, and what they display us on various different screens.

133
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,880
 Later in the episode, we're going to talk about,

134
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,480
 "I'm going to try by Donald O'Dekpeki."

135
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,840
 And a reporter heard from a friend was that they hadn't read the report yet,

136
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,640
 because it was a PDF and they were on their phone.

137
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
 And they were like, "I don't know what it says,

138
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
 because it's too small to read.

139
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,720
 So I'm going to have to wait until later when I'm on my computer."

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,280
 And I was like, "Yes, this is back to that same discussion point."

141
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,680
 Thank you very much for writing in Roman.

142
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
 I suppose only old people get to say,

143
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,440
 "Trying to read long documents on your phone and then giving up is what's

144
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,200
 addling your mind and get off your phones and spend more time on big computers,

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,960
 ideally ones that are fixed to the wall."

146
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,400
 I just don't think that's helpful, is it?

147
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,320
 Is your computer fixed to the wall?

148
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
 Probably not, though.

149
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
 I mean, I think I'll just be over here shouting at clouds.

150
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,440
 Well, and also, is that what's addling people's minds?

151
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
 Ah, yes, no, I don't know.

152
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,080
 Yeah, no, it is.

153
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,760
 It's 100% it's that people are interacting with content

154
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,720
 through a tiny, tiny screen, which is not well-optimized for it.

155
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
 So they therefore veer to less thoughtful content,

156
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,920
 even more than they would anyway,

157
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,840
 because the less thoughtful comment is often monetized to make it more attractive to you.

158
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,960
 It's complicated.

159
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,160
 I mean, I think we've got to accept that there are millions and millions of people

160
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,400
 who do not own computers and will never own computers but own phones.

161
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,440
 That's completely fair, but actually that's not mostly the people

162
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,720
 who we're talking about here.

163
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,280
 But yeah.

164
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,160
 But also, I think we have to bear in mind that people who are very good at psychological

165
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,960
 manipulation are very good at it at all screen sizes.

166
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,280
 And my mother primarily consumes all of her gamification on Facebook through an iPad,

167
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,720
 which is a big screen and yet still has all of those traits.

168
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
 So I would put it to you.

169
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,120
 The problem is capitalism not screen size.

170
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,840
 And I'm fully up for dismantling capitalism, but this may be a digression.

171
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,360
 So I segue into an email received from Emily January, I think literally...

172
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,920
 Was it about capitalism Liz?

173
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,360
 No, it's about PDFs again.

174
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,040
 Emily, if you want to write in with thoughts about dismantling capitalism, feel free.

175
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,520
 But Emily does basically discuss some of the things we talked about about publications

176
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,080
 last time.

177
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,000
 And that like what she appreciated from the newsletter team at Glasgow is that the updates

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,520
 went on a blog as well as a PDF.

179
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,920
 So it would be something which would dynamically resize, whereas all the PIs and so on were

180
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,840
 formatted for printing.

181
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,040
 And so they look beautiful, but do not resize.

182
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,200
 And they say this isn't a Glasgow Worldcon specific program.

183
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
 A lot of UK fandom is very attached to PDFs.

184
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,360
 Yes.

185
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,040
 I mean, I do see the point, especially for progress reports where I look at Belfast's

186
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,680
 beautiful progress reports and I go, this is a work of art.

187
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,320
 These are absolutely lovely, but probably people want a bunch of information they can

188
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,000
 read on their phone, where make sure you have all of that information in a phone-readable

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,400
 way, e.g. on your website, as well as in your beautiful PDF.

190
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,120
 Well, in general, I just find people who construct...

191
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
 Because the other thing that you find very commonly is someone's like,

192
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,920
 "Oh, I've done this.

193
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,040
 I've made it a Google Doc."

194
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,200
 And I'm like, "I do not want it to be a Google Doc.

195
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,400
 I want it to be a web page."

196
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,640
 And that also, like, because again, that doesn't render well on my phone.

197
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,640
 And I don't want to spend my entire life at my computer.

198
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,840
 Sorry.

199
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,880
 Are you just arguing that you don't want to spend your life on your computer,

200
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,240
 so you want to use your phone to do things that are better done on a computer, John?

201
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,520
 No.

202
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,600
 I think I fundamentally disagree with you that these things are better done on a computer.

203
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,160
 I think this is once again an example of where we cannot assume everyone feels the same way

204
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,040
 as we do.

205
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,880
 And also, I spend a lot of time in their computer.

206
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,000
 I spend a lot of time on, you know, trains and public transport and things,

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,560
 where I'm not going to get my laptop out and read a PDF.

208
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,520
 That's the thing, right?

209
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,080
 Like, I'm not saying I want to spend my entire time glued to my phone,

210
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,080
 but I am saying is that if someone's released some news and I've got five minutes in the queue

211
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,200
 for a sandwich, I might read the news on my phone while queuing for a sandwich.

212
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,920
 And if you've put it in a format where I can't do that,

213
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
 I might instead go on Instagram.

214
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,920
 It's not that you're competing with me going home and being on my computer to read it.

215
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,720
 You're competing with the other things which are on my phone.

216
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,720
 Which are much more compelling than trying to scroll in on a tiny PDF.

217
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,920
 And I read Instagram more on my phone than fanzines on my phone.

218
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,040
 Is that good?

219
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,840
 Maybe not.

220
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,560
 If fanzines were better to read on my phone, would I read more fanzines?

221
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,040
 Maybe.

222
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,920
 Would that be better?

223
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,400
 Maybe.

224
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,720
 Should fanzine fans like pay attention to that?

225
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,360
 Maybe, but it's not up to me to say because whenever I do, people get very happy about it.

226
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,320
 So are the web-based fanzines that you love so much?

227
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,680
 Good to read on your phone, John, and do you read them?

228
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,240
 Yeah, because I read most of my RSS feeds on my phone.

229
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,400
 Not exclusively because it syncs to my computer, but largely.

230
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,680
 My phone might have a bigger screen because, yeah, I do find I do more things on my phone than

231
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,560
 I used to because more things are phone first.

232
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,840
 There's a great tweet about buying flights on our phone and this is not a phone job.

233
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,280
 This is a laptop job or something.

234
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,640
 I'm going to have to find it because it's quite funny.

235
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,600
 Shall we move onwards?

236
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,400
 Maybe.

237
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,760
 So we've had a Facebook group for OctaThought for a couple of years now and

238
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,960
 anyone who's in the group, oh, you're very welcome if you're on Facebook,

239
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,320
 then do join the group.

240
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,520
 Anyone who's in the group is welcome to post, but nobody except us ever does,

241
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,840
 except that Ali posted a post to the group to say, "Tell us two things."

242
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,280
 The first one was, as your intermittent SF for younger readers correspondent,

243
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,480
 I have recently become a huge fan of Patrick Kenny.

244
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,200
 I've just finished Monsters of Rookhaven,

245
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,360
 which is a beautifully illustrated story about the true nature of monstrosity, family and friendship.

246
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,280
 And his latest book is Stitch and she thinks he's up there with Francis Harding and Patrick Ness.

247
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,240
 So, yeah, go read that chaps and she also recommends the podcast.

248
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,920
 I'm a fan of that having by Ollie and I don't know who else.

249
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,400
 We met Ollie at Wollcon.

250
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,560
 So I have not actually checked out that podcast yet, but it is Ali's recommendation,

251
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,680
 so go and do that.

252
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,160
 There we go.

253
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
 And more people should post to our group if you have interesting things to tell us.

254
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,160
 This is good.

255
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,800
 Thank you.

256
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,240
 Having just looked it up, I believe that I'm a fan of that.

257
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,440
 It's hosted by Vivian Asimoz and Ollie Rose,

258
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,000
 and we will put a link to their Instagram and the show notes,

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,680
 which has their link tree so you can find out where you can listen to it.

260
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,640
 So we also heard from Kat Kobetty, who says, "Let's recommend more of an announcement."

261
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,320
 We just launched a new podcast project titled "S8.25,"

262
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,200
 which is celebrating 25 years of Strange Horizons.

263
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,640
 And we like Strange Horizons.

264
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
 They are good eggs.

265
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,600
 And I also like this podcast because, I mean, it's a good podcast,

266
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,200
 but also the sound is beautiful.

267
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,240
 It sounds like BBC radio hosts speaking into my headphones.

268
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,840
 So we do recommend that you go and check that out.

269
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,680
 And also 25 years of Strange Horizons.

270
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,280
 That is a lot of Strange Horizons.

271
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,760
 It is.

272
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
 Makes me feel old.

273
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,320
 Caroline wrote to us and said, "You may have a discussion in this episode 120

274
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,520
 that rather assumed future Wilcons would be hybrid,

275
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,120
 and that con runners would be learning better how to embed the online convention into the event."

276
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,760
 Smofcon has announced that it is de-hybridting for this year.

277
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,280
 And we're going to talk about that in a bit.

278
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,120
 And she, Caroline says, "This feels like a bad sign for future hybrid Wilcons."

279
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,480
 I'll be interested in your take.

280
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,600
 I do think it's a bad sign.

281
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,840
 We're going to talk about Smofcon specifically,

282
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:48,480
 but I think the argument is slightly different from a tiny convention like Smofcon than it is

283
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,360
 for a huge convention like Worldcon, which has the word "world" in its name.

284
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,200
 And therefore, I think has something of a responsibility to try and draw in voices from around the world,

285
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,840
 which is also something we will talk about a bit later in the pod.

286
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,840
 As for Smofcon, I think it's fascinating that Smofcon has decided that pulling in its

287
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,680
 reach and concentrating exclusively on the fans who can afford to fly to Smofcon

288
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
 is an interesting take.

289
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,600
 And I would contrast with Corflu, which has been hybrid for longer than any other con,

290
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
 and is probably going to continue to be hybrid forever,

291
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,560
 because it's a small global community that does not have very much money,

292
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,640
 and is therefore contrasting with Smofs.

293
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,000
 So when you sign it for Corflu, do you sign it for like a hybrid membership or an in-person membership,

294
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,280
 or is it just kind of membership?

295
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,720
 Three memberships which are attending, which gets you the attending and the banquet and all the

296
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,560
 publications, supporting which gets you the virtual and the publications, which are still huge

297
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,120
 chunks of trees being shipped around the planet, sorry guys, and virtual, which is just attending

298
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,280
 the online con. And I think they're trying to persuade them to put the PDFs in that, but I don't

299
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,040
 know if I'll get that far. If you're Corflu, reach out and tell us what you're doing.

300
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,480
 Yeah, I mean, it sounds very much like they offered a hybrid virtual membership,

301
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,480
 and very few people bought them. And I guess there is a point where you have to say, okay,

302
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,000
 we have very few people who are going to be benefiting from this, is it worth putting our time

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,400
 and effort in? It is a bit of a problem because you might sign up for virtual very late.

304
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,680
 Like, there's no real reason to sign up for virtual, it's not really incentive to sign up for

305
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,760
 virtual like a year in advance, unless you really, really know you won't be able to make it,

306
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,400
 and you want to support the con. If you're still thinking you might be able to make it,

307
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,520
 then you'll just kind of hang on and then buy a virtual membership at the last minute.

308
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,080
 So maybe there needs to be like a kind of a cut-off date for virtual or a please sign up early,

309
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,600
 even if you're virtual, then we know they're coming. It'd be interesting to know if like

310
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,440
 after Smofcon said this, have they received messages from a bunch of people saying,

311
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,200
 "Oh, actually, we're going to join virtual," or is it that there really really was low demand?

312
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,920
 It'd be interesting to see if they discussed that at any point.

313
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,240
 Yeah, I can also say if you're a small con and you have very limited people power,

314
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,080
 then that is one thing you can drop if you think it's not really going to be used.

315
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,880
 I am going to say two things. Firstly, there's a difference, isn't there, between?

316
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,720
 I find hybrid conferences in my day job completely useless because the whole point of going to a

317
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,280
 conference in my day job is to have chats with people after their talks about what it is they're

318
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,000
 doing and that's very difficult to do in hybrid. And that says to me that the more that your

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,360
 proportion of the event is about the networking you get in the bar afterwards, the less it is

320
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,080
 useful to have it hybrid. And so in that case, I think a lot of what Smofcon offers as a convention

321
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,280
 is probably building links between smoughs in the bar afterwards. And I think that's very hard to

322
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:47,120
 do hybrid. And so I suspect there is an angle here where Worldcon, I mean, I know that this is not the

323
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
 way we think of it necessarily as a trio, but I think there are some people who see Worldcon

324
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,920
 basically as a thousand program items that they will go and enjoy and then go home once the program

325
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,240
 is finished and then come back the next day and repeat. And that's the thing you can do. If you're

326
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,480
 all you're doing is watching panels, you can watch panels from your sofa and you can have an almost

327
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,440
 identical experience. That says to me that I'm not sure whether Smofcon doing this is a bad sign

328
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,120
 for Worldcons generally because I think that mixture of the reasons people want to attend is

329
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,280
 very different for the two. But equally, I do see the point that Smofcon should probably be modeling

330
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,960
 best behavior for con running. And this doesn't seem like that. I agree with a lot of that,

331
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,200
 particularly the first one, because Smofcon is more than any other convention I've been to,

332
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,560
 all about the networking and contrasting with Corflu again, Corflu is all about meeting your

333
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:47,760
 old friends, including friendships made over many decades in some cases. So it's a very different

334
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,040
 vibe, even though the bar is still the most important thing. But there's also a thing

335
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,600
 like I suppose Smofcon thinks if we're going to do virtual, we have to demonstrate best practice,

336
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,120
 whereas Corflu's always done virtual by just sticking a webcam in the corner of the program

337
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,920
 to whatever effect that generates, which is about cheaper offering. And that's why they've been

338
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,440
 doing it for 20 years before anybody else was because there was a thing called Ustream, I think it was,

339
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,360
 and they could just have a Ustream. I think that's the it's it's going for a different thing. It's

340
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,560
 trying to attract a different thing. And I think you're completely correct about about Smofcon being

341
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,640
 all about the networking afterwards. I went to almost none of the program when I went to Smofcon,

342
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,960
 I still had a fabulous time and met a lot of people and learned a lot about com running,

343
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,560
 much of which could not have taken place on the formal program. And then in terms of your second

344
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,600
 point Glasgow had, I think, 600 virtual members, which is really quite a lot. So there's, if you,

345
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,280
 if you build it, they will come for the Worldcon, I think there will probably won't be quite so many

346
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,840
 for US Worldcons. There's a time zone thing where it's much easier for North American fans to attend

347
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,960
 European conventions virtually than it is for European fans to attend North American conventions

348
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:07,440
 virtually. Yeah. And this goes into a discussion of privilege in con running and a sense of,

349
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,520
 I think there's a sense of there can be, I think, a sense of us versus them between con runners and

350
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,480
 people who come to cotton. I think that's kind of exacerbated by the fact that if you want to be on

351
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,920
 the inside of that loop to do it properly, you have to go to Smofcon, which is a hell of a time and

352
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,440
 money investment. And that is tricky. And they're a bursaries. And I don't know how you, and we're

353
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640
 having the same problem in academic conferences, because people are like, well, if you make them

354
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,360
 hybrid, you solve the problem. And it's like, you don't really, because again, the primary thing

355
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,480
 about academic conferences is the networking. And by saying we can make it hybrid and have people

356
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,200
 come from less well off countries or the global south or wherever, you're basically saying,

357
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,640
 well, they can just watch the talks, but they don't get any of the networking. And we don't have to

358
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,800
 try and make the networking more accessible, because we've done this thing for them and it's fixed.

359
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,840
 And it's like, but it isn't fixed. And this really complicated. So there's like a really

360
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,960
 complicated discussion of privilege and of wealth here. And I don't know how you square any of

361
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,320
 these circles. And it's something I've been thinking about for like four years, and I haven't reached

362
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,280
 any answers. So I'm not sure I'm going to solve it soon. Some of the solution is designing good

363
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,680
 virtual social spaces, which is something that I have been bleeding on about for four and a half

364
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,840
 years and feel like it's never nobody cares. It's only me. I'm the only person who cares.

365
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,840
 Yeah. But I'm going to ask, I'm going to, I'm going to ask a provocative question,

366
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,880
 which is how much time at Glasgow did you spend in the virtual social spaces versus how much time

367
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,480
 did you spend in the physical ones? Yeah, so none of it. So that's the thing. You could design the

368
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,920
 best system in the entire world and people in the room still aren't going to want to use it.

369
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,120
 And I don't know how you fix that. You have a dedicated online smothcon as well, because that

370
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,520
 way you could bring in the voices, but nobody cares enough to make that happen. I mean,

371
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,640
 I think you made me slightly talking across purposes, because I think John is also partly

372
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,160
 talking about academic conferences. I'm using it as an example, but I think it's very similar.

373
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,840
 I think it's similar, but I think there is a bit of a difference when there's kind of people's

374
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,720
 professional goals are in there as well. Also, there are definitely some academic online conferences,

375
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,960
 quite a few. And it's exactly the thing that you'd expect it to be, which is where it's a

376
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,320
 relatively poor bit of academia that has a small global community and online convention. They

377
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,640
 have embraced online conferences. They exist. It gets me examples, because I think the vast

378
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,440
 majority of conferences have gone back to being in person. Oh, very skeptical, both sides just though.

379
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,480
 We're speaking specifically from the scientific perspective.

380
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,040
 Specifically, I have been doing a number of conferences where they make the talks available

381
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,480
 online, and there are discussions and stuff, and yeah, you're not getting the networking,

382
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,800
 but it's way better than not having them online, because it's not a choice between online or

383
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,280
 in person. It's a choice between online and not going. I guess what I want to be careful of is

384
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,680
 I want to be careful of viewing, putting the talks online as fixing the problem, but I do want

385
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,560
 them to put the talks online. Yeah, that's fair enough. Like, I'm giving a talk there. I was invited

386
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:19,120
 to Rome with three weeks notice. I was invited to a plasma observatory meeting in Rome to talk,

387
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,040
 and unfortunately, I'm annual leave. So I'm going to deliver the talk remotely, which will be much

388
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:30,560
 worse than going to Rome, but I equally can't go to Rome. So yeah, I mean, it's much worse, but

389
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,880
 my students have been to a number of conferences and watch the talks that they would not otherwise

390
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,520
 be able to go to, and that's like immeasurably beneficial for them, even if it's not quite as good

391
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,360
 as getting to actually go there in person. Trying to look at some of Connor's at Bellweather for

392
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,600
 Wilcons doesn't really work, because Smofcon is like 100 people and almost always in the US,

393
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,920
 and in US time zones and Wilcons are quite often in the US, but not 100 people.

394
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,760
 So I actually think it has not progressed as much as you think, Liz, because I think I've changed

395
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,760
 my mind, which is I do think that Smofcon should be doing what it can to put sessions online,

396
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,360
 even if people will miss out on the networking, because it's still better to be inclusive as

397
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,600
 inclusive as you can, even if it doesn't fix everything, you can make it better. And air

398
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,160
 perfect is the enemy of good. And particularly free play. Yes. Well, yeah, and that's the other

399
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,560
 thing. So replay for the people, because one of the things I am doing when I'm in person

400
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,520
 conventions is not going to the program, but I bet I've seen more of the Glasgow program than the

401
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,880
 average person who went to Glasgow at this point. Oh, I mean, I think that probably depends which

402
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,040
 average you're using, but that definitely gets into the weeds. So shall we move on?

403
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:48,480
 This episode is brought to you by people who think a lot about very, very niche things.

404
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,040
 We can go back to Sankey diagram if you want, John. No, this is I love it.

405
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,480
 The previous 121 episodes were also brought to you by people who think a lot about very niche things.

406
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:10,240
 World FantasyCon was held last week in Niagara Falls, New York. It looked very nice,

407
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,840
 mostly because I've seen pictures of Niagara Falls a lot, unlike Facebook and Blue Sky.

408
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,440
 I haven't seen any pictures. I don't think of the actual conference, but I'm sure it was very nice.

409
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,520
 Anyway, I just want to say that they announced the World Fantasy Awards there,

410
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,200
 and I just wanted to pull out that the winner of Best Novel was The Reformetry by Tana Rivedo,

411
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:36,160
 which I had as a pick quite a while back, and I was very glad to see that it won an award.

412
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,800
 I quite like it when like major awards are sort of kind of apportioned out between different books.

413
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,080
 Yeah, sometimes it's something that comes along and means everything, but actually I think it's

414
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,200
 quite interesting that we have something that Windsor World Fantasy Awards that wasn't, say,

415
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,960
 even on the Hugo shortlist, and also in this case I like it because it's a good book.

416
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,440
 So yeah. Does it have dragons in it, Liz? There are zero dragons, I recall.

417
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,280
 Okay, cool. Just checking. Do you only read books with dragons in now, John?

418
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,720
 No, but it's one an award for Fantasy, and in my head, Fantasy is either Wizards or Dragons.

419
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,360
 Ah. This might be quite a limited view of the genre. Yeah, I mean, given that the winner of

420
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,600
 the valor is called Half the House is Haunted, one of short victims called Silkencott and Linen

421
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,760
 and Blood, and the anthology that wins is The Book of Witches. I think that maybe a certain degree of

422
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,720
 horror crossover here. Interesting, interesting. Are you saying that none of those books have dragons

423
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,520
 in either? I haven't read them, so I can't rule out the fact that there might be dragons in some of

424
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:36,400
 those. Okay, no, so the Reformetry, I think, was the first pick you made this year because it was,

425
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,720
 it is still on my, I've bought it, and I haven't listened to it yet. Listen to it, I'm ready yet.

426
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,080
 Oh, was that when you were going to go through all of my picks for the year, and that lasted like

427
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,480
 a whole zero episode? No, I'm still going to do it. I just haven't done it yet. Oh, I see. It's got loads

428
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,000
 of time. It's October. Yeah, yeah. But this Four Shadows are Complaint, which will come later in the

429
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,040
 episode. And Liz, I think has now twigged what the complaint might be. No, I do want to say,

430
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,440
 I agree with you. I think it's good when good books get awards, and I think it's good when that love is

431
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,880
 spread. I think it's better for the community generally. And the World Fantasy Awards are one of

432
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,360
 those awards where there's sort of some public voting and a jury, and I come and I'm how they fit

433
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,400
 together. But it does have some jury aspects, which say the he goes do not at all. So it's always

434
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,200
 interesting to get that kind of perspective of people who maybe read specifically and very widely

435
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,000
 for one particular award, much like, you know, judge science fiction awards, which there may be one

436
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,600
 in the UK. And then do we want to talk about other awards? Yeah, I was just going to mention

437
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,480
 the Kitchis, which an award that we possibly don't mention very often on here. But there's a nice

438
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,160
 piece in the bookseller because they have revealed their final shortlist in that they have decided to

439
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,440
 close down the awards after 15 years, which I found quite interesting. Basically, they have

440
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,120
 decided that it's becoming a lot of work. And so instead of keep going, they are going to, you know,

441
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,000
 go out on their own terms after 15 years with a final shortlist. And I thought that was a very

442
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,880
 interesting way of doing it rather than kind of keep going on until there's no interest or until

443
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,120
 you are forced to cancel them one year to say, okay, this is the last year. Let's make a success

444
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,480
 of it and we'll be done. I think they do also usually have interesting shortlists, although I

445
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,400
 confess I've read two books, I think, on this year's shortlist. So yeah, what's on the shortlist?

446
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,280
 Well, they've got my which Your Wishes My Command by Dean of Mohammed, right? So that was on the

447
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:36,080
 a graphic story. Yeah, that's also the interesting about the Kitchis is that, you know, they just

448
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:43,280
 have like a graphic novel in the debut novel category alongside non graphic novels. And yeah,

449
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,320
 why not? I've read, I've read Your Wishes My Command and I've read In Ascension. I thought In

450
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,800
 Ascension was pretty good. That's the one I've read. Yeah, I thought it was, you've read all of

451
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:03,200
 the clock shortlist from last year, right? Um, maybe? Did I say I had? I can't remember.

452
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,720
 Basically, I've read In Ascension and I think it's not the best one. So, you know, but it was all

453
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,800
 right. It just, I don't know, I don't know, judges, eh? I'm deeply aware that this is coming for me.

454
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:24,160
 So yeah, let's return to this in a year and see. Oh, I will have no comment. No, I've read three

455
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,600
 of six on last year's clock shortlist and I would, I would have founded a tough choice. So I can

456
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,560
 see how you also might get into, oh, we have to come up with a consensus winner. I mean, I probably

457
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,200
 would have given it to some Dashbook Glory, but still, I also really like Jane Gang All-Stars.

458
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,560
 I haven't read that one. So the Ursula K. Le Guin Prize has been announced and it's gone to

459
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,920
 It Last Forever and Then It's Over by Anne de Marcan. This is interesting because that book

460
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,280
 beat out both some Desperate Glory and The Saint and Prey Glor doors to win the award and that kind

461
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,720
 of echoes what we were saying earlier about it being good when the love is spread around the field

462
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,040
 and certainly I will have to pick this book up and read it because I haven't read it. It sounds

463
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:11,760
 interesting. Yeah, it also must be a weird eligibility period, I think. Well, I think those

464
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:20,720
 be on the wall by Mackayre Johnson is a 2024 book. Let me just look up the Ursula Gwynn Awards

465
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,240
 prize overview. We could say also there's a strange rise in view of all the books on the shortlist,

466
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,720
 which is interesting. Okay, so yes, it is a slightly weird, this year was slightly weird in the books

467
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,080
 published January through March of 2024, what eligible for the 2024 prize, then for 2025,

468
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,200
 it will be books published April 2024 through December 2024 to get them onto a calendar year.

469
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,360
 So that makes it interesting because it's a set of books that would otherwise not all be competing

470
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,880
 against each other. Yeah, because I think like the Siege of Burning Grass is also a 2024 book.

471
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:58,240
 So that's something which is potentially Hugo, eligible, etc. And it's quite good. So yeah.

472
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,480
 Having realised that, that's interesting because this might give a little bit of a preview of what

473
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,520
 will come up in the next few months for the nebulas and the Hugos, as you say. Also,

474
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,760
 Numi-Kare Johnson, always exciting. Yes, I haven't got to that yet, on my list.

475
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,840
 This is a Pro Mackayre Johnson podcast. I have a very guilty seat. I was reading lots of books

476
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,360
 and then I haven't picked up a science fiction book since Glasgow. I'm still reading the same

477
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,160
 one I was reading then. Something has happened in my life. I don't know what. Which book were you

478
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:32,720
 reading? It is the second part of architects, Adrian Tchaikovsky. And it wasn't the trouble

479
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,800
 of liking it. I was loving it. That's why I haven't just, because normally I just go, "Oh no,

480
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,000
 I'll start to own another book and then come back." That's great. Well, that was what I was going

481
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,920
 to recommend. And then you said it was Adrian Tchaikovsky and I was like, "You must read it."

482
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,920
 So that tells you where my head's at. Really enjoying it. And also, I want to read it because

483
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,560
 for I've forgotten the whole of the stuff that I have read, because I'm old now and I

484
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,480
 honestly need charts for novels where it shows me who everyone is and how they interrelate with

485
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,760
 everybody else and not in a dramatic persona at the beginning of the book. And a big chart into the

486
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,000
 wall. Look, all you need to remember is there's some weird, clam-style alien gangsters who all have

487
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,480
 names like The Unspeakable, Aclu, The Raised and The Hook, and then there's some crabs and it's great.

488
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,320
 There's some weird things in space. There's definitely weird things in space. There's many

489
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,560
 weird things in space. That's really the whole point of the book. And when there's a bunch of

490
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,800
 lovable rogues who are forming a motley crew of heroes in a family that doesn't like each other

491
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,280
 very much. Yes, I mean, I'm not sure they're all lovable. That's why it's great. No, I mean,

492
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,600
 this, this, have I mentioned before that this series of novels reminds me a lot of Blake 7.

493
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,520
 Anyway, we are probably off the topic. Yes, because we're procrastinating because we don't

494
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,480
 want to do the next bit. Am I going to have to get serious for a minute? Yeah.

495
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:56,080
 Bearing in mind that we are recording quite early for this episode, and so it's currently the 27th

496
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,240
 of October, and this news really only came out yesterday, and we wanted to discuss a little bit

497
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,000
 some of the discussion that's happening around a report about the author and editor,

498
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,280
 I'm going to show if we Donald Ekpeki. There is a report from a writer, Aaron Kens,

499
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:21,600
 that essentially they became friends on the internet and had lots of discussions. And it ended

500
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:28,240
 up basically with what seems to be Ekpeki saying that they would co-author a story,

501
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,840
 which is I think Kens is originally, and then Ekpeki made some edits to it, and that they would

502
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:40,320
 jointly submit it to magazines, and then it ends up basically that he submitted it just under his

503
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,920
 own name and is very unclear about what is going on and does not reply to our questions and seems

504
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,960
 to say, well, this is just what happens in publishing. But I think it's actually less interesting to

505
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,640
 me, this one particular incident, as much as what happened when Kens posted this report on Blue Sky,

506
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,720
 which is within a day, there were many, many other people replying to the tweet and

507
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,680
 quoting this tweet saying essentially that they had also had poor experiences with Ekpeki and

508
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,880
 that the whole thing made them very uncomfortable. And it just seemed like one of these things

509
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,840
 where someone being willing to talk about one incident made the floodgates break, and then everyone

510
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,720
 started discussing other incidents that had happened. And so what I found most interesting,

511
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,080
 I think, was probably a thread from Gotten Batya, which is safe for those who don't know Ekpeki

512
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,680
 that he is a writer from Nigeria, who's been nominated for multiple awards and edited multiple

513
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,200
 anthologies, and Batya is a writer from India, and that Batya's thread basically says, you know,

514
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,720
 he doesn't want to talk about one individual, but talk about kind of the industry climate that

515
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,840
 enabled it, and I think that is very interesting, and maybe there are reflections and lessons for

516
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:56,160
 us as basically a bunch of white British people. One of Batya's points is that when we value

517
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,840
 diversity andclusiveness, is our kind of white guilt getting in the way, and is that being leveraged,

518
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:08,400
 especially by people who can take advantage of the situation? And the things he particularly

519
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,600
 picks out are that Ekpeki had a lot of fundraisers repeatedly for coming to Wilcon and to other

520
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,160
 conventions, especially when he'd been nominated for awards, and is some of your white guilt

521
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,320
 basically saying, okay, we should give to this person's fundraiser, which really benefits only

522
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,880
 them, and is there a better way for us to kind of direct our efforts and funding into trying to

523
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,760
 break down some of these structural barriers that exist? I'm not sure I have personally a huge amount

524
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,240
 to add other than like there are obviously people discussing this that are worth listening to,

525
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,320
 but I do wonder if we should really be kind of rethinking what fundraisers we boost, what we promote,

526
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,520
 what we give to, and whether that is actually helping kind of the structural structural issues

527
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,000
 that need to be addressed, whether we're sort of making ourselves feel better by saying yes,

528
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,040
 this person can have a trip to a convention, and it's not to say you shouldn't give to people's

529
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,240
 fundraisers, but really think about kind of, are you doing this because you get some kind of warm

530
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,000
 fuzzy feelings for having helped someone travel to a convention they would not otherwise be able

531
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,360
 to attend? I want to give some props to Erin Kairns, who is the person who blew the whistle here,

532
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:18,640
 because she posted a tweet in June saying this is a thing that's going on, and it kind of sank

533
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,680
 without trace, and rather than just going oh well it just must be me then, she then went off and

534
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,040
 wrote a dossier which is what we've got now, and that has actually triggered the discussion,

535
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,880
 and I think actually getting into the bigger part of it, I stopped contributing to one

536
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,080
 global fund, because I observed that the same people were getting repeated trips, and I really,

537
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:48,720
 I'm a big fan of that not happening, when you see the same person getting trips to multiple

538
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,160
 conventions, you start going hmm, and and, and, pecky's not the first example of that,

539
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,840
 and not the first example of that where I've seen people getting multiple

540
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:04,160
 trips to conventions and gone well why, why this person, why not more people, and, and obviously

541
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,480
 there it's very complicated, because there are people who are extremely valuable members of

542
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,880
 community whose engagement is predicated on repeated fundraising and repeated bursaries, so

543
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:22,400
 it's incredibly complicated. Batty does mention in his thread that most of the people in the global

544
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,960
 south who are involved in writing and reading science fiction are part of the privileged part

545
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,600
 of their own communities as well, which I think is, is a fair point. I can't solve structural

546
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,360
 inequality in the world individually, I don't know what to do. Yeah, and the other thing is that

547
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,360
 there have been trolls for a while basically saying like oh you know he doesn't write his own staff,

548
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,960
 and it's always awkward when you, you end up like saying the same stuff as people who are

549
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,920
 saying it because they're massive racists, right? It's very frustrating because firstly I think

550
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,000
 what he's done is noticed that our community is very vulnerable to this kind of thing because we

551
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,400
 want to lift people up who are from marginalised background, which I think is something that is

552
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,960
 to our credit, but he has noticed that you can get quite a lot of personal benefit out of that

553
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,840
 and has exploited that. And secondly he, I think next time someone like this is coming up who is

554
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,760
 from the global south and who is a very talented editor and who is not doing this in a negative way,

555
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,080
 those racist trolls are going to be twice as loud and that is very annoying, just very heartbreaking.

556
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:40,480
 Yeah, no, but whenever you, whenever you find that you're on the side of the racist trolls,

557
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,720
 you have to remember that a stop clock is right twice a day. Still never, still never feels good

558
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,480
 though, yeah. You know, they're still wrong, right? It's not a good feeling. Yeah, and I think,

559
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,800
 I want to say additionally a lot of the stuff which has come out, so Aaron Kairns' story is about

560
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,080
 him submitting something to an anthology that was essentially their joint work under his own name,

561
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,000
 but a lot of the other things that people have mentioned are just, they're not things which are

562
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,800
 like completely unethical, they're just things which feel a bit like, oh this person is definitely

563
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,320
 trying to use my goodwill purely to further their own career. They're not things that you might call

564
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,440
 out as being specific or ethical things, but the things like pushing people to nominate you for awards

565
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,000
 or these things where you might not call them out as isolated incidents, but now they kind of go

566
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,560
 into a pattern of, okay, this person was definitely aware of how they could best get themselves

567
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,720
 award nominations, and then if you have award nominations, then that's the reason why you should

568
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,040
 be running a fundraiser to go to a convention, and then once you do that, maybe you'll become the

569
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,040
 guest runner at a convention, and you know, it's snowballing to boost your own career, and I'm sure

570
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,720
 there's tons of people who have done this in the science fiction world who have taken a

571
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,760
 advantage of connections, and you want to have connections with people, and it's just kind of

572
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,080
 pushing that a step too far, but then to submit something to a magazine under your own name,

573
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,960
 which is not your own work, is over the line, and that's where it came out.

574
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,200
 Yeah, yes, and there are other examples of just slightly off behavior, like I have a personal

575
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,680
 interaction with Ickpecky, which might be a good one, and there's lots of little things like that.

576
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,920
 Sorry, just be clear, are you saying you had one, or are the people saying they had one?

577
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,520
 No, I had one. Oh, okay, I had a very classic conversation with Ickpecky, a very classic sort

578
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,320
 of conversation that people have. If you are a Hugo finalist for a podcast, and you say,

579
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,800
 "Hi, great to meet you, really, and by your stuff, I'm Alison from Oxford, and they look at you as if

580
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:48,720
 they are a piece of chopped liver and they walk away." And that is not unique to one, this one person,

581
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,280
 but it is a conversation, it is the only conversation I have ever had with that person.

582
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,880
 I want to highlight something really quickly here, which this goes back, I think, there are

583
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,120
 parallels with this and the discussion we're having about some off-con, which the other thing is,

584
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,160
 our field is so much about who you know, and if you can get into a bubble or multiple bubbles,

585
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,680
 you have a significantly different time in fandom than you do if you don't.

586
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,200
 It's not wrong to do things that will attract attention to do things that get awards,

587
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,560
 that do things that network effectively with people who are influential in your area.

588
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:26,400
 I think this is something that we'd hope that a lot more creators from the Global South would

589
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,840
 be able to do now and in the future. I think what is wrong is not bringing your mates along with you

590
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:40,960
 when you do this. What I want to say is because that kind of networking relies on you don't go

591
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,440
 to a single convention and build that network, you go to many conventions over years and build

592
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,640
 that network. And so it's tricky, right? Because Egepeke got lots of funding to come to

593
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,200
 conventions repeatedly, but if we don't bring people to conventions repeatedly,

594
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,400
 we're also not bringing them into the network. And so I don't know how you square that circle,

595
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,760
 because I agree with you from what you said earlier, I agree that we want to make sure that

596
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,400
 this is lots of people and we're bringing lots of people over. But the other thing is if we bring

597
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
 lots of people over, we bring them once each, that's also not going to bring them into the

598
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,320
 community. I don't know how you answer these questions. I think they're hard questions.

599
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,440
 And they're all tied up in privilege. And I think it's very difficult to dismantle.

600
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,240
 You have fanzines, you have good online forums where people have good and ongoing discussions

601
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,280
 about conventions, about sorry, about science fiction. You have online conventions that can be

602
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,720
 attended for very small amounts of money globally. You have these networks. I'm part of a community

603
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:51,600
 in SF where the network has been created over many decades through these interpersonal engagements

604
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,160
 that do not cost a lot of money. And it's actually very easy to get it to that. You just have to

605
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,640
 read a few fanzines and write some letters. But that's not the, that's really not the network

606
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,160
 we're talking about here. We're talking about publishing. We're talking about, you know,

607
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,640
 selling your work and networking with editors. I will also say, even if you're talking about

608
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,320
 con running, that's not how you get into the con running. You go to smothcon, you go to worldcon,

609
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,920
 you go to the parties, because the con runners aren't reading and writing articles, or I mean,

610
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,080
 they are. But that's not the primary way you get into that bubble. That's kind of what I mean.

611
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,720
 Like, I think there are bubbles you can get into. But speaking of someone who can't afford to go

612
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,080
 to very many US conventions, and I know who goes to more US conventions than many people,

613
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,960
 I am on the outside of a lot of these bubbles because I do not have the networks that allow me

614
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,840
 to get into the middle of them. I am quite connected. So how the hell you do that if you're from the

615
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:45,200
 global south? I have no idea. But I don't think the answer is reading discussion forums, because I

616
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,760
 do that and I still feel like I'm on the outside. I run a Hugo award winning podcast,

617
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,840
 which explores these issues and I still feel like I'm on the outside. So like, I don't

618
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:01,360
 know how you bridge those gaps, but I don't think it's as simple as writing letters to fanzines. I

619
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:08,080
 think that's a very reductive answer that I think pretends that the issue is much less difficult than

620
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:14,800
 it is. No, sorry, it is fair. Certainly. But it's hard. It's hard. I do think it's not fanzines,

621
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,240
 though. I do think online communities are part of what can make this easier. Oh, yeah, 100%.

622
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,200
 It is you do not have to go to a lot of conventions if when you're not going to a convention,

623
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,760
 you're actually spending a lot of time in the space, in spaces where the people that you want

624
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,840
 to influence are that are not the convention spaces. Once every because people can all know who you

625
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,080
 are, despite the fact that they haven't met you, it is still possible to do that.

626
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,160
 I think we are unfortunately, sorry, I just want to say, I think the part of the problem here is

627
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,200
 that we are talking about a network people want to get in that we are not in, which is the network

628
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,280
 of publishing specifically and how you get your stuff in front of authors, how you get that

629
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,440
 invitation to like edit anthologies, how you find publishers to propose anthologies to. And I

630
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,680
 think maybe, I mean, I don't really quite understand how you become part of that because it's not

631
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,120
 something I've tried. So maybe, you know, we can only talk about our own networks, but not particularly

632
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,800
 that specific network that the aspiring writers trying to get into that in crowd.

633
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,480
 Well, that's why I'm talking about com running and not publishing because I do understand the

634
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,000
 com running network. I do understand where I sit in it and I do understand the barriers and I

635
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,080
 think they're very similar barriers. Yes. But I am trying to find analogies that allow me to say

636
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:36,720
 sort of anything useful. But because the other thing that like with getting into fandom at all

637
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,400
 in the UK, the other thing is not just wealth privilege. It's like time privilege. Because the

638
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,320
 other thing is like we always have our conventions in the UK at Easter and that makes things difficult

639
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,120
 for sort of people with various religious observances. And the thing I find difficult with

640
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,640
 smofcon is it's always in December, which is firstly always my birthday, but secondly always a

641
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,280
 giant international academic conference that I usually attend. So I even if I had the money to

642
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,960
 attend smofcon, I couldn't. And so like that's another consideration where I don't know those are

643
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,320
 extra barriers, which can be thrown up. But I do I take your point about for the publishing. I know

644
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:17,040
 nothing about those networks by also by I think I know enough about feeling on the outside of networks

645
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,880
 I would like to be in that I can say things about how that works. And I'm assuming full disclosure

646
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,320
 that that transfers and there might be nuances where it doesn't. That's a fair point. I think

647
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:34,560
 there are a bunch of of podcasts in our space that are talking about the exact thing of getting

648
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,520
 into the public getting into publishing. It might even be a preponderance of podcasts in the space

649
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,720
 that we are in that talk about that. So you know, if if that's an issue for you, go and listen to

650
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:52,000
 all of them. That's a good point. Can you name any specifically? Just because it feels like we're

651
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,960
 saying listen to some podcasts and that will help. Oh, well, I mean, if you look at if you look at

652
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,840
 podcasts that are traditionally nominated for the Hugo, then a bunch of them are about what it is

653
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,160
 like to be they are they are three writers who are trying to improve their networks by running a

654
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,320
 podcast. And they talk about this stuff a lot. They talk about their submissions, they talk about

655
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,080
 their writing, they talk about the sorts of things they are doing, the sorts of people they're meeting

656
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,680
 and the sorts of conventions they are going to. But I think they're I think you're right that

657
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,360
 there are a lot of podcasts by science fiction writers that talk about the craft. But I'm not

658
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,680
 sure how many of them focus on the because we're focused on science fiction fandom, right? So we

659
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,680
 talk about the kind of the community and we talk about how we interface with the community. We talk

660
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,080
 about how you get into that community and what that community is doing. I don't know if there's an

661
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:40,320
 octothorpe equivalent in the writing space where people are doing stuff like going deep in the latest

662
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:46,960
 sifwa news or talking about what sort of more professional geared conferences are coming up.

663
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,840
 I don't know if that actually exists. Readers write in. Have we got anything else on

664
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,920
 Ickpecky? Just to remind people we did say this at the beginning of the segment, but

665
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,400
 this is a rapidly moving story and it will probably be totally different by the time you listen to

666
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:11,840
 this podcast in 10 days time. We recorded this episode quite a while before it was released.

667
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:16,800
 And so we want to highlight that. Since we had this discussion, there's been a lot more conversation

668
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,080
 about this online and in particular, Ickpecky has responded to the allegations in a long PDF.

669
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:27,600
 We're going to post a link to that and to Jason Sanford's write-ups in the show notes so you can

670
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:40,880
 read those as well. Who wants to do their pick first? Liz, do yours first? Yes, so I believe this

671
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,240
 is going to be followed by John registering a formal complaint. But I have picked Japan.

672
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,520
 Because the reason this is that you got the episode on grass last week is that I was on holiday in Japan

673
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:57,680
 and it was great because I know Alison loves a good Peppers ghost effect. I was going to pull out

674
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,200
 that I went to Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland is great, but also it had what is

675
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,760
 absolutely the most jaw-dropping Peppers ghost I've ever seen. I literally sat there and my jaw

676
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,120
 dropped and kind of how on earth did they just do that effect way? It is a spoiler if you're

677
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,560
 planning to go to Tokyo Disneyland because it will tell you something that is jaw-dropping

678
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,160
 is a Peppers ghost and then you'll start going, "Oh, can I see if it's a Peppers ghost?" But it's not

679
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:25,520
 really spoiler in that the effect is of the beast imputing the beast transforming from the beast

680
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,880
 into the prince. So you all know that's going to happen anyway, but it does it just amazingly well.

681
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,400
 I've just watched the video. Firstly, I would like to say that it is appropriate that it is on a

682
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,960
 subreddit called Blackmagic Fuckery, the book which is editing that clearly has no other

683
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:46,800
 explanation but no good Blackmagic Fuckery. But secondly, what the fuck Liz? How how how like I

684
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:55,920
 don't what? That is my reaction. I really want a 3D video for that. I think it's probably a lot

685
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,240
 better in 3D than it is. That's because the thing that Peppers ghost does is 3D. It's pretty damn

686
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,920
 good in 2D, but sorry Liz, continue. It is amazing is the point. It's great and also also bear in

687
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,240
 mind that I think one of the neat things about it is that this is being viewed from many many

688
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,600
 angles because you're you're starting giant whirling teacups. And so there's quite a lot of people

689
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,880
 looking at this at once from different angles. So they had to make sure kind of that the effect

690
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,280
 was seamless for everyone on the ride. And yeah, just that is but it's just kind of one thing of

691
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,720
 Tokyo Disneyland was great and partly it's because they are really I think pushing what you can do

692
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,120
 with people in a in a theme park and what effects you can do in front of people. And they obviously

693
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:43,200
 put an awful lot of thought and care into it and it was just generally fun. And I think it's also

694
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,680
 quite a bit cheaper than the US ones if you have to get to Japan. Yeah, yes, which you know for me

695
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,640
 not too bad. But if you are thinking oh that's so far away I will never go. If you ever go to Japan

696
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,560
 I would recommend it as well as I would recommend just going to Japan. It was fun.

697
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:04,640
 Yes and this brings me to my formal complaint which is I was going to read, listen to, play or

698
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,680
 interact with all of your picks this year both view and when you pick things like Japan that gets

699
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,600
 quite a lot harder. Because I've been doing my best. Do you have anything else on Japan? Sorry Liz.

700
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,160
 I was just going to pick another I mean I'm going to find a video now of the other really

701
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,400
 cool effect which is so I went on the Tower of Terror ride. The Tower of Terror ride is not my

702
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,600
 favorite ride on account of it just like throws you up and down vertically and that is not my

703
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,160
 favorite effect. If you would like to know how much this is not my favorite effect you can ask

704
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,880
 Andrew and Anna who are my traveling companions on this trip and the photo of me on this ride was

705
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,760
 so bad and so funny that Andrew went to buy it. He never got to pick it up but he went to buy it

706
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,840
 because my expression was so bad. But I went on it basically because I knew the effects at the

707
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,600
 start would be so amazing and I've got to now I'll find and send you the effect of essentially

708
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,800
 there's a little kind of statue that wakes up and speaks and then disappears and it's probably a

709
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,320
 very simple effect but again it's just one of these things where it has to work for everyone in the

710
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:07,440
 room and just kind of wow you and also it still wows you even when you kind of expecting it.

711
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,440
 It's just very cool. Sorry John so maybe John you can just watch these YouTube videos of

712
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,600
 uh little cool special effects and consider that as good as a trip.

713
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,840
 Thanks Liz. Hybrid. Yeah.

714
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:28,480
 I have no further comments. Shall I move on to my London based immersive? Yes. We've been getting

715
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,800
 PR pictures for all sorts of things for a couple of years now and somebody said do you want to go

716
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:38,080
 through this thing and we ignored it because we had all our PR pictures and then the PR came back

717
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,120
 to us and said oh please come on you can do one if you could maybe do this and I was like well

718
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,880
 I'm in London and I quite like immersive so maybe I should go. It's bridge command. It is under the

719
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,160
 arches at Foxhall station in London and it is right by the station which if you've ever done

720
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,800
 immersives where you've had to walk for 20 minutes to some industrial estate somewhere it is not one

721
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:05,040
 of those. Being under the arches is quite good because you get a sort of rumble continuously

722
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,560
 through the thing which is very would be very expensive if they had to pay for it but but really

723
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,240
 makes you feel like you're in a spaceship. You and between four and 14 of your friends or

724
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,360
 random people you met or you meet at the event are the crew of a spaceship and you were given

725
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,600
 things to do and you're given different roles in the spaceship so I was the engineer and I had to

726
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:33,680
 deal with a fire in our nuclear reactor which was very exciting and also do a lot of things which

727
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,800
 are actually playing video games because you have little screens where your job is and it shows you

728
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:46,960
 how different systems are heating up while other people are firing the phases or whatever and

729
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:53,520
 it's kind of great and we really had a good time. It's very immersive they give you boiler suits to

730
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,760
 where I did not wear a boiler suit I wore a flight jacket instead because there is never

731
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:05,200
 been a boiler suit in the world made that would fit me and and you go on and we were a spaceship

732
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:13,760
 escorting a cargo ship to meet up with a group and obviously stuff happens that's how battles

733
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,120
 in space work but you know I would have thought that it was if you like immersives it's kind of

734
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:26,240
 pitch perfect for the sort of people who who read science fiction because they like big space

735
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,120
 battles so yeah there was a lot of fun really enjoyed it it is fairly expensive but I mean

736
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:35,680
 immersives are fairly expensive it's kind of it's not expensive compared to theater shows

737
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:41,200
 and obviously there are there are actors as well as you the actors were very good you're in

738
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,640
 there's a spaceport bar which I which I quite liked I like being in a spaceport bar I'm very

739
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,320
 easily amused. I think that's fair. But it is and it's obviously a labor of love it's clearly

740
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:59,920
 they did a kind of small version of it which apparently had um had had like cardboard sets

741
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,920
 and and a lot of the people who go to this a lot of people who were there when we were there

742
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,160
 have gone loads and loads of times because they love it so and all the stories different and

743
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,800
 the story is ongoing and stuff like that so it is not just a thing that you do once and then you've

744
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:19,200
 done it really enjoyed it and thank you for thank you for freebie. This it has echoes of when

745
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,720
 we went to Galaxy's Edge and you went to Phantom Peak whenever all of us go to Disney you go to a

746
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:31,200
 London based immersive this is a pleasing pattern. I will get to Disney in 2026 yeah and I will do

747
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,440
 Galaxy's Edge extensively. I think you find that if you messed upon the Millennium Falcon ride and

748
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,000
 if you messed up the Millennium Falcon got destroyed it might cause some continuity problems.

749
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,480
 All right I'm going to pick a book and it is a book that I read as a result of the clock award but

750
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,720
 it is not one of the clock award books from this year it is one of the short lists from last year

751
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:58,560
 which was Chain Gang All Stars by Nanakwame Adjibrenya which is very very good. I'm coming to realize

752
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:05,200
 that the thing I value most in science fiction at the moment is anger and it is an incredibly

753
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:16,800
 angry book it is very raw and it's about a future United States in which the penal system has gotten

754
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:24,000
 to the point where they've effectively recreated Roman gladiatorial combat as a form of justice

755
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,160
 and it follows a few characters over the course of the novel and sort of explores how they came to

756
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,960
 be incarcerated and how that works for them and the author has footnotes through the book which

757
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:44,640
 kind of explore the the various systemic prejudices against the type of people who end up in the

758
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:51,200
 justice system in the states and I found the mixture of and it's not a subtle book it's not

759
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:58,880
 trying to be a subtle book it's an angry howl that is taking everything to 12 in order to

760
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,160
 make it impossible for you to misinterpret what it wants to say to you and I valued that a great

761
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,200
 deal I thought that was very good and I don't think it would land for everyone but I loved it I

762
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:17,040
 just and it made me so angry and so sad and there's a couple of scenes which I was like Christ that

763
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:23,760
 is a scene and I really really enjoyed it so I'd highly recommend it to everyone um listening and

764
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,200
 I'm really glad I read it and I'm really glad it was on the shortlist go with that listeners

765
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,920
 that's my recommendation that's my pick I don't think either Liz or Alison have read it it's very

766
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,960
 much on my to be read list and that was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye

767
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,960
 from me and it's goodbye from me

768
00:58:43,840 --> 00:59:02,240
