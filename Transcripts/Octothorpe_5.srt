1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,100
Oh, and the other thing I've learned is I can't sit back in my chair because it does this.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:09,300
And it turns out that you can hear that on the recording, so if I lean back when I'm speaking,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,660
very difficult to edit out.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:25,640
Hello everyone, and welcome to episode 5 of the Octothorpe podcast,

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,600
a podcast about science fiction and SF fandom. I'm Jon Coxon.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,080
I'm Alison Scott.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,360
And I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,060
And we have a letter of comment this week from Claire Briarley of Croydon.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,400
And one of the things she asks is, why do we always go Jon, Alison, Liz?

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,120
Alison and Liz, do you want to reveal the secrets behind the curtain?

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,560
It's because if we don't go Jon, Alison, Liz, then...

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,200
Then Alison and I talk at exactly the same time.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,920
And every time we try and do it again, we again talk exactly the same time

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,760
and dissolve in fits of giggles and Jon Franz has.

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,180
And says we have to do it again.

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,540
The beauty of having you record on separate tracks is actually that I can make it sound

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,180
like you didn't talk at the same time.

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,560
But yes, it does sound weird when you're listening to it live.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,360
Yeah, but Claire is very observant and noticed that we do this.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,880
But yes, that is indeed the reason.

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,180
Claire also gave us some corrections.

22
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,140
So she noted that we got the fan fund bounty stuff slightly wrong last week.

23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,660
I did put that in the show notes because I realised I had done it wrong while I was talking about it.

24
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:44,000
But she noted that Fanac doesn't cover the guff trip reports and sci-fi still does.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,080
And they're five years run from the date of the trip rather than from the date of winning the fund.

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,540
So that's good news for Alison.

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,860
Because the date of the trip may be five years after winning the fund.

28
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,740
Indeed.

29
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:04,660
The other thing that Claire mentioned is that she very carefully stores all of her Hugo finalist pins together

30
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,860
and knows precisely where they are, which is extremely organised.

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,400
Alison, do you have any relevant anecdotes about Hugo pins and the care thereof?

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,140
Well, I was thinking about the care of Hugo pins because I have a neighbour who makes giant public artworks

33
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,520
out of little mosaic tiles and she normally generates these tiles in big community workshops

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,280
and I've never quite managed to get to one of them.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,360
These are beautiful and I will put a link to them on the show notes and you can be amazed.

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,640
They are exactly what public art should be like.

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,880
And in lockdown, she worked, she started off being a bit depressed that she couldn't have these big community workshops

38
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,680
and then she realised that she could roll out a lot of tiny little mosaic tiles

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,460
and put them in boxes wet for local families to pick up

40
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,140
and then stamp out the tiles using tools they find around the house and then return them.

41
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,460
And so I have stamped out a load of tiles with a load of things around the house

42
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,160
that are important to me and to my family, including one of my Hugo pins.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,320
Clay is inert.

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,720
It won't have done any permanent damage.

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,340
It does have quite a bit of clay on it now, but, you know, I think that'll be OK.

46
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,540
Not only do I not keep my Hugo pins carefully, but I did manage to find one.

47
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,460
So I thought that was quite good and I will brush the clay off it.

48
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,100
But I also don't tend to look after them very well, for which I'm sorry.

49
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,980
I know it's very important and I should be very grateful.

50
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,200
I mean, I'm very grateful of the pin.

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,360
And my other Hugo abuse anecdote is that, of course, the very first thing I did after winning Hugo,

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,500
apart from brandishing it on an upper deck of a bus, was play ring toss with it.

53
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,600
Did you get a bus tour of London when you won a Hugo, like the cricket team?

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,200
We got a bus tour of Glasgow, which is just as good.

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,360
Ah, it's amazing.

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,100
I didn't know that.

57
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,120
We won the Hugos at the SECC.

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,880
The party was somewhere else in Glasgow.

59
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,200
Was it in the party hotel in Glasgow?

60
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,640
It was in the party hotel.

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,000
And so we got driven by a double-decker bus.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,640
So the Plotka Bowl were on the top of the double-decker bus waving our Hugos around.

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,660
And George R. R. Martin was there waving his Hugo around.

64
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,780
And I asked him where the next book was coming out, which was probably very bad.

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,160
And the next book did come out, but not the one after.

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,220
So, you know, there we go.

67
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,340
And then we went to the Hugo party and it was full of authors and kind of a bit dreary.

68
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,100
And so we came back to the fan lounge in the motor house next to the SECC,

69
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,720
which is really where we should have been all along.

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,480
But we wouldn't have wanted to miss out on riding around on the top of the bus.

71
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,480
Obviously, the population of Glasgow came out and threw ticket a patters.

72
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,040
No, they did not.

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,260
But we imagined it.

74
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,220
Fair enough.

75
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,920
It was one of the best nights of my life, I have to say.

76
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,860
I strongly recommend Winnie Cugos.

77
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,460
I think I also played ring toss at the 2005 Worldcon.

78
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,100
I think I was standing kind of on the balcony around the lobby of the party hotel in Glasgow,

79
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,680
whose name I have forgotten, with a bunch of, I think they were like glow sticks

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,980
and trying to throw them at people down in the lobby.

81
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,560
Didn't do that very long, though.

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,040
I mean, I think the glow sticks rings a bell because I was like,

83
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,340
well, what were we using for the rings?

84
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,880
And I think it was, in fact, glow sticks.

85
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,880
So I think we must have had those little glow sticks that you clipped together and pushed out.

86
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,460
Somebody, somebody who's a proper fan historian is going to remember this in some detail and write to us.

87
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,180
I suspect it will be one Claire Braley of Croydon.

88
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,440
Before we end the anecdote, I should say I was throwing the glow ring at someone who was expecting me to throw the glow ring at them,

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,720
not at, like, completely random people standing in the hotel lobby, which would not be correct.

90
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,980
That's fair.

91
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,460
The other thing I remember from that night is that Cory Doctorow was like,

92
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,620
oh my God, can I hold your Hugo?

93
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,020
So that tells you approximately how old this anecdote is.

94
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,280
The Hugo is just a physical representation of things that actually matters,

95
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,840
which is the acclimation of your friends and peers.

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,120
What we're interested in is validation emotionally.

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,840
We're not interested in physical artifacts on Otto Thorpe.

98
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
We are interested in emotional well-being.

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,540
So do tell us how marvellous the podcast is because we really care about that.

100
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,960
Please, please tell us how great we are.

101
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,620
I will note also that I am highly materialistic,

102
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,800
so I do achieve my emotional well-being by acquiring more things.

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,940
So that is a whole conflict of interest.

104
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,340
We should talk about Con Zealand,

105
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,780
because since we last discussed Con Zealand in any great detail,

106
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,760
they have announced what it is they're doing for Worldcon during the pandemic.

107
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,860
So they have a streaming partner,

108
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,320
which is the, and this is a URL,

109
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,220
this isn't a band name,

110
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,040
which is watch.thefantasy.network, end of URL.

111
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,720
And they have a new pricing structure,

112
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,800
which is £150 or thereabouts for an attending membership.

113
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,840
So approximately US$200.

114
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,880
How do we feel about the fact that the Con Zealand attending membership

115
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,320
is roughly the same as the Discon 3 attending membership,

116
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,900
given the fact that one of those is not happening in the real world,

117
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,000
but in cyberspace?

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,920
I don't think that's a fair comparison,

119
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,720
because the Con Zealand attending membership

120
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
is the actual front up,

121
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,480
right up to the convention attending membership,

122
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,040
whereas the Discon 3 one is the,

123
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,680
is going to be a lot lower than the Discon 3 membership

124
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,980
will be this time next year.

125
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,240
So you're not quite comparing like to like,

126
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,000
but it is certainly,

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,840
it is certainly not cheap.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,220
And when I talked last time about my experience of Easter Con,

129
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,020
being that I didn't go to any programming and then partied with my friends every night.

130
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,580
So it was almost exactly the same as a real Easter Con.

131
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,800
And I drank too much ale.

132
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,760
So it was exactly the same as a real Easter Con,

133
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,300
apart from the fact that I woke up,

134
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,840
you know,

135
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,900
in my own bed at home and didn't have to manage hotels and things.

136
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,660
But also nobody cooked me enormous breakfast,

137
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,840
which was a bit of a shame.

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,000
I do wonder that for people like me,

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,180
who habitually don't attend a lot of the programme,

140
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,320
what the,

141
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,580
I mean,

142
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,060
I am Con Zealand accompanying my membership as the Guff delegate

143
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,460
and I am extremely grateful to them.

144
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,380
Thank you very much.

145
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,920
That is very kind of them.

146
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,860
And I will come along and of course I'll be on programme

147
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,320
and I will do programme-y things during the programme time.

148
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,200
We're going to talk a bit about Guff later,

149
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,180
but for people who aren't me,

150
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,080
but who are kind of party type fans,

151
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,720
I do slightly wonder if the primary benefit of a Worldcon for you

152
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,260
is the socialisation structure,

153
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,240
what it is that you get for your attending membership.

154
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,220
So they do say that as part of their collaboration with the Fantasy Network

155
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,160
that they're going to try and have some,

156
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,620
you know,

157
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,100
as well as the panels and video,

158
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,900
they will also have like networking and late night hanging out

159
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,840
and informal hangouts as well,

160
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,040
which I think they're right.

161
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,980
That is like a key,

162
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,260
a key part of the Worldcon.

163
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,820
You can't just put on some streams of panels

164
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,680
and replicate the Worldcon experience.

165
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,540
You have to include some ways for people to hang out and network.

166
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,380
I think I'm quite pleased to see that they've got this partnership going

167
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,400
because it sounds like they've got some people who are really experienced

168
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,080
at doing sort of video on demand.

169
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,020
And so it will be,

170
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,040
I presume,

171
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,460
all quite nicely done.

172
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,420
There won't be a lot of this.

173
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:03,740
Hello,

174
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,620
are we all on Zoom?

175
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,560
Can you hear me?

176
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:05,740
Oh,

177
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,200
you're on mute.

178
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,120
Please unmute yourself.

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,960
It will presumably work nicely,

180
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,660
which I think is something worth paying for.

181
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,820
And maybe they have a really good way that they do sort of informal hanging out

182
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,860
and social spaces with their current membership.

183
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:27,400
But I do think that £150 is probably more than I want to pay for that experience.

184
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,600
That's fair.

185
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,100
I think it must be very tricky if you're the Con Zealand committee,

186
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,680
because I imagine that £150 is how much they need to charge to make this work.

187
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,240
And that is a tricky thing to get past if you can't sell people on the value.

188
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,000
Obviously,

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,780
they haven't announced what they're doing in terms of the programming or any details about

190
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,560
the social spaces.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,920
Last episode,

192
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,080
or perhaps the episode before,

193
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,480
we were talking about how much you could attend in terms of programming a day.

194
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,900
I think Liz had been on a training course and found it quite exhausting to do eight hours of

195
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,980
content in a single day virtually.

196
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,320
So I'll ask Liz first,

197
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,960
how do you think you can do programming a Worldcon over five days in a way that won't be

198
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,600
exhausting in a similar way?

199
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,260
Well,

200
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,600
I guess the question is,

201
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,280
what do people normally do at Worldcon?

202
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,700
because I think most people do not go and do eight hours of programme on a regular Worldcon day.

203
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,240
And I think it'll be much the same as I would do at a Worldcon,

204
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,800
which is you might pop into one panel or two panels that you really want to see,

205
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,160
and then you'll go and have lunch,

206
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,700
and then maybe you'll intend to go to a panel,

207
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,680
but you'll end up hanging out in the bar instead.

208
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,380
And so actually,

209
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,560
you'll go to maybe three or four panels or items and spend the rest of the time chatting to people.

210
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,620
I think there are a lot of people who do go to conventions and spend a lot of time in the programme,

211
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,640
literally eight hours,

212
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,400
especially when they first get into fandom and do that gosh, wow, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy thing.

213
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,900
I think your first few conventions, you do in fact hit panels continuously.

214
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,220
I mean,

215
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,780
I still talk to people who have been around a few years who sit there checking off things on a programme book and going,

216
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,900
well, I want to see all these things.

217
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,180
I think even more than usual,

218
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,260
when the Worldcon programme book comes out and people see what's there,

219
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,700
I think you're going to get a lot of people wanting to go to a very large number of sessions.

220
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,520
And I think at that point,

221
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:28,260
they'll get a flush of people joining as they realise that they can actually see some very exciting people in environments where they wouldn't necessarily otherwise see them.

222
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:34,900
There are other organisations that already have virtual events of this kind that are very successful.

223
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,480
A lot of gaming and esports things do do virtual conventions and have virtual access.

224
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,320
And they charge quite a lot of money for it.

225
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,520
And people are very happy because they're not incurring the costs of a hotel and all your meals and your travel.

226
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,920
So you get all of that experience of hearing your favourite authors talking to each other,

227
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,240
but without any of the on costs.

228
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,460
And I think for a lot of people, that is quite a good value proposition and it will be fine.

229
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,360
And they will have marvellous programme and people will be amazed by that.

230
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,360
That's my gut feeling.

231
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,300
I don't know what they're actually planning to do.

232
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,180
I mean, the other part is that I would usually spend some of that time hanging out in the dealer's room,

233
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,860
looking at things I can't afford to buy, but I can replicate that online.

234
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,840
One thing they are actually planning to do is have a virtual dealer's room.

235
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,940
And I know this because I'm doing a little bit of the playtesting on being a virtual dealer, which is coming up.

236
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:33,700
The other thing that Liz mentioned is the idea that you would go to a panel and then end up talking to friends in the bar.

237
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,640
How do you replicate the experience of doing that in a virtual convention?

238
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,160
Do either of you have any ideas?

239
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,660
I assume they have to try and replicate it, but...

240
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,600
I have an idea based on Anna Raftery's trip report sessions, which you can come and see,

241
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,760
where we have been running the trip report sessions in Zoom and then having a bar session afterwards.

242
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,460
What you could do for the Worldcon, and I don't know whether they've got this planned,

243
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:12,220
but I am offering it to them as a suggestion, is after each event, you could then have a break into the bar that then breaks into smaller groups so that people can have sensible conversations.

244
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,720
And you could just make that part of what you do for every single item, because that's how real conventions work.

245
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,420
People have an item and then they go off and chat about it in the bar with their mates or people they haven't met yet.

246
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:30,420
So I was looking a bit more at the Fantasy Network team who will be assisting, I think, or running or whatever with ConZealand.

247
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,620
And they have things like they have a Discord channel, they do stuff over Twitch where there will be, you know,

248
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,280
you can watch the chat and watch the item at the same time.

249
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,700
So I think it won't just be we all sit and watch Zoom.

250
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,260
It might be sort of interactive and we are chatting at the same time.

251
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,020
And then we can go on Discord and form a channel to chat about whatever subject we want to later on.

252
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,840
You know, you could even have Discord channels which are going to be, OK, so this is Alison's party room.

253
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,380
And everyone who wants a party with Alison and her friends this evening can go in Alison's party room.

254
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:09,400
I mean, there will be some issues because normally this is not kind of completely open to everyone.

255
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,980
You know, sometimes you go and sit in the bar and have a conversation with friends.

256
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:19,420
And that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone in the convention is going to walk up and join that conversation with you and your friends.

257
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,840
And so I don't know quite how you manage those sort of social spaces which are not kind of public to everyone,

258
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,000
but people can kind of wander in and out.

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,080
But it does seem like they've got a good handle on the sort of tools that might help them do that.

260
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:39,340
I think Alison's right that the ANA model will work very well kind of letting people break into social groups after panels.

261
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:46,060
My concern, I think, is firstly, that means you have to go to panels in order to join the social space,

262
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,520
which is a slight change from how conventions are normally structured.

263
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,760
And secondly, I think that it does mean that there's no equivalent to wandering through the bar

264
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,540
and spotting someone you want to talk to, if that makes sense.

265
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,760
If you don't see someone in the same panels as you, you're not going to bump into them.

266
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,800
For the virtual First Thursday meetings I've done, I've experimented, or I am experimenting,

267
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:17,740
with streaming the list of who is in the bar to Twitch so that when people come into the room,

268
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,800
they can go, who's in the bar already?

269
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,120
Oh, there's these tables and they've got these people at them.

270
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,700
Now, you can't do that for a Worldcon.

271
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,720
I mean, you could do it to some extent, but you can't really do it for a Worldcon

272
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,020
because we have a load of people at Worldcons who, if you did that,

273
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,780
they would kind of do the virtual equivalent of turning their badge around.

274
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,660
You know, they don't want random fans to be able to come up and talk to them

275
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,940
quite all the time or much of the time because they would be mobbed.

276
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,840
And at that point, you could have people say,

277
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,320
oh, and if you don't want to be on the list of who's in the bar so people can't see that you're there,

278
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,480
let me know and I'll make sure your name's not on that list.

279
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,760
So we've got some scope for, but it's still a very blunt hammer compared with

280
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,220
the joy of being able to go through a bar and see people you want to talk to.

281
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,040
But it's quite a refined hammer compared with the not joy of being able to go through a bar

282
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,120
and discovering those 200 people in it and not being able to see the people you want to talk to

283
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,940
because it's too crowded.

284
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,080
Oh, and I don't know if this is secret, but one of the people I've been taught,

285
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,820
because I went to a very big meeting on this exact subject yesterday with Smoth,

286
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:20,960
Smoths.

287
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,380
So just to note that the British term for Smoths is conrunners,

288
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,780
which is an unimaginative but descriptive word.

289
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,000
One of the things I did discuss is I spent some time talking to Stephen Silver about the plans

290
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,820
that he's got for running social spaces at the Nebula weekend.

291
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,460
And I think we should very much watch that and see how that works,

292
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,420
because I think that'll be a very interesting lesson for the community about what works.

293
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,840
I will say that the Nebula conference apparently is $150.

294
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,760
So maybe £150 is the right price point for these things.

295
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,220
Maybe that's just how much it costs.

296
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,660
I didn't realise that.

297
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,380
I'm still excited about Con Zealand.

298
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,400
I think we're at that difficult point where we know that it's going to be strange,

299
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,940
but we don't know all the ways it's going to be good yet.

300
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:09,800
If you were already planning to go to Con Zealand, this will, instead of looking like a very expensive

301
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,860
thing to those of us who weren't planning to go, will look like a bargain way of being able

302
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,960
to maintain your plans in light of everything that's happening.

303
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,540
I think there are also a lot of Americans who always go to the Worldcon,

304
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,840
but could not manage the cost for Con Zealand, particularly having been to Ireland last year.

305
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:36,280
And those people will now for $200 be able to get as much of their Worldcon experience as is available

306
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,780
this year.

307
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,480
Yes.

308
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:44,460
My last thoughts on pricing are, one, that we don't know how much money Con Zealand basically

309
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,480
has already spent and cannot recoup.

310
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,880
So we don't know how much of the money they've already taken in is basically lost on preparation

311
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,120
and payments for the physical spaces that they then can't use.

312
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,060
I will say the other point, though, is that a virtual Worldcon could be a really good opportunity

313
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,020
to bring in new members who actually never get to go to a Worldcon in person because they live

314
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,000
in places where there are never Worldcons and maybe giving them the virtual experience.

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,300
They might then consider coming to a Worldcon because they've managed to get a taste of the experience

316
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,140
and enjoyed it.

317
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:27,820
But I think £150 is going to be too much for the people who might join on a whim.

318
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,140
So I wonder if they might consider having a sort of first Worldcon membership for this

319
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,340
streaming membership.

320
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,600
That touches on something that you mentioned in a previous episode, which was you pointed

321
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,200
out when I was talking about professional conferences that virtually attending a professional conference

322
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,460
is a very good way of lowering barriers to entry to less wealthy people generally.

323
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,700
And I think that is actually a really good thing to bear in mind is that this could be a huge

324
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:02,800
leveler and that as three relatively wealthy middle class white British people, we perhaps

325
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,940
are not the people who can't go to Worldcon because of various circumstances.

326
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,420
I don't want to go into massive details about my finances, but if I decide to go to a Worldcon,

327
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,900
I can save up and I can go to a Worldcon.

328
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,460
That's fine.

329
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,400
But there are so many people for whom that is a statement that sounds insane.

330
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,320
But I sometimes forget parts of my privilege and I am always very grateful when other people

331
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,100
remind me of those parts before I make a giant fool of myself.

332
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,880
I think I'm something like in the 95th percentile on world income scales or maybe a bit higher.

333
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,220
And I could not possibly have imagined ever going to the New Zealand Worldcon on my own time.

334
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,200
So, you know, yes, we could we could theoretically save up and do it.

335
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,420
But, you know, not not at eat.

336
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,780
So I considered it, but I am, you know, basically halfway there already.

337
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,360
And that's the way it would be feasible.

338
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,360
So for me, it's like considering a trip to Europe, except a bit more expensive because

339
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,420
New Zealand is harder to get to.

340
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,600
But that kind of thing.

341
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,360
I am in a similar situation where the reason I did not want to go to New Zealand was because

342
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,100
I couldn't afford it.

343
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,120
But part of that was because I was planning to go to Disney World.

344
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,920
So it's not really a sob story in any meaningful sense.

345
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,380
Except that you didn't get to go to Disney World either.

346
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,860
No, this is this is now that is a sob story.

347
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,380
I'm not going to get my lightsaber, Alison.

348
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,660
My lightsaber.

349
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,240
I knew it, lightsaber I was getting because if you play sorry, huge digression.

350
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,920
If you play Jedi Fallen Order, they used the same lightsaber parts as you get in Galaxy

351
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,260
Edge.

352
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,720
So I had built the lightsaber I was going to buy in Galaxy's Edge in Fallen Order.

353
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,440
And I knew which crystals I was going to have.

354
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,700
And I was so excited.

355
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,000
And now, yeah.

356
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,600
John, there is a potential silver lining to this, which is that I'm also not going to

357
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,460
Disney World this year.

358
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,740
So maybe we could go to Disney World at some point in the future at the same time.

359
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,260
The listeners cannot see the excited hand motions I am making, but you can see you know how excited

360
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,580
I am.

361
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,920
So the last thing I want to ask you about New Zealand is, as far as I know, Con Zealand haven't

362
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,740
yet announced what time zone they're planning to run their program in.

363
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,540
We've speculated previously that they would probably pick a time zone that would favor New

364
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,240
Zealanders and US fans.

365
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,040
But do either of you have any thoughts about what makes sense in that regard?

366
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,820
And have any of you heard anything about what they might be planning to do?

367
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,840
I have not heard anything about what they might be planning to do.

368
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,880
I think it makes sense to prioritize New Zealanders first and then what time zone will allow the

369
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,760
maximum number of your members to attend.

370
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,160
I'm resigned to this as it means I would probably be able to attend like really weirdly

371
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,640
timed things like possibly parties at 7am my time and the Hugos at lunchtime or something

372
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,160
like that.

373
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,800
But that's just going to happen.

374
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,260
My understanding is that we should be getting an announcement on this quite soon.

375
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,420
There's been obviously, as you can imagine, quite a lot of thinking and working around

376
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:52,820
the issue.

377
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,280
But I understand that that's coming to a conclusion and you should expect it to be resolved.

378
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,160
And they're going to try and make a decision that works the best for Con Zealand and for

379
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,540
their members.

380
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,820
So I think we're still expecting a lot of announcements for New Zealand.

381
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,960
And there's a lot of work going on to work out exactly what these will be.

382
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
But I think, you know, things are happening.

383
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,100
And I think fairly soon the white smoke will go up.

384
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,300
You expect the white to go up?

385
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,040
We're electing a new Pope of all Wilcons.

386
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,920
Yay!

387
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,140
Space Pope.

388
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,660
I vote for Vince Doherty.

389
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,740
Vince would pull off the robes.

390
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,040
But I mean, we're obviously not Wilcon chairs because, you know, there are some things that

391
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,080
you don't do if you've got any sense at all.

392
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,600
Because you and Liz haven't had time to do that yet and I'm not stupid enough.

393
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,760
No, no, seriously.

394
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,240
I was about to say you and Liz probably still have that as a plan, but I'm not stupid enough.

395
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,960
Imagine a Wilcon chaired by me and John.

396
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,300
I'm imagining it so hard, Liz.

397
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,040
I will not even imagine it.

398
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,120
I will give you £10 to pre-support it right now.

399
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,280
Oh, man.

400
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,140
All you need to do is pick a year.

401
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:04,360
I'm going to go for £21.50 on the basis that if I am still alive, I'll presumably be wise

402
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,400
enough to do it by then.

403
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,600
You'll be in a vat.

404
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,740
Liz, ever going to chair a Wilcon?

405
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,580
No.

406
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,500
She did not deny as fast as either of us did.

407
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,640
I thought that there might be, like, I can see coming back to this in like 25 years or

408
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,800
something when I do chair a Wilcon and someone digs this soundbite and goes, ha ha.

409
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,120
So I thought, should I hedge a bit?

410
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,480
But then I'm like, no, I'm not going to chair a Wilcon.

411
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,580
I'm going to say no.

412
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,260
I would strongly recommend not bothering about that because if you did chair a Wilcon, you

413
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,540
go, yeah, well, people change.

414
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:42,440
And if you don't deny it very firmly all the time, then you will find yourself chairing a

415
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:42,680
Wilcon.

416
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,540
That is how it works.

417
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:49,540
I think we are following and actually we have sufficient people who want to chair Wilcons

418
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,280
right now.

419
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,700
And I also think chairing a Wilcon is maybe a full-time job at this point.

420
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,400
And I already have a full-time job.

421
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,920
And of course, my part-time podcasting hobby.

422
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,280
That's exactly it.

423
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:08,360
We do have a surfeit of people who want to chair Wilcon and rather too few who want to do

424
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
all the work.

425
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,680
Yes.

426
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,800
I'd love to chair a Wilcon if someone else would do all the work.

427
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,180
You heard it here first.

428
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:22,980
On the subject of time zones, Alison, you have an itinerary for your guff trip.

429
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,720
Do you want to talk to us about that?

430
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,540
I do.

431
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,400
I was originally planning to not fly directly.

432
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,520
I'm going to do the entire experience virtually.

433
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,540
And I think I might have trailed this last time, but I hadn't really set any of it up when

434
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,080
we were talking before.

435
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
So now I have a Facebook group.

436
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,140
It's called something like Alison Scott's Virtual Guff Trip.

437
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,620
That will probably find it for you.

438
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,220
Where if you are interested, you can join and help me plan it.

439
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,840
If you're not on Facebook, then get in touch and I will send you the stuff.

440
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,220
And you could also give me your thoughts.

441
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,640
I'm particularly interested in people in Australia and New Zealand.

442
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,400
I am planning to do stopovers.

443
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,780
I was originally only going to do one on the way back because my logic was that I would be

444
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:08,560
not flying nonstop from Heathrow to Perth, as that is now not possible.

445
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,480
But if it were possible, that would be how I would be flying.

446
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,820
But now the West Coast of the US people have said, well, why can't you do a stopover on

447
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,780
the West Coast of the US?

448
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:23,460
And I'm hoping to organise a stopover in the other direction in either Shanghai or Japan.

449
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,820
So it's practically around the world tour at this point.

450
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,520
Thailand.

451
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,000
Stop in Thailand.

452
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,660
You very rarely get to speak to Liz.

453
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,120
It had not occurred to me to stop in Thailand.

454
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,320
And I'd like to say, well, Pete Young is also in Thailand.

455
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,840
But of course, Pete Young is actually holed up in Stoke.

456
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,920
So not in Thailand at all.

457
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,040
How hot is it where you are, Liz?

458
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,580
It's been in the high 30s.

459
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,240
Yes.

460
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,460
OK.

461
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,040
So that's one of the nice things about going on a virtual guff trip is that it will not

462
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,900
be that hot.

463
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,660
The other nice thing is that because it's going to be summer in the UK and winter in New Zealand,

464
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,160
New Zealand's 11 hours ahead of us rather than 13 hours ahead of us, which I think will be

465
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,000
quite a bit worse in terms of managing it.

466
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,220
But I am going to go on to Australia, first Australian time and then New Zealand time for

467
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,640
three weeks.

468
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,260
I'm going to get one of the other sort of face masks, the one you wear on a plane that covers

469
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,380
your eyes so that you can sleep in your very light bedroom in the middle of the day and

470
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:26,240
go on to the night shift for three weeks and hopefully meet lots of Australian fans.

471
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:33,820
I'm planning, I'm definitely, I've definitely got plans for Perth, Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney,

472
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,340
Adelaide, Hobart, Wellington in already.

473
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,600
So I'm definitely going to go to lots of bits of Australia virtually and see their local

474
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,760
attractions virtually and hopefully I asked for ideas for cooking the local food and everyone

475
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,280
comes back with junk food.

476
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:57,200
I think the only actual plausible recipe that's not, you know, either this is an interesting

477
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,140
sort of biscuit that you can probably get hold of or roast kangaroo is chicken parmigiana,

478
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,800
which apparently is an Australian speciality.

479
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,740
So I will have some of that.

480
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,340
But in the near future, I'm going to have the Middlesbrough equivalent of chicken parmigiana,

481
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,820
which is called a parmo.

482
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,600
And it's where you get some chicken, you flatten it, you breadcrumb it, you whack some

483
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,340
bechamel sauce and some cheddar on it.

484
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,660
And then you put toppings on it like it's a pizza and it comes in a giant box.

485
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,320
And that is the Middlesbrough equivalent of the Australian delicacy you have just outlined.

486
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,940
And there is a place that delivers them now in Southampton.

487
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,480
So yes.

488
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,560
But if you've got anywhere in London that does parmos, you might be able to get a sort of

489
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,300
British take on it delivered.

490
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,740
Authentic one.

491
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,680
Yeah, that sounds really good.

492
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,260
I mean, because delivery food is definitely an option here.

493
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,520
And in general, getting Australian wine and beer delivered seems like part of the plan as well.

494
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,140
So it's coming on nicely.

495
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,260
And I have quite a lot of, you know, people are coming up with some quite nice things.

496
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:03,140
There's some questions about how we're going to get some famously reclusive Australian fans

497
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,980
to try Zoom or Discord or some other video conferencing solution of their choice.

498
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,580
But it's quite interesting because it turns out that my trip is, I'm doing three weeks

499
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,120
plus travel.

500
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,240
It's quite full, even despite the fact that I'm not going anywhere.

501
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:28,500
And it really brings home how difficult it must be to plan a fan fun trip and not die in the attempt.

502
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,480
No, it is.

503
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,560
It's, I remember planning my fan fun trip.

504
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,820
I did it when I was in my final year of my undergrad degree.

505
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,920
And I did it very much as an undergraduate, as I mentioned on Anna's trip report.

506
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,920
But I think my entire month long trip clocked in at something like £1,200.

507
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,160
I'm going to spend more than that.

508
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,920
Yeah, I should have spent more than that.

509
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,120
I was going to say, I might spend more than that.

510
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,980
Even virtually.

511
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,120
Ha ha!

512
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,740
No, I did it really.

513
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,120
I took the absolute cheapest flights I possibly could at every juncture.

514
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,220
And I was bewilderingly frugal.

515
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,360
We should bully Liz into running for guff.

516
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,700
Liz, run for guff.

517
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,180
Come to England from Thailand.

518
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,860
Is that a good guff trip?

519
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,200
Ha ha!

520
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,080
I do not think Thailand falls under the remit of guff, John.

521
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,240
Ha ha ha!

522
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,220
I'm not sure if I need to send you a map with some scribbles on it to explain where countries are.

523
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,540
But it is not, in fact, in Australia or New Zealand.

524
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,580
So I'm torn here because obviously I could just look at a map.

525
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:34,500
But equally, the notion of receiving mail from Thailand that is just Liz annotating maps of the world being like,

526
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,980
Australia, arrow, not Australia, arrow.

527
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,400
That would be...

528
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,440
I would not say no, Liz.

529
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,200
That would make my friggin' year.

530
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,220
Liz, are you nearer or further from here than you are from Australia?

531
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,960
I am closer to Australia, I believe.

532
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,300
I'm about the same distance between the UK and New Zealand.

533
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,880
I'm not entirely sure on that.

534
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,800
Yeah, so only really halfway.

535
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,420
Yeah, I am really sort of halfway.

536
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:10,360
I did look up how long it would take me, you know, to go to New Zealand for the Worldcon,

537
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,720
thinking, oh, I must be like most of the way there.

538
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,820
No, it's still a very long trip.

539
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,520
So I don't want to be too dramatic about fan funds.

540
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,680
People can run for fan funds if they think they should run for a fan fund.

541
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:29,500
But I do think there's something nice about having fan fund delegates who have not otherwise visited the place,

542
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,740
or maybe visited the place once a very long time ago for a short while,

543
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:39,260
and are now getting to do something that without the fan funds would not be a practical journey for them.

544
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,860
I don't want to say it's a requirement or anything like that, because it clearly isn't and shouldn't be.

545
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:51,860
But it's one of the things I think about when voting is how much would I not expect to be able to see this person otherwise.

546
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,660
Yes, I don't think John was entirely serious that I should run for a fan fund.

547
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:02,760
But I would not consider running for a fan fund unless I was living in one of the places in the fan fund.

548
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,960
Anyone would like to start a fan fund to just send people to come and visit me?

549
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,900
That's fine.

550
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,680
And I will take them out and show them around.

551
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,000
But I think that's called a holiday fund, probably.

552
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,460
When I was still enthusiastic and young, me and Claire talked about doing a fan fund called OOF,

553
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,740
which would be the out-of-the-ordinary fan fund for conventions which were not in traditionally served countries.

554
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:32,400
I don't know if you remember when Chris O'Shea went to Japan, he won Jets, which was a one-off fan fund.

555
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,000
But I thought it'd be funny to have a fan fund called OOF.

556
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,880
Was he going to do a trip report?

557
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,260
No, of course not.

558
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,420
So we've talked about Alison's guff trip.

559
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,200
Was there anything else either of the rest of you wanted to say about it,

560
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,360
apart from come to Thailand and I'll show you around?

561
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,820
Well, I think we should, when you're visiting Liz on your stopover in Asia on your way back.

562
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:56,180
I could stop over everywhere in Asia on my way back from Australia all in the same day, couldn't I?

563
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:02,660
Yeah, but we should do a live recording of your stopover at Liz's house

564
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,200
and we should let people ask questions about your trip and that would be fantastic.

565
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,200
And I'll be in Thai time.

566
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,320
So when would suit you, Liz?

567
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,360
Well, now it's fine, it's a thing.

568
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,260
Oh, OK.

569
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,380
What time is it there?

570
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,900
Like, tea time?

571
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,960
7.30.

572
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,940
Yeah, OK.

573
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,320
So that's what we'll do?

574
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,240
Well, yeah, we could...

575
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,560
All right.

576
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,780
We'll do a virtual guff.

577
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,880
I'm not sure what...

578
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,820
It won't be Sunday, though.

579
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,420
That's my problem.

580
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,520
It's going to be midweek, so...

581
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,040
That's fine.

582
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,120
We will cope.

583
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,520
I'll get it to the diary because I think a live Octothorpe from Thailand.

584
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,880
Shall we discuss staying sane in the apocalypse for a few minutes before we clock off?

585
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,780
We're expecting some slight lockdown reductions today, but I don't think they're going to be

586
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,400
very specific.

587
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,300
I think most things are going to be...

588
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,920
You'll be allowed to go out to exercise more than once a day if you're a very enthusiastic

589
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,400
gym bunny.

590
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,480
But otherwise, it is much of the same.

591
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,260
We hoped we would have a podcasting studio in our back room, and that's not worked quite

592
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,600
as well.

593
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,480
In fact, we found that we're struggling to get internet across our whole house, and it seems

594
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,440
to be because our internet provider is struggling to put as much internet as it is contractually

595
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,900
obligated to into the street as everybody in the world uses all of their internet all the

596
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,160
time.

597
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:23,100
And this has been getting steadily worse over the period as people have managed to train

598
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,800
their elderly relatives in using video conferencing.

599
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,420
And all those years that they said, oh, people don't need as much upload as they have download,

600
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,460
that turned out to be wrong, didn't it?

601
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,460
Boys and girls.

602
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,220
So...

603
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,980
But otherwise, I'm much less...

604
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,080
Because I was quite insane last time, and I've cheered up quite a bit since then.

605
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,960
That's good.

606
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,500
England is currently having kind of the world's worst outbreak, which is strange and

607
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,820
not necessarily what we expected.

608
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,920
So that's quite bad.

609
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,000
That might improve.

610
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:58,920
I am playing a play-by-post game of the Arkham Horror board game, where a man who lives not

611
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,540
far from me has set up a board in the room with his piano in it.

612
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,740
And he records YouTube videos every night of what happened.

613
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,280
And then the next day, we tell him what we want our characters to do, and he does it.

614
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,140
And then we send him photographs of the dice that we have rolled.

615
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,000
And then he does another YouTube video explaining what happened.

616
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,700
And we continue on like that.

617
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:24,380
Which is an incredibly surreal thing that I never would have thought to do before I wasn't

618
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,180
allowed out of my house.

619
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,220
But it is strangely soothing.

620
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:32,080
It is very nice and relaxing and a wonderful way to play board games.

621
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,380
So I recommend making friends with someone who has a board game permanently set up in their

622
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,020
house and send you YouTube videos of how it's going.

623
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,980
This may not be as broadly applicable as previous episodes have been.

624
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,160
Alternatively, I can highly recommend playing board games with people on Tabletop Simulator,

625
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,400
as John and I have been playing board games on Tabletop Simulator.

626
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,980
And it is extremely funny because John has played all the scenarios before.

627
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,440
And so when we have to make a very important decision, like, should we read the Necronomicon

628
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,140
and keep its forbidden knowledge, or should we destroy it?

629
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:10,960
I can see John on the video sitting there trying very hard not to influence us to do the sensible

630
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,540
thing.

631
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,080
You should destroy it and never...

632
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,240
I mean, I think I haven't played this game, but I'm 99% certain that's the correct answer.

633
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,340
The correct answer was destroy the Necronomicon.

634
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,760
And we did destroy the Necronomicon.

635
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,480
The problem is that there are arguments for and against Liz, and I know what those arguments

636
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:30,920
are.

637
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,360
I know.

638
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,100
I know what happens if you pick either one.

639
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,440
I cannot confirm nor deny that you picked the right option.

640
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,820
Which is good for if you want to play it again.

641
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,380
All right.

642
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,340
We are pretty sure that destroying an Necronomicon was the correct thing to do.

643
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,040
But I am also, like, allowed to leave the house and things because we're in phase one of

644
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,860
lifting restrictions.

645
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,020
So, I mean, we never had, I think, quite such a strict lockdown as the UK did.

646
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,580
But we are sort of back to you can work 50-50 in the office.

647
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,660
So try and keep the office 50% empty.

648
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,840
Restaurants are reopening with quite a lot of restrictions on seating distances and things

649
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,480
like that.

650
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,220
handful of other things have reopened, like parks and golf courses.

651
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,940
And if all goes well, at the end of next week, we might go on to the next phase.

652
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,240
So I may not need these coping measures for all that long.

653
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,740
Although I'm still working from home pretty much full time.

654
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,940
I've observed that we started off buying a little bit of cheese, the amount of cheese we would

655
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,780
normally buy.

656
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:38,920
And gradually, as the lockdown has extended, we've started to buy more and more cheese.

657
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:44,160
So each week, a greater proportion of the food we eat is cheese.

658
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,140
And a greater proportion of the meals that we eat are formed of going, oh, nobody really

659
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,020
fancies cooking.

660
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,940
I'll just eat some cheese.

661
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,900
I have been doing some jigsaws.

662
00:36:53,900 --> 00:37:00,060
We still have, we have kind of a jigsaw transfer network around the COVID mutual aid group now.

663
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:06,200
So all the jigsaws are getting passed around, which is good because the street value of jigsaws

664
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,120
has trebled in the last two months.

665
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,060
If you have any mechanism for selling jigsaws, I would recommend that.

666
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,940
I am, I've also noticed as well as my cheese intake going up, my beer intake is going up

667
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:25,560
gradually that as I've worked out more and better ways to socialize online, I find I'm doing

668
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,900
it more and therefore I'm, it's more effective and therefore I drink more beer.

669
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,560
My daughter said sadly yesterday, but there's so much theatre.

670
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,600
We'd never normally go to the theatre every week.

671
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:44,140
And, and yet there are all these theatre things and they come on every week and they only last

672
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,020
for a few days.

673
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,640
And so yes, lots of theatre, lots of highbrow entertainment is being provided for our enjoyment.

674
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,600
My, part of my staying sane at the apocalypse is that I have bought a new microphone and the

675
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,620
microphone has not appeared.

676
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,800
I have not been charged for the microphone.

677
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,640
I don't know when I will be charged for the microphone.

678
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,940
I don't know how to cancel the microphone.

679
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,480
It's all very stressful because I found out that Argos sells this microphone and buying directly

680
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,820
from the manufacturer might have been worse than buying from Argos, which seems backwards

681
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,460
to me.

682
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,480
One of the things that people don't always know is that if Argos has the thing in stock

683
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,720
and will get it to you, they are often the very best option for getting your thing, especially

684
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,360
if it's kind of a small electrical thing because they, they just kind of bring it right round.

685
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,520
And you can also, they also do click and collect from Sainsbury's.

686
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,880
So I would click and collect from Sainsbury's.

687
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,020
I think, I assume that still works at the moment.

688
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,240
Yeah, it does.

689
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,720
There has been some discussion about whether it should work.

690
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,980
There's massive tension at the moment between the people who don't want the economy to collapse

691
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,480
and the people who don't want everyone to die of the plague, which is, you know, fair.

692
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,980
But the people who don't want the economy to collapse are like, Argos has all these sites

693
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,360
in supermarkets, which means it got a huge benefit over every other retail stop because

694
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,700
it had to shut its main retail sites, but it could continue to operate its entire business

695
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,200
through these click and collect sites.

696
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,040
And then the people who wanted the economy to survive went, well, actually, that's okay.

697
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,960
We do not want the economy to collapse.

698
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,980
So letting people, making it possible for people to buy manufactured goods is no bad.

699
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,840
Yeah, I think I'm not going mad, but I am ordering a lot online.

700
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,620
When you do get your microphone from Sainsbury's, you will also have to buy your groceries.

701
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,560
Oh, yes.

702
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,520
Sorry, I should clarify.

703
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,680
We have the largest.

704
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,420
Sainsbury's in my city is a five minute walk up the road.

705
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,080
And so I do my grocery shopping there.

706
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,780
Used to do it all the way back from work whenever we needed bits.

707
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,520
Now I do it every two weeks in giganto shops, which I am still not really used to.

708
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,320
And the sticker shock of spending two weeks worth of groceries in one go is still a little

709
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,900
bit like, what?

710
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,220
Is that really how much spending?

711
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,040
Yes, it is.

712
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,020
Especially if you've got cats.

713
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,980
You should try having four adults in the house.

714
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,480
I don't think I should try that, Alison.

715
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,460
I think two adults and two cats.

716
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,860
And a very big hang of cheese.

717
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,900
On the subject of that, we've been drinking much more beer.

718
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,960
Like, we are ordering six pints a week from the pub across the road.

719
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,100
Before lockdown, we never used to drink that much beer in the pub across the road.

720
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,960
But now we do.

721
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,480
One of the ways I'm staying sane in the apocalypse is to play board games with members of my own

722
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:22,980
household.

723
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,840
I have been doing that as well.

724
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,160
Because I grew some.

725
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:33,940
So that is the upside of having children and then waiting 20 years, is that you can then

726
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,600
play board games with them in lockdown.

727
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:43,720
I actually logged my 800th board game yesterday, or my 800th play yesterday, which was a game

728
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,620
of Arkham Horror the Card Game with my lovely wife.

729
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,240
We got our arses handed to us in the Carnival in Venice.

730
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,300
That was very embarrassing.

731
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,860
Turns out that I did not have the ability to kill enough cultists, and that was a problem.

732
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,480
But yes, I've also been playing a lot of games with the Spanier.

733
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,020
And also watching a lot of movies with the Spanier.

734
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,680
And also Animal Crossing.

735
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,240
And I posted a very adorable picture to Facebook of a kitchen.

736
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,840
We basically designed an entire Animal Crossing kitchen.

737
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,120
And then we'd filled it up with turnips, because one of the features of Animal Crossing is that

738
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,820
you end up with a lot of turnips in your home.

739
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,240
And said, oh, I'm having trouble with my veg box.

740
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,520
Does anyone have any ideas on what you can do with turnips?

741
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:26,380
And one person accurately identified that the answer was, sell them for a fat profit on Wednesday

742
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,300
afternoons.

743
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,500
And everybody else gave me ideas for using turnips.

744
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,000
Despite the fact that they were obviously cartoon turnips on the floor of a cartoon kitchen.

745
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:46,040
Marianne, my daughter is in her final term at Oxford and had a large, not quite thesis to hand in.

746
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,980
And this has obviously been a source of stress in her household.

747
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,800
And it was due at noon on Thursday.

748
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,820
And at 11.52 on Thursday, she uploaded it and got the confirmation thing to say.

749
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,800
It was great.

750
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,620
And we were like, oh, that's lovely, darling.

751
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,200
Well done.

752
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,060
You can relax now.

753
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,480
She was like, no, we only have eight minutes to sell our turnips.

754
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,700
Because there is a stock market in Animal Crossing where you sell turnips at a high price.

755
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,980
If you don't sell them within a week, they rot and you have a pile of rotten turnips.

756
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:22,780
So you use turnip price predictor apps on the internet to tell you how much your turnips will sell for.

757
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:42,840
And so the eight minutes after her getting her essay in for the deadline, while we were trying to get roomfuls of turnips sold before the bell rang at noon, was much more stressful than any part of the preceding two hours of exactly what format does this need to be in and how do the citations need to be.

758
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,800
But the essay has gone in and I made half a million bells selling turnips.

759
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,740
Yay!

760
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,840
Excellent.

761
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,320
So that's probably more than you want to know about Animal Crossing.

762
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,160
The world's an odd place.

763
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,560
It's not just me.

764
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:11,320
The Financial Times had a long article about Animal Crossing and the bank of Animal Crossing and the steps that have been taken to avoid cheats in Animal Crossing and the virtual turnip market that I've just described to you.

765
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,560
And it was played not for laughs at all, really.

766
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,200
It basically said it was obviously a funny article, but it wasn't April Fool's because I checked repeatedly.

767
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:29,900
They just thought that it would be funny to have an article about turnip trading and Animal Crossing in the middle of the FT because people need that sort of thing these days.

768
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,060
Thanks everyone for listening to the fifth episode of the Octothorpe podcast.

769
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,040
We will see you in a fortnight's time.

770
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,020
But for now, it's goodbye from me.

771
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,540
And it's goodbye from me.

772
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,080
And it's goodbye from me.

773
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:46,360
The music used in this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin MacLeod at incompetech.com.

774
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,300
Licensed under a Creative Commons BY 3.0 license.

775
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,620
Yay, that's a wrap.

776
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,760
Now, of course, there is the after show thing.

777
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,640
So I have spent a lot on Arkham Horror.

778
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,640
I'd be surprised.

779
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,020
It must be about 700 or 800 pounds.

780
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,600
Isn't that quite a lot of money?

781
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,880
That's all right.

782
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,860
That's why I can't go to New Zealand, Alison, because I've spent it all on board games.

783
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,920
No, no, no, no.

784
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,120
It's not quite a lot of money for a board game.

785
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,520
Because I was kind of like thinking about whether we wanted to buy Gloomhaven.

786
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,940
And it seemed like quite a lot of money for a board game.

787
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,440
Gloomhaven is quite a lot.

788
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,500
So my answer is it depends what you think a lot of money is.

789
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,600
And I don't know whether that makes sense.

790
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,120
How do you manage to spend?

791
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,800
So Gloomhaven may or may not be value for money.

792
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,760
So Gloomhaven is almost certainly value.

793
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,000
The differentiation is between expense and value.

794
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,080
So Gloomhaven is 120 quid, which is quite a lot of money.

795
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,580
If you buy Gloomhaven, you will almost certainly play it for at least 120 hours,

796
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:02,700
which means it's probably cheaper per hour of entertainment than a book or a movie or a video game.

797
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,180
OK, so will we is the question.

798
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,040
Will my family actually get us together to play it?

799
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,000
That is very much a question for you and your play group.

800
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,980
So we have some other cooperative games and we were going to go,

801
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,900
well, we're going to play some of those and see if we play them enough to make Gloomhaven worthwhile.

802
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,180
But if Gloomhaven is just majestically better than those.

803
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,660
I have controversial opinions about Gloomhaven.

804
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,820
I think it is OK.

805
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,820
I don't understand why it's the top of the Game Geek rankings.

806
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,180
It just makes no sense at all to me.

807
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:36,340
It is a competently done dungeon crawler with a relatively minimal layer of narrative on top.

808
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,100
If that is your bag, you'll probably really like it.

809
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,440
If that is not your bag, you might not.

810
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,620
It is available on Tabletop Simulator in a version which is sanctioned by the designer.

811
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,980
So if you want to know whether it is your cup of tea, you could play through the TTS mod.

812
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,860
The only thing I will say is that I personally feel like when you're playing a TTS mod,

813
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:01,280
you have to bear in mind that it is probably more clunky than playing the actual game.

814
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:07,380
Because, well, just playing board games on virtual interfaces tends to be a little bit less tactile, less good.

815
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,480
But as long as you bear that in mind, it's a good way of trying it out.

816
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,860
In terms of Arkham Horror, so buying the base set is £30.

817
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:22,880
The way that it works is that you can buy expansions which are big-ish boxes which cost about £25.

818
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,240
And then you can buy smaller packs of cards which are called Mythos packs which run you about £12.

819
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,360
And if you buy one of these big boxes and the six associated small boxes,

820
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:38,480
that is a single story told over eight scenarios of a campaign.

821
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,600
So to do that runs you somewhere in the region of £100 to buy like one eight-scenario campaign.

822
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,800
What I will say is that that is £100.

823
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,700
But so far, with the one that I've spent £100 on, which is the first one they did was the Dunwich Legacy.

824
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,640
I played that once through with my wife and my friend Michael.

825
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,180
I'm playing it once through with Liz and Hogg and Ian.

826
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,080
And I'm playing it once through with my friend Ian.

827
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:08,280
So by the time I have gotten my play out of that for the foreseeable future,

828
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,700
I would play through it three times.

829
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:14,400
And if you say each game is somewhere in the region of 90 minutes to two and a half hours,

830
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,380
that means that I've spent about 60 hours, 50 to 60 hours playing it,

831
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,860
which works out to about £2 an hour.

832
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,220
And that doesn't include the fun my friends have had with it.

833
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,780
So that's back to this general question about,

834
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,280
with any investment purchase, will you actually play it?

835
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,940
So that's the problem we have with the family.

836
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,380
Because although I say, well, we play board games with the family,

837
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,320
we don't actually do that that much.

838
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,440
We do play a lot of video games together,

839
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,640
but we don't play an enormous number of board games.

840
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,460
Although we all like board games and agree we should do it more.

841
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,480
I think if you're trying to get into playing board games,

842
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,220
I would set yourself like a, there's a thing called a 10 by 10 challenge,

843
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,700
which is when you play 10 board games 10 times over the course of a year.

844
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,420
And if you've got 10 board games in your collection already that you like,

845
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:06,480
I would set yourself one of those and try and get the habit before splashing a huge amount of cash

846
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,240
on something that's heavily scenario-based.

847
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:14,180
The other thing I would say is if you're looking for a game to play cooperatively over a series of sessions,

848
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:18,800
it's my impression that Pandemic Legacy is a bit more accessible than Bloomhaven.

849
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,460
It's certainly half the price.

850
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,000
The only problem is you only get to play it 12 to 24 times.

851
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,860
Yeah, I'm not playing any game on a Pandemic theme this year.

852
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,840
That's fair.

853
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,920
Is that not reasonable?

854
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,760
I mean, no, I think that's absolutely reasonable.

855
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,520
The thing I would say about Arkham is you can buy the base set for 30 quid.

856
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,400
And if you hate it, you can sell it for 20 quid.

857
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,740
And then you're 10 quid in the hole.

858
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,200
And that's not that bad.

859
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,880
If you buy Gloomhaven and you don't like it,

860
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,280
it's potentially a lot more money that you've thrown down a drain.

861
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,880
Yeah, though you can buy a reusable sticker pack.

862
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,140
So one of the options for Gloomhaven is to buy it and its reusable sticker pack.

863
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,180
So you do not, in fact, mark up your game permanently.

864
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,420
Though I'm not sure how practical that is.

865
00:48:59,420 --> 00:48:59,840
Anyway.

866
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,480
I'm on hold with the help centre.

867
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,360
This is very annoying.

868
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,800
And I have no Mexican food.

869
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,680
Who?

870
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,180
Who named three condos in the same area with very similar names?

871
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,480
Thailand.

872
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,580
Is that helpful?

873
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:36,640
Is that what you needed, John?

874
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,940
Yeah, I could edit that.

875
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,820
It's something coherent.

876
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,680
Something.
