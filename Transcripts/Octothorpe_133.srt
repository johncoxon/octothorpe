1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
 How do I do the beginning of the podcast again?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,000
 It's written literally on the first line of the show notes.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to Octothorpe Live.

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,640
 I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. So first up who oh in this episode is episode

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:43,440
 130 something 33 and it is coming to you on a day. Thursday? Thursday. Whatever Thursday was when

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,320
 we were recording this. In three days I get to have to edit it yeah. Thursday the 24th of April

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,040
 2025 and that will be our longest gap ever between episodes I think. What oh maybe not because we

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,680
 don't know because we just skip on one. Right so firstly by show of hands actually know by

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,960
 cheering who here listens to the Octothorpe podcast. Who here has never before listened to the

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:17,360
 Octothorpe podcast? Two people. You only watch it live. That's I mean that is I did not know we

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,560
 had Octothorpe hipsters in the audience. That is really immensely. Hello person welcome I'm John

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,960
 this is Alison and this is Liz. Okay could the person who's working on the zoom for tech

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,080
 please do the thing that stops the audio from cutting out whenever there's a loud noise.

14
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,640
 Thank you. See I love you tech. Thank you Kat.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,960
 Yeah we're gonna have a big cheer for tech to check if it's working now so could you give a big cheer

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,400
 for tech? Yay!

17
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:01,120
 Sorted. All right um so Liz. Yes. How's your EasterCon bit? Pretty good.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,640
 Boy. And that was the Octothorpe podcast.

19
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,520
 There are very good reasons why we do this podcast on the Monday of EasterCon usually which is we

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,640
 get to do a nice recap of the weekend but it does mean we always do the podcast when we're all almost

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,360
 dead. Yep. We were all sitting around at breakfast this morning going.

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:33,760
 Which is fascinating radio. So yeah so there have been panels there have been things that we've done

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,920
 there's been cosplay so yeah how people found the program should we start the program? Yeah

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,480
 there's been a program. I think the highlight for me was the Hay Lecture which this year

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,200
 was given so how many people saw the Hay Lecture?

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:59,040
 So this year the Hay Lecture was given by Dr Liz Batty and so if you didn't see the Hay Lecture

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,240
 you should watch Tom Kachup because it was fabulous and I thought I knew a lot of this stuff

28
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,800
 already but in fact Liz taught me lots of things I did not already know and I really enjoyed it

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,720
 so thank you very much her slides are a bit fuzzy. Next time you do this you could get me to

30
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,600
 my slides and my laptop are perfect. That is always the way there are always technical hiccups.

31
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,080
 You can tell people who are good at giving talks because they do not let the technical hiccups

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,360
 jostle them. I also like very good. Alison's admission that I might know things that Alison doesn't know

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,080
 but she could fix my slides.

34
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,960
 [Laughter]

35
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,640
 You might be able to fix your slides. I'm a fixer. You've got slides? I could fix them.

36
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,480
 I do have tech whispering to some extent because I always cause a lot of trouble for the tech

37
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,120
 every year. Hey we you know we're a team. We all... Yes I think somewhere in a

38
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,920
 Mac-to-Windows transition some of my images went a bit fuzzy but you know that happens sometimes.

39
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,840
 No and it was good it was really good. It might have been my favourite programme.

40
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,720
 I think it's very good. I feel it's like if I had a fanning bingo card that would be like a big

41
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:18,480
 box ticked off. Oh oh god you've given me aspirations. Because I've never given the BSFA lecture either.

42
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:27,280
 If anyone from the BSFA is listening I believe that is what they call the hint.

43
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,200
 I am not in fact an academic of any type and I missed the BSFA lecture was Fiona Moore who is

44
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,400
 also a friend of the podcast I would say and I would definitely have gone to that. Unfortunately

45
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,760
 it was opposite the bid session. Fiona I'm going to see that on catch up and I'm very much looking

46
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,640
 forward to that. I mean I did go to that instead of the bid session because someone told me the

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,680
 bid session was full and also you can pick up most of the bid session exciting info on Discord where

48
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,760
 it's very hard to pick up an entire lecture on Discord so yeah the the BSFA lecture was great.

49
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,000
 Made me think a lot both about diversity management and also made me want to reread Lord of the Rings.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,840
 Oh have you never read Lord of the Rings? I'm just going to read it and then she's going to read it.

51
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,000
 I've also never given the re-slecture. If this episode is going to be a list of lectures you've

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,400
 never given it's going to take a really long time. I have to give because we mentioned on a previous

53
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,280
 podcast that I won an award in my day job and I have to give a lecture as a result and I...

54
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,800
 Can we come? Can we come? I don't know. No you've got to wait a few years until John gives that as

55
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,040
 the hey lecture. It'll be the Royal Astronomical Society right because I know where that is.

56
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,040
 I mean it basically depends if you want to hang out with Dave Lally because Dave Lally will definitely

57
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:58,240
 be there. It is Dave in the audience. No. Why is Dave Lally following you around academic lectures?

58
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,560
 Because Dave Lally is an enthusiastic member of the Royal Astronomical Society he used to

59
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,840
 organise the picnic. That is true. He was the person that basically made the society open up to

60
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,560
 effectively affiliate members because he just nagged them until they caved which is you know if

61
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,640
 you've met Dave Lally you'll understand. Right anyway yes. So Bridget has written in chat you

62
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:29,520
 could institute the Octothorpe lecture. We could. What would I get? Probably not. On the subject of

63
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,080
 the BSFA lecture clashing with the bid session do we want to talk about the upcoming Easter

64
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,720
 com of which there are there is much news listeners so for people who weren't at the bid session

65
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,960
 there were two Easter cons that were seated by the session and then there were two Easter cons

66
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,360
 that were kind of announced for future years so we started to chronologically do the beginning

67
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,600
 and then move towards the end. We should. All right Liz what do you think given you weren't there

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,880
 let's get Liz's opinion first. I mean I like having Easter cons so I enjoy having

69
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,520
 some Easter com bids. They both sound like good Easter cons. Yes so the 2026 Easter con is iridescent.

70
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,480
 Its website is easter con 2026.org the guests of one are RJ Barker, Karen Lord, Emma Newman,

71
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:26,960
 John Wilson and Serena Culfether and the philadel attending is 80 pounds the un waged is 50 and the

72
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,680
 support is 40 pounds so yes and they're sharing their sight with an anime convention

73
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,920
 which is new. We've not done that before to the best of my knowledge. So I think Phil said that

74
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,600
 they'd got about 60% of the site and the anime convention had about 40% of the site there's an

75
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,400
 enormous amount of conference space in the Hilton so I think that will probably be fine. Phil is in

76
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,720
 the audience so they've just given us a big thumbs up. I mean we're not we're not about to say oh no

77
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
 so it's going to be incredibly pokey and we'll all be on top of each other. I mean I think it will be

78
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,120
 fine and we're looking forward to obviously I was involved in the team the rather rather last

79
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,880
 Easter con on the site which was amazing obviously no pressure guys.

80
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,160
 Also I like the NEC. I was trying to explain this to someone the other day where the NEC is

81
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,600
 objectively not a beautiful place but I have so many good memories of the NEC. Every time I go I'm

82
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,040
 like oh I love the NEC and it's just you know playing games getting very drunk eating lots of

83
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:33,360
 nandos that's a good weekend. Is the is the anime con in the NEC or just in the other bits

84
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,920
 or else it's a small one okay so there might also be something in the NEC of course because I mean

85
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,280
 effectively last time we sort of shared a lot of like the hotel like spaces with people who were

86
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,080
 at the con at the NEC anyway so they're all there at breakfast and occasionally in other bits so

87
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,960
 I'd rather share it with the anime con and we shared it with a lot of coronavirus. Well we don't

88
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,520
 know like yes but I mean we can't really say directionally who brought the coronavirus to who

89
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,200
 Alison is that the one where we were worried you'd given me coronavirus and I would get stuck in

90
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,840
 quarantine for two weeks. It's the one where we all shared the IPA by drinking it from straws

91
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,320
 right next to each other's faces and then our single coat. Yes that was the one where I had to

92
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,720
 pass the COVID test the next day otherwise I would get put into like 14 day quarantine. Yes

93
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,080
 that was a good convention this would also probably be a good convention. I don't think it was I

94
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,160
 think that was reclamation. Oh no I know the other he's so one where we shared where we

95
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,640
 drank the same drink with a straw was Heathrow and the one where I was I'd already caught COVID

96
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,800
 at the time we did Dr Thought. But it's worth noting that relatively we'll always be outnumbered

97
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,360
 by coronavirus because they're really small so there are loads of them but there's only a thousand

98
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,600
 of us how many how many coronaviruses are in the given person Liz? Millions. Yeah so they outnumber us

99
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,840
 they're just gonna we need to really up our game. So my current practice is to get a private

100
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,320
 vaccination two to three weeks before EasterCon and so far that's worked this time so I do know

101
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,720
 so far that's worked this time. Oh I see what you mean it's worked that makes me a lot of sense

102
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:13,360
 I'm relatively content with this model of it's very expensive oh and it's in the sewers yeah.

103
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,920
 That was something that Liz said in her lecture for those who didn't go and are just like why did

104
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:27,760
 Alison say it's in the sewers? I'm not saying I'm not up for a convention held entirely in the sewers

105
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,600
 but I would want to do a good job on the big presentation. Have a great games room. Yes that

106
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,200
 was a joke about turtles. Shall we go back to the EasterCon? What do we think of the guests of

107
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,800
 honour? I'm excited. I haven't read any RJ Barker novels but I've met them and they're very nice.

108
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,680
 I like Karen Lord books I've read some of Emma Newman's books and they were good. I haven't read

109
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,080
 the newest one that's which is like a kind of slight departure into with more I think fantasy

110
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,000
 pirates I've read science fiction ones so that's good and yeah John and Serena like it's great let's

111
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,400
 honour fan it's nice that they both got a fan guest of honour honouring someone who does a lot of

112
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,040
 work and gets recognised for it now so yeah. I've also read I read Emma Newman had a series that was

113
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:21,040
 a finalist for best series in the Hugo Awards so I liked that. Right the discord is a

114
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,040
 distractigast. The discord is doing what it does and I feel it's a good thing we don't have a

115
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,080
 discord stream on most of our regular recording sessions. Yes. So if you're watching the audio

116
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,080
 later and can't see the discord I'm very sorry. I mean you could always join the convention

117
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,560
 in the future just to read the discord but that might not be an effective use of cash.

118
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,280
 So did anyone join this convention just so they could read the comments on Oxford Live?

119
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:59,760
 No probably not. Shall we move on? Can I talk about 2027? Yes you can talk about 2027.

120
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,160
 The 2027 Eastcon is unconfined it will be in the Crown Plaza in Glasgow where we have held at least

121
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,360
 two Eastcons. I think exactly two Eastcons before and they have both been great so I'm expecting

122
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,320
 this one to also be great. I think maybe we also held two cons there but we'll forget that.

123
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:25,680
 P.J.L.E. Clark, L.R. Lamb, Mark Meenan and Tamzin Muir is a Splendiferous Roster.

124
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,160
 Right so P.J.L.E. Clark is a fabulous choice of guests and Tamzin Muir is a fabulous choice of

125
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,960
 guests. I personally have never heard of L.R.L.E. Lamb have either of you two. I've heard of them

126
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,840
 because you know they're an author and I'm pretty sure they have written a book that is in my house.

127
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,160
 I have not yet read that book but I intend to read that book. I think there might have been,

128
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,520
 I can't remember what the name of it is though but yes I'm familiar with them as a sort of concept

129
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,920
 but I have not yet read their books but I will do in preparation for the Eastcon and I have never

130
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,760
 read any books by Mark Meenan but I understand that is not his primary. I understand he's more

131
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,000
 of a lemon curd person than a writing person. So Mark Meenan was working very hard on conventions

132
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,880
 when I got into cons in 1984 and has continued to do so continuously ever since and I was very

133
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,200
 pleased to see Serena and John's name come up and I was even more pleased to see absolutely brilliant

134
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,520
 choices of fan guests which I actually know guys is something I care a lot about because I don't read

135
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:33,200
 very many books. Somebody has said in the chat Rosanna again I've seen a lot of Americans saying

136
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,280
 they'll come just for Tamsen Muhre and once they'll just get a passport from me. No so Tamsen Muhre I

137
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,480
 think has not done any guest slots previously. I think this is the first convention she is a

138
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,120
 guest at which makes this, I don't know if everyone is aware of how I think they are, they must

139
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,640
 have worked very hard to make that happen but I think that will be, I mean Glasgow is a city where

140
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,720
 you would get a big Eastcon anyway but I think Meenan would attract a lot of people so I think

141
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,080
 that might be, I mean you might be looking back at the Ocons that had some guests that were also

142
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:14,640
 very attractive and they were sort of hitting 1200 which is why the question in the mid-session

143
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,160
 about capping was I think a good one because I, I mean I have already joined, I would recommend

144
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,160
 join early join often but yes I think that might be a well attended Eastcon.

145
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,480
 Yes there was a question in the bist session about what they would do if they filled up the

146
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,520
 cramploss because cramploss has got a good amount of comfort space but it's not absolutely enormous

147
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,640
 and they have told us that there is other conference accommodation in the near area that they might

148
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,400
 be able to use. Well there's a big room in the, not the aloft, what's the one on the other side

149
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,160
 of the river where they put the business meeting at Glasgow? The village. The village, yeah that's

150
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,680
 got a big comfort swimming pool. That's relevant. There's also the directly connected conference

151
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,480
 rooms in the SEC. Don't point out there's also the SEC, have we considered that? That's interesting

152
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,760
 but I mean I have no knowledge of whether the SEC would just let you have a tiny bit of the SEC

153
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,520
 with that gets very complicated. Yes I, I don't know and they haven't yet picked their venue liaisons

154
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,680
 so I don't know how, I don't, because I think if they don't the chairs are going to end up doing

155
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,280
 the work and I think that will be quite a lot of work even if you're working with the conference

156
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,080
 bureau. But I mean you can see from this Eastcon which for those who are not here is using the

157
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,200
 Hilton in Belfast but also part of the ICC in Belfast that they've got to have people doing kind of

158
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,160
 the access controls into the ICC in multiple points even though we don't have the whole ICC

159
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,360
 and so presumably that gets more complicated and more expensive and as soon as you start going

160
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,960
 into SEC which has like six doors or whatever and bits of it are public and bits of it are private

161
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,520
 that gets very complicated right? Just going in a hotel might be. Well also I've seen how hard

162
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,600
 the being on the committee for this convention I've seen how hard Lisa Macklin who is doing the

163
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,440
 venue job she's been working phenomenally hard and so I do think if you're going to involve a

164
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,120
 conference enter you are going to need someone whose job it is to do that wrangling so so yeah

165
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,720
 but you know I'm excited it will be good I mean Glasgow is great haggis pecora

166
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,440
 I mean an absolute belter of a starter at any Indian restaurant. Can we get before 2027

167
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:30,800
 a second Glasgow food joke? Well that's me told. Well somebody one of the things about this

168
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,400
 convention is somebody has pointed out that one of the great things about this con has been

169
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,440
 Belfast vibrant food culture. I like all food culture but yes Belfast has been very good too.

170
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,680
 Belfast full of good food most of which does indeed come with chips there has been this whole

171
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,520
 thread of I never expected this year to come with chips. I ordered a soup that came with chips the

172
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,640
 other day. I tell a lie I did have chips but I went to a burger restaurant so you know.

173
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,520
 Yeah Fran has pointed out on Discord that haggis pecora is not a joke which is true haggis pecora

174
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,240
 really exists. It's deadly serious. Sorry everyone.

175
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,680
 Yeah the other thing about having Tamsimua as a guest in 2027 means that presumably

176
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,840
 she is planning to have written and published another book by 2027. You would hope. So it might

177
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,400
 give you a guess about when like a Lecto of the Ninth is going to come out. I think if she hasn't

178
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,760
 published another book by 2027 then you may have to have some like a swear box for things you're

179
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,960
 not allowed to say at the con. I can't remember when a Lecto was originally slated for release but at

180
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,160
 the moment it is TBC so yeah we'll see. But I am looking forward to it because I presume it will

181
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,840
 make all of the rest of it make sense. I love the books. I'm fuzzy as to exactly what's happening

182
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,760
 in the books but I do love the books. So you think that the next one will make it all make sense?

183
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,920
 Oh yeah yeah it will tie everything together and everything will make perfect sense and there will

184
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,320
 be no ambiguity at all. John you missed the panel that told you what was going on in the books because

185
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,400
 that was the panel on sword lesbians. That's what the books are. Hey I'm going to get that on catch up.

186
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,920
 Yeah that was the panel on sword lesbians about that. What? It was about sword lesbians and Gideon

187
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:17,360
 is a sword lesbian right? Yeah so it came up. Yeah I understand. Yeah. Yep okay. Unless people want

188
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,080
 to argue Gideon is not a sword lesbian I can see some funny. So no okay she's got a sword so

189
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,520
 I'm given to understand that neither of those are sufficient they're both necessary but not

190
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,440
 sufficient except for when they're not necessary either. I go into a philosophical debate about

191
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,640
 this over dinner and I left more confused than I was when I started. And now I am more confused

192
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,200
 than you were when you started. Good. I was when you started. Yep. So I was also very excited when I

193
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,520
 saw the Eastercons for 2026 and 27 because they both have teams that include people who have not

194
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,080
 previously worked on Eastercons and are kind of coming along to do it and I like that because

195
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,520
 the more people wants to Eastercons the better as far as I'm concerned because I only did an

196
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,080
 Eastercon last time because no no it's a time before last because nobody else wanted to so

197
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,480
 the more Eastercons there are that somebody wants to do them the better as far as I'm concerned.

198
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:16,080
 I really liked it. Talking about new people coming into running Eastercons Alan Stroud announced that

199
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,320
 the BSFA are going to try and do a combined Eastercon Eurocon in 2028. I'm going to talk about that a

200
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,480
 little bit. Liz what do you reckon? I wasn't in the bid session so I didn't actually hear much about

201
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:34,000
 the 2028 bid but is it Alan Stroud bidding for 2028 or the BSFA as in the person by Alan Stroud?

202
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,600
 Alan was the one who talked but he said it would be a BSFA convention. He said the BSFA is going to

203
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,200
 bring forward a bid for Eastercon and Eurocon and I thought that was fascinating. I talked to somebody

204
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,400
 at the bar who I'm not going to shout out here who's like we spent decades trying to extract the

205
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,440
 Eastercon from the clutches of the BSFA and I was like no because it would only be one year it

206
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,960
 wouldn't like be a big permanent thing. I feel like I'd like to see the BSFA run raise their website

207
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,680
 came quite a lot before the bid and if they don't I think that's one of the things I'd be asking

208
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,040
 in a bid session for example yeah you know I'd like to see some evidence that the BSFA can run the BSFA

209
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:18,080
 before they try run the Eastercon. Lightly edited.

210
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:29,040
 I mean I'll keep it in but uh please direct Alison Scott at her. Alison's Alison's opinions do

211
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,480
 not necessarily reflect the opinions of her co-hosts. No I think it would be interesting so I have two

212
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,840
 worries which is firstly I do think I guess my main worry is that I've never been to an Eastercon

213
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,800
 that was also a year ago and I really like Eastercon and my main worry is that a year ago that isn't

214
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 Eastercon won't feel as much like an Eastercon and I will miss having an Eastercon.

215
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:56,640
 I mean we don't there's no way to know right but but because Chamorocon was a year ago and that

216
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,720
 felt like an Eastercon but it wasn't an Eastercon so I do appreciate it could go the other way but

217
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,440
 yeah so so year of cons very quite very quite a lot but they're very a lot less than they used to

218
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,640
 actually so Eurekos got a bit of a really solid vibe of its own that's quite different from the

219
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,160
 Eastercon vibe so that is interesting. I myself have been to I mean not one that I've been for as it

220
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:25,920
 happens. Eastercons so so I have been to an Eastercon it was also a year con and it was also my first

221
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,360
 convention it was Ccon 84 and it was amazing so it was my first convention ever and I know that

222
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,960
 there were it was in the Brighton Metro Pearl I know there were a huge number of things wrong with it

223
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,640
 but I did not notice any of them because I was having an amazing time because it was my first

224
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,520
 Eastercon ever and I did I tried to do everything I didn't quite you know I didn't give the hay lecture

225
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,840
 but you know I did despite obviously not being on the program I find myself on the program a

226
00:21:51,840 --> 00:22:00,720
 couple of times and and I like filked and I drank quite a lot and I did stayed up far too late and

227
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,280
 we were staying in a terrible terrible bed and breakfast and and I mean every it was the whole

228
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,280
 of the Cambridge the Cambridge Science Fiction Society and essentially every flat surface in this

229
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,920
 bed and breakfast had somebody sleeping on it and yeah it was it was amazing so yeah I think

230
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,120
 so I guess my other worry not worry but I think the other thing is that because Alan specifically

231
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,840
 named checked fantasy con when he was talking about running an Eastercon and obviously fantasy

232
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,880
 con also has a slightly different complexion to an Eastercon and I am that is that is three

233
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,080
 different approaches to convention running and it will be interesting to see how they blend and you

234
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,480
 know I think that could be very good but I'm also perhaps a little bit more wary than I would

235
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,040
 otherwise be if if it was coming from a group that had run Eastercons before as opposed to a

236
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,120
 different group but we will see I am so yeah those are my kind of thoughts I guess as they are

237
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,200
 but it is exciting to have kind of bid starting to rumble this far out because I can't remember

238
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,960
 the last time we had an idea of what the three year hence bid might be like as a public out in

239
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,360
 the open thing there's always gossip but like it's kind of nice to be able to talk about it out

240
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,000
 in the open and and and yeah yeah I thought it was really good that they could adapt so that we could

241
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,920
 put a good pontificate about it all the pod for yes I mean I'm I think the only era kind of been

242
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:32,320
 to is the one in Dublin in 2014 which I did enjoy but I was also basically dead so I just ate a lot

243
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,280
 of cookies um no a lot of cookies um I think there's a few things to be interesting like

244
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,240
 at the moment I don't have a vision of what a convention organized by the BSAFA is differently

245
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,800
 to a convention an Eastercon which is organized by people who happen to be part of the BSAFA

246
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,360
 be interesting if that means they can like send to more BSAFA stuff maybe get kind of a bit of a

247
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,640
 closer link more members involved in the BSAFA um if the BSAFA is a charity by then I don't

248
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,480
 know if that makes any difference to whether a kind of a charity can actually sponsor running

249
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,200
 the event and how that might make a difference to our finances and how things run and yeah I

250
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,560
 just want to know kind of okay if you're a Eurocom what are the kind of obligatory Eurocom things you

251
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,120
 have to do other than the awards and the bid session and I'm sure someone will tell me but

252
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,600
 we'll tell you at length that's it very few you can do whatever you like okay from the audience

253
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,280
 the BSAFA also as far as I can see is primarily an organization just catering for the needs of

254
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,360
 science fiction authors and people who would like to be science fiction authors and Eastercon is a

255
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,240
 fan-run convention which is primarily catering for the needs of science fiction fans and I want to

256
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,600
 see what they would have to say about that I think yeah I hope the BSAFA caters too I think I've

257
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,120
 made this argument before I comment from made it on the podcast but I think there are three kind of

258
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,160
 sort of broad things in fandom there's the people who make the stuff the people who talk about the

259
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,400
 stuff and the people who enjoy the stuff and by that I mean writers reviewers and fans and I think

260
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,200
 the BSAFA in an ideal world represents all three constituencies but obviously the exact kind of

261
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,560
 ratios is in flux as the makeup of the BSA is in flux and so I hope that any BSA convention or

262
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,800
 an Eastercon would represent all of those groups but it will be interesting to see how that the

263
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,960
 emphasis shifts but yeah I mean I'm actually quite excited about the BSAB because I think

264
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,280
 if we kind of say things like it would be good if the BSAB did all of these things then they would

265
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,680
 probably get on and do all of those things or try to do all of those things and I think it could be

266
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,320
 absolutely amazing Malcolm points out that if you had given the Hay Lecture at Ccon that would

267
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,280
 have been pretty amazing because they didn't start until about 2000. Yes that was a joke do you think

268
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,520
 I should have actually said a thing saying this is a joke before I made the joke? I mean given that

269
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,760
 the convention you talked about was when I was minus four and it started when I was 11 you might

270
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,480
 find that some of us don't understand the historical context for the joke. I was telling the joke

271
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,120
 for the audience many of whom were older than were plenty older than us would be there. Us poor

272
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,680
 co-hosts don't get to the other joke. John that was your one and only allowed mention of how young you were

273
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,800
 when the rest of us started going to East Cuns. There was a young one when I was first on the

274
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:16,000
 East Con Committee. I think not many maybe less than that. When we did not have a slide deck because

275
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,520
 slide decks had not been invented when I first bit the East Con but we did have a promotional

276
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:29,040
 videography I didn't know you went that far. There was another um there was another bid that was

277
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,200
 announced by Marcus Streets who I think had also been looking at 2028 and seemed a bit miffed.

278
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:42,560
 So and then he was like I might have to postpone then to 2029 so we will see whether he comes

279
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,400
 background to 2029 but I had heard rumours that he was planning but he actually stood up on stage

280
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,840
 and said it so so yeah he is also thinking about bidding for an East Con. Does Marcus have a site

281
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,640
 in mind? I don't know he just said he was thinking about bidding for an East Con but it's not clear

282
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,400
 to me whether the BSFA has a site in mind I can't remember if they said. He was definitely thinking

283
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,080
 about bidding for 2027 as well so he's been kind of slipping into the future. There's a song about

284
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,280
 that. Yeah at some point you've got to bid and not just be saying your bid because if the problem

285
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,640
 with someone saying they'll bid is at some point he needs to become a concrete bid or other people

286
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,960
 who might want to bid for that year don't have time to get that together so you do kind of have to

287
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,040
 at some point say you know concretely this is my year I am going for it and then we have like

288
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,080
 the two years to get something else organised if you fail to get a site. Phil is waving his hand

289
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,440
 at me. Hello Phil. Sue Dawson says in the chat that the BSFA site is indeed Birmingham. I assume

290
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,640
 the Birmingham LEC is not not any other site in Birmingham yeah yeah how nice is it to be a

291
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,600
 East Con in a city apropos of nothing where you actually walk out of the convention there's

292
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,360
 restaurants and bars everywhere and other hotels and things like that. Yes it's lovely it is lovely

293
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:04,320
 Belfast is very very nice so and I do also want to note there are rumours of a 2029 East Con which

294
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,360
 is not the Marcus Streets East Con but that is not yet public and there's also rumours of a

295
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,600
 of a 2030 East Con bid that might be sort of in the vicinity of the north so yes.

296
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:26,800
 And I was trying to argue in the bar that 20 2030 should definitely be in London to be the

297
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,440
 100th anniversary of the ill-third gathering of science fiction fans that was the beginning of

298
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,920
 organised science fiction fandom. Well I've started talking to everyone about Newcastle so

299
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:42,800
 and if you think Glasgow had a vibrant food culture you wait until you see a little delicacy called

300
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:49,840
 Greggs. So there's a Greggs very close to our hotel as it happens here in Belfast.

301
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,080
 All right are you saying Greggs is very outside Newcastle this is scandalous it will never it

302
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,040
 will never stand um but yes but yes shall we talk a little bit about Belfast Liz I understand

303
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,120
 you had a burger. I did have a burger. Good excellent. I'm trying to work out what John wants

304
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:14,000
 to know about this burger. Tell us about the burger. So after some cocktails were partaken off

305
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,800
 yesterday a few of us went in search of food and we went to one place around the corner

306
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,000
 and they were full and we said oh do you where do you recommend and they named two places so

307
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,560
 we went to one of those and they said oh we stopped serving food and we asked them okay well where do

308
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,160
 you recommend and they said how about that burger place across the street is really good so we

309
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,880
 went to the burger place across the street and it was really good. They serve burgers cheese burgers

310
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,520
 and a variety of types of chips and that is it vegetarians do not go there. Yes the menu was on a

311
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:48,640
 business card which I particularly like and we went to a place called Rattlebag for cocktail

312
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,920
 and there were cocktails and my head is sore. Oh the burger place was called Bunsen sorry people

313
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,920
 in the chat are asking Bunsen. We are somehow I think all staying in like the trendiest hotel in

314
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,560
 Belfast which has a little hidden cocktail bar and a rooftop pizza place and yeah I mean we are not

315
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:13,280
 all staying there but quite in I meant I meant the podcast not the whole room the three of us are

316
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,760
 in a room together with beds in the shape of an octothorpe we have pillow fights every night it's

317
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:28,880
 great. Have you been in my dreams again John? So I set up a group chat for the people who were staying

318
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,800
 in the in the in the hotel and and this girl was like no you can't have a group chat with

319
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,600
 more than 10 people it's got about 25 people on it so a lot of people are staying in that hotel

320
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:48,400
 it does that. So and we we also went there's just Belfast is great like so so the you know there's

321
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,880
 bread there's cocktails there's white pudding and black pudding and all sorts of things and it's

322
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,080
 all amazing. Oh and I also want to say so you know how conference centres not world renowned for

323
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,760
 their food and drink the ICC here the little bar that they've got which is firstly amazing because

324
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,640
 right next to the art show in the fan tables and round the corner from the details of dealers room

325
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,640
 there's loads of seating so it feels really good but the other thing is that that little bar

326
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,960
 has cans of like local Belfast like pale ails and also does great sausage rolls so I am pleasantly

327
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,520
 surprised by the ICC's food offering and you know the Hilton bar exists and you can play things from

328
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,560
 it. The Food and Hilton bar is not bad actually I had lunch there yesterday. So I have not been

329
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:38,240
 having lunch because I've been having breakfast in the hotel where it's like if you imagine one of

330
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,200
 the best breakfast cafes you've ever been into and then an OHS who says oh you can order anything

331
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,680
 you like if you want some extras that's fine too or some sides and then you can have as many flat

332
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,600
 whites as you can drink which is not a thing that has ever happened to be before and would you like

333
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,720
 some juice and pastries as well and so I have felt no need to have lunch on any day of this

334
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,440
 convention which is great. When we were checking in I went and I bought a croffin and a coffee and

335
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,880
 the guy was like if you're staying in the hotel it's free if you've got the breakfast package and I

336
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
 was like haven't checked in yet so I think I probably need to pay you some money but there yeah it's

337
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,880
 very very lovely and I think we locked it down. Well I think Claire Braley did an exhaustive search

338
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,520
 of all the hotels in Belfast and told us which one to book in fact which is like looking out.

339
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,920
 And one of the suggestions from the audience was to talk about our favorite cocktail so they made

340
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:32,560
 me a put I don't know how to pronounce it poi poi tin. Pushing. Pushing sour. That's actually

341
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,480
 lovely. Cheesy chips. I was gonna go I was gonna go it's not the cartoon cat.

342
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,760
 But yeah Pushing sour. That's Pushing.

343
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,400
 Lovely. Is that they sound sort of similar. They sound more similar than that poutine but yes

344
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,120
 Liz what was your favorite cocktail? I had a gimlet and it was very nice. I also had a cosmo

345
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,600
 I believe there is I mean they so they do cocktails with classic names but they're not exactly like

346
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,120
 the classic cocktails. There is a photo of me holding my cosmo while I look very excited to have been

347
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,920
 given a cocktail. Yes and there's also a photo of all our drinks where Liz looks deeply unimpressed.

348
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,800
 Yeah because I came in late and so I didn't have a drink yet. So it was just like seven drinks and

349
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,320
 is being like. But I did try all of them so. We went with Tammy Coxon and that was very fun

350
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:26,480
 because for those who don't know Tammy is a expert in cocktails and the picture of Liz has been posted

351
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,200
 into the discord chat. So Tammy does. No that's a different picture I hadn't seen that one.

352
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:41,200
 So Tammy does excellent cocktail workshops and has done them for our little online convention

353
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,200
 and she has been here and she does a podcast called Tiny Bottles and she came to me on Friday

354
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,840
 and said do you happen to know anyone who habitually drank baby sham and I asked Farrah and I believe

355
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,080
 that Farrah has tasted a historic baby sham with Tammy and I won't spoil the podcast but Farrah was

356
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:08,000
 like I used to drink baby sham all the time. I am also going to be on a forthcoming episode of

357
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,800
 Tammy's podcast and I made her drink a glitter bomb which I was very happy to be able to do.

358
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,400
 Excellent. You've got to go and question from the audience do you want to explain what that is

359
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,000
 and my answer is you've got to go and watch or listen to the podcast. I'm driving traffic

360
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,400
 but yeah it was fun. It reminded me of my youth. We will put a link to Tammy's podcast in the

361
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:38,160
 show notes. My favourite cocktail they there was a very good Negroni on the menu and later in the

362
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:44,240
 weekend because I've been drinking this bar a lot apparently. I don't my memory is not entirely

363
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:51,680
 clear but later in the weekend the chap whose bar it is was like but perhaps you would like a

364
00:34:51,680 --> 00:35:01,040
 left hand which is a Negroni except with bourbon instead of gin but actually the bourbon is

365
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,520
 cacao infused and I said that does sound fabulous and that was I think my favourite of the

366
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:16,320
 seven or eight cocktails I have added that bar. Yeah no it's um yeah in my head.

367
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,680
 So we had all other audience suggestions. What's the best punctuation mark? The Octothorpe.

368
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,080
 Yeah that's what I said. Yeah sorry. I do not have a favourite punctuation mark. Liz is well

369
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,480
 adjusted everyone Liz remains the one adjusted member of the podcast. Now everyone in the bar

370
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,400
 yesterday thought semicolon. I was going to say my actual favourite punctuation mark is indeed

371
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:47,120
 the semicolon I am sorry. I like full stops. I like I yeah now a good dash a good dash. Oh you can't

372
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,920
 mean it. And dash. John did you know that I don't know which dash should be used in which place and

373
00:35:51,920 --> 00:36:00,880
 so I just use them interchangeably. Liz I had a suspicion. I met Claire Brawley would not be happy

374
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,800
 because I have to send Claire things to proofread and Claire has like a physical punctuation mark

375
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,880
 which is like someone rolling their eyes and whenever I send Claire anything to proofread

376
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,040
 that's the reaction I get even and I know it's there even if I even if I didn't see it. So someone

377
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,360
 in the discord and entourage has written semicolon is what I want to be but dash is who I really am.

378
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:29,200
 That's very good. So entourage we had an Octothorpe meetup I should say so there are

379
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,800
 a couple people. I think everyone who came to the Octothorpe meetup. It was fun. I had fun. I

380
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,400
 hope everyone else had fun. And we met some listeners we hadn't met before which was very nice

381
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,760
 so that was good. Yeah. Two to be exact. Yeah two. Yeah. One of the results entourage was as well

382
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,600
 I thought of it. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So hello entourage. And emission was the other one. I don't know

383
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:52,400
 as emission is he? Hello. Yes. And um. Yes. No emission. Yeah. And then I Alison and Liz both

384
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,040
 asked for our thought ribbons and I refused to give them them. Yeah. Like where are your ribbons?

385
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,360
 No. No. No. No. No. No. No. John. And I was like hmm. So John continued not giving me an octothoribbon

386
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,840
 past the point where I stopped finding it funny and up to the point where I started finding it

387
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:19,280
 pretty blood irritating. Yep. This reminds me so for listeners who remember the discussion of the

388
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,840
 timing of the meetup where I pretended to think that you were talking about a 9am meetup both

389
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,040
 Alison and Liz after I did that edit of the podcast send a message in Discord saying John did you

390
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,560
 mean to take to keep the bit in where you're a dick? And I was like yes. Yes I did. Why break

391
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,720
 the habit of a lifetime? Yes. Um. All right. Stewart asked us to do some serious talking about

392
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,120
 con pricing. Yes. Well I asked a question in the bit session which was like I'm surprised by how

393
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:53,840
 low the prices are for the two upcoming East cons. I want to say they are both higher than.

394
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,920
 So the previous few East cons have started their pricing at 70 pounds. And these ones start at

395
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,440
 1885 and that is encouraging because I do think it does need to go up a bit. But yeah I still

396
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,080
 I guess I don't know. It surprises me that you can do it that low. But I mean maybe I'm just off base.

397
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,360
 I don't know and I don't know when I don't know where the rate will go up to. But we've talked

398
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,120
 about this one previous episode but yeah do I do you have any thoughts? Well these two conventions

399
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:27,280
 are both based primarily around a hotel. If you base it around a conference centre then the

400
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,160
 membership is going to have to pay for that. So that that in itself is I think this convention

401
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,920
 is managing with its conference centre. I think because it has successfully

402
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,080
 we've built a very large sum of money out of Belfast City Council. And in fact I would say one

403
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,960
 of the things about this weekend is have you noticed how the entire city of Belfast is absolutely

404
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,240
 delighted to have us here and really everywhere you go people are kind of talking about us and

405
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,920
 the convention and being really positive about it. And yeah it's really nice. So and that's one

406
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,920
 of the things that is clearly something that's a good thing for Belfast. Very excited to get

407
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,480
 get us and that's nice. Mike Scott in the Discord points out the levitation started at 95.70.

408
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,720
 Levitation is now LYA. If you look at the other three they were very very consistent price.

409
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,960
 I thought you had an early bird rate that was lower than that. I don't think I paid now to five

410
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,880
 pounds. I can't remember. I can't remember. But they might was on the committee so I guess

411
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,280
 I can't remember which one was levitation the one in Telford. Ah okay. Yes yes. But yeah would you

412
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,960
 come back to Belfast for an Easter come? Yes. Me too. Oh yes. I and also people have been kind of

413
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,880
 saying the the site is very spread out but I didn't find it very hard far. I think because the

414
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,560
 Hilton bar is bang in the middle. So you get to the ICC by walking out of the bar one way and you get

415
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,960
 to the functional space here by walking out of the bar the other way. And because if ever I want to

416
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,960
 get anywhere it needs to come I have to start by walking out of the bar. It just seemed fine.

417
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,600
 It didn't seem unreasonable at all. So I didn't think it was a strong out spite. But it's clearly

418
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,520
 if you're kind of at the far end of the Hilton functional space and you want to get to the far

419
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,400
 end of the ICC it might be quite well. It's not. I mean I said to like Meg Meg writes in the discord.

420
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,040
 Alison walked out of the bar. Okay walked is a strong word but yes.

421
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:26,000
 But yeah so so the... Wasn't the bar with the cocktails. The thing is I think this conference

422
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 space. I'm pretty sure I've been to Birmingham conventions where the rooms were further apart

423
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,640
 than they are here. Like I don't think it's that bad. Yeah there are some super distant rooms in

424
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,880
 that Hilton right. I'm not sure if we've used them in the most recent cons but there are some

425
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,080
 words like continue down the long corridor looking for the beware of the leopard sign kind of thing.

426
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,360
 When I remembered do you remember the Ocons that the Radisson Edwardian that was that was a mate?

427
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,240
 Yes because apparently I am the only person who feels that the Radisson Edwardian is a perfectly

428
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,080
 sensibly laid out hotel and doesn't get lost. Liz is well adjusted.

429
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,360
 But this is this spizz to be me versus like the entire fandom and Diana

430
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,200
 when Jones has was being discussed on on Blue Sky earlier. I mean like yeah.

431
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,640
 I think that hotel is pretty reasonably laid out too but I just pretend that I don't

432
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,160
 so I can fit in with everyone else. Please like me please. I think part of the reason is that the

433
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,760
 the hotel was totally differently configured the first time we used it from the second time we

434
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,920
 used it and that makes a big difference. Maybe. So that normally if we go back to like even if

435
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,720
 you go back after 20 or 30 years Easter got hotels and much much the same as they used to be

436
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,240
 except with slightly cleaner wallpaper sometimes but not that one because of the pool that we

437
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,880
 weren't supposed to take glasses into disappeared so we can no longer take glasses into it.

438
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,440
 Okay so in 1996 when we're not going to make a joke about how old John was we went to the

439
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,440
 Eastcon in the Radisited Waterian called Evolution. Oh and he threw. And he threw. Oh okay. Cool cool cool.

440
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,360
 Yeah and we did not take glasses into the pool which is the source of that joke. I guess there

441
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,320
 was like comfort space all around the pool in a way that was ideally suited to just like hanging

442
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,640
 out with your drink if you'd been allowed to which we weren't. Have we covered everything that we

443
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,880
 were told to talk about? I think so and it is half past which means we have the end of hour one.

444
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,520
 Yeah. When are we doing pics? Yeah. Okay but we're going to take some audience questions.

445
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,760
 Oh I wanted to call out Nicholas but it scrolled out. Nicholas told us about a punctuation mark.

446
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,240
 So would you like to tell us about the punctuation mark from a roving mic or something and then

447
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,760
 could you take the roving mic to other people Nicholas? Thank you. It's the on button for the

448
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,240
 moment. So I don't mean Nicholas. I've been reading the moderator guides the chap in the middle of

449
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,720
 the room with the pointy ears. I don't know how you turn it on. The person in the middle of the room

450
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,280
 Thank you. Sorry. The parent is on I didn't.

451
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,120
 Doesn't the moderator guide say or not supposed to comment on people's physical characteristics?

452
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:58,720
 Sorry. The person in the middle of the room cosplaying somebody with pointy ears.

453
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,640
 I think I'm cosplaying a Hugo administrator actually.

454
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,920
 But I wanted to let everybody know about the Temerote slack which is used in the Ethiopian

455
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,080
 languages Amharic, Gairs, Tigrine, maybe a couple of other ones as well. And it is used to indicate

456
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:22,320
 irony or sarcasm. You can find it on your computer because it looks exactly the same as the inverted

457
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:28,240
 exclamation mark which is used in Spanish for the start of sentences that end with exclamation marks

458
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,000
 in other languages. Although then the problem is you have to find all the other Gairs alphabet

459
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,160
 letters on your computer which will take a little bit more digging. But I think it's the single best

460
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,040
 punctuation mark I've ever come across and I wanted to make sure that everybody else heard about it.

461
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,960
 So thank you for calling me for that question. Yeah right.

462
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,680
 I do now have a favourite punctuation mark.

463
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,480
 Right so does anyone have a question? Put a hand up and we will deliver a microphone to you.

464
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,920
 There must be some questions. Come on don't be shy. Oh there's a question person there wearing

465
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:12,160
 gold. No sunglasses with grey. So this is one of the very deep important philosophical questions.

466
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,480
 Tati Skones or potato bread which do you prefer?

467
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,080
 Okay no less doss. I will have both please thank you.

468
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:25,920
 Like quite like the wheat and bread actually. Yeah the Northern Irish wheat and bread is very good.

469
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,880
 I didn't hear the question sorry can you repeat it for me? Do we like Tati Skones or potato bread?

470
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,120
 I don't know. I'm not sure I've had either actually.

471
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,760
 I've got to take Liz and get her to give her food.

472
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,320
 So yes yesterday at dinner I had a starter which was different breads from Belfast and I had the

473
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:50,160
 starter to myself and it was for 10 bits of bread and I was very happy because I love breading in

474
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,040
 Ireland it is so good. Did you start to come with chips? No I had no chips yesterday.

475
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,480
 What apart from the burgers? No I didn't have a burger. I had the burger yesterday.

476
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,600
 Yes I had potatoes. I mean admittedly I had mashed and roast potatoes but that's just you know the

477
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:13,360
 UK. Carbs on carbs with a carb for starter. This does seem to be in general quite a carb forward

478
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,160
 food culture. What Britain yes I agree. No no but first comment is "fan you made when she moved

479
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,600
 to the UK was you guys really like carbs" and I was like yes yes we do. You put a carb in the carb

480
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:29,200
 and then you have it with a carb. Oh yeah no that's like a chip butty. Yeah yeah yeah. Any other

481
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,840
 questions there was one. There's definitely Tony's got a question. He's going to ask us about chip

482
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,160
 person over there with the blue tea. Call Tony. Is it tuned to ask your suggestions for candidates

483
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:53,040
 for the next Pope? Yes but I understand Alison has never been Pope so

484
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,400
 No um as I think we've previously suggested that Dave McCarty.

485
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:09,200
 Oh right. So I'm not going to take a picture of Paddington as the Pope.

486
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:16,240
 Is there like a Conclave RPG yet? And if not so I want to do one more next year.

487
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,040
 And if there isn't well we'll do some Googling. There is a convention called Conclave but I

488
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,120
 can't remember where or why but I know that in my head so it must be true right?

489
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:31,040
 It's an American one I think. Yes yes probably statistically that's likely.

490
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:38,320
 That has all the vertical. Well I mean there's a good idea but maybe not in Belfast.

491
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:44,640
 I know I know I know I should probably wash my ears out but I heard that as Battercon.

492
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,920
 I mean Battersea Power Station. Can you hold a con there?

493
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:58,160
 Could we call the convention at Battersea Power Station convention in the station?

494
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,840
 It's a snappy name but we could workshop it slightly more.

495
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:08,000
 Bridget says can we buy memberships with papal?

496
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,840
 And Conclave was in Michigan. I knew I'd do it excellent thank you very much.

497
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,360
 Right and also so does anyone else have a question?

498
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,920
 Any you can ask anything on your mind anything you've won that includes you discord you can

499
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,240
 start with the poke puns and ask a question if you like.

500
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:32,960
 Oh there's someone over there with a lovely blue cardie over a lighter blue t-shirt.

501
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:41,040
 All right so question now what I think you've talked about about in general but

502
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,640
 of items you were on for what has been your favourite that hasn't been mentioned.

503
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,200
 Shall I start? Yes.

504
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:56,080
 Because I accidentally forgot to fill in the programme form and so I then went oh I forgot

505
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,680
 what to fill in the programme form. I should write to them and say it's a bit late but can I be

506
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,880
 on the programme and then I went or alternatively I could not do that and it's really amazing.

507
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,440
 So the only other item I was on apart from this one was the fan funz auction.

508
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,600
 So hands up everyone who's in a cocktail bar during the fan funz auction.

509
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:19,840
 Well done and but nevertheless we had yeah no you definitely I thought you were as well.

510
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,240
 I can't. Yeah no I'm okay good.

511
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,280
 Like my co but we raised a ton of money so thank you everyone who came along and bid

512
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,440
 and what's amazing is that we raised it from one suitcase full of items so that that's so much

513
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,120
 less work than normal I mean it was still quite a bit of work but thank you we raised

514
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,320
 1100 pounds for the fan funds next year we're having a massive fan funz extravaganza

515
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:50,320
 at iridescent so we will have a voice auction and a silent auction and some direct sales and

516
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,080
 something that is like amaze balls or tambola or something so if you are coming to iridescents

517
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:01,440
 bring us like just clear out your cupboards and we might throw some things away but we will also

518
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,960
 sell a lot of things for the benefit of the fan fun so thank you very much everyone.

519
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,800
 I missed the tambola so much that I was delighted to find that there was another tambola in the

520
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,120
 dealers room that I could give my pound coins to.

521
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,440
 This have you been on any other panels this weekend?

522
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,360
 I've been on one panel this weekend John.

523
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,920
 No was the other one where I was that next to you John?

524
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,600
 Do you want to talk about that one Liz?

525
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:27,760
 Yeah so we there was a panel on fandom politics and boycotts which you cannot watch because it was

526
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,720
 neither streamed nor recorded. Was that deliberate? Yes.

527
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,320
 Because we talked about like you know convention bids and mostly talking about world combids

528
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:41,120
 and specifically you know the politics around them and whether we should boycott them whether

529
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,960
 we should you know move bids in different countries what sort of standards should we have for bids?

530
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,240
 And I think it went quite well but we were maybe a little limited in that we were all people

531
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,720
 coming from a mostly you know from different European or American convention running traditions

532
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:02,000
 and when you're discussing like where you should take convention bids from it's nice to have people

533
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,760
 from other places that are considering doing that but with that limitation I think we made a good

534
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,320
 job of it. Yeah I hope so. I mean we came up with clear answers to the question which can be

535
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:20,080
 implemented easily and quickly. We did not that as a lie. We basically said it's really hard

536
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:25,520
 but we went into more detail than that. I tried to get into that program item but it was very full.

537
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:32,080
 It was full 15 minutes before it started which I is not often and I think I guess because it's not

538
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:38,080
 because it wasn't streamed actually. I think people are using the not streamed not catch up

539
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,760
 tags on Conchler and Discord quite heavily to work out what to prioritize so that probably helped a

540
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,720
 lot. Yeah so I did try to go to that so one thing for future programmers if you're not if you've got

541
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,800
 things that are not streamed and not recorded you might want to up the size of the room those

542
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,680
 things are in and swap out some of the things are streamed and recorded into because of room

543
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,320
 this size you know. We've got we've got about as many people as we always get for Octothorpe.

544
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:14,240
 We have a very steady audience. Doug says Doug says from the audience is this being recorded? It is

545
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,320
 probably. It always has two so you can either watch it on catch up when it's almost exactly the same as

546
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:28,560
 it goes out live or you can wait for the podcast and then you can compare which things have disappeared

547
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:34,080
 between the live show of the podcast. We have a question from Nicholas. I was going to give my

548
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:39,360
 answer to the previous question. I was on a panel which was history in board games and I thought

549
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:53,200
 that was very good. It had a excellent panel of Tim Kirk in more Russell Smith and Estema Count Stuart and it was I think it went really well. There was lots of very interesting chats.

550
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,400
 We kind of discussed a very wide range of games. If you're into games history or both then it

551
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:06,320
 I think is on catch up so yeah I liked that one. I went to a panel about 18th century witchcraft

552
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:15,280
 in county Antrim and it turned into a ukulele workshop. So change is the only constant.

553
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,440
 Are you going to give us a tune? My fingering is not very good Alison.

554
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,840
 Wow I'm not sure I need to know that thank you Nicholas.

555
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:31,120
 Have you considered octothor unplugged? Octothor unplugged. We

556
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:40,720
 did do octothor unplugged at Novicon because there were no microphones and we basically recorded it

557
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:46,960
 on an iPad and tried to speak very loudly. Unless you mean the sort of octothor after dark and we

558
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,080
 did that to the bar all the time. Well we just we just gossip too much when we're recording.

559
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,720
 There's too much that we cut out because we're not allowed to say it so we yeah I know it's tricky.

560
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,560
 But I'm not allowed to say it. I mean John doesn't allow us to say it. That's not true.

561
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,440
 There have been things I've said on the podcast that have been. But yes one day maybe.

562
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,400
 I still got all of the audio is still on my Synology so when I die people can go back through

563
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,000
 and like do all of the archival and stuff right. Don't get ideas. I mean I'll be dead first John

564
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,760
 because you're so much younger than I am. Yeah. Name of the episode. Right. Any other questions or

565
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,960
 should we move on to pics? I didn't know I was supposed to bring a pic. I know.

566
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,120
 We've always wanted to bring a pic. There have been some interesting comments on Discord actually

567
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,320
 pointing out that another issue with which items get streamed and which don't is you tend to have

568
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:41,120
 the streaming gear in the bigger rooms because they're going to be more popular stuff for streaming.

569
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,920
 And so that kind of affects that you know if you're then putting the on-stream things in the

570
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,240
 bigger rooms where you've set up all the streaming tech then that's an issue. So you got a balance

571
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,960
 at all. Yeah. Meg points out panelists sort of via the panelists says they don't want to be streamed.

572
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,480
 That's another consideration. It is a program is a complex and interlocking thing which is tricky.

573
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,640
 Pixar it didn't happen says "British Helpfully". I can't believe we've never made that joke in

574
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,400
 133 episodes. No it's good. I love our listeners. Okay Liz you pick first.

575
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:17,440
 Do you want a serious pic or shall I just pick a funny easter con? I will pick easter con karaoke.

576
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,440
 Not solely responsible for why I am powered by cough syrup and strep seals this morning

577
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,120
 but might be a little bit of it. Because it was that nice mix of karaoke so

578
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:32,640
 tech said it all up so that you could just scan a little QR code and queue up songs on your phone.

579
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,960
 So you can you know scroll through the catalogue at your leisure and also see how long the queue

580
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,400
 is and when you're up which is pretty good. It had a very very wide range of things and people

581
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:48,560
 sang a very very wide range of things and it was just like good nature and fun and I enjoyed the

582
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,800
 slight battlement of different cultures coming together and seeing what other people consider

583
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,360
 to be top-notch karaoke songs. Yeah no the karaoke was great that's a good pic. Alison what's your

584
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:06,560
 pic? Well I picked the halexer right at the beginning so I'd have and then we've also talked quite a

585
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:13,440
 lot about the cocktail bar that might also feel my pick and I think I might be running out of.

586
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:22,800
 That's basically what I've done at breakfast. The steak? The steak was good but I mean I don't

587
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,120
 really like picking a steakhouse because steaks are expensive and we're very very rarely steak.

588
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,920
 It's extremely unusual for us. Steaks are expensive but the halexer requires you to come to easter con

589
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:38,320
 and steaks are relatively inexpensive by comparison. Yeah if you so basically here's how it worked.

590
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:47,040
 I was like we have saved 40 quid a night per room by staying in the other hotel so as we've taken

591
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:53,200
 two rooms and it's five nights so that's 400 quid and as it happened the week a couple of days

592
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,960
 before easter con we had an incredibly expensive meal. I was like that's great because that's covered

593
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,960
 by the money we've saved on our easter con bill and then I was in the cocktail bar and I was like

594
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,640
 well you know these cocktails are pretty expensive but it's been covered by the money we saved on

595
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,680
 easter con bill and then we went to have to the steakhouse and the steak's for amazing

596
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,240
 which I was like oh it's fine because it's covered by the money we've saved on the easter con

597
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:20,000
 on the easter con hotel bill but in fact it turns out that if you count up the money we spent

598
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,080
 at the fabulous restaurant and the money we spent at the steak restaurant and the money we spent

599
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:29,680
 at the fish restaurant and the money we spent at the cocktail bar it is all taken together

600
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,800
 quite a lot more than the amount we saved on the hotel room yes but it's always the way

601
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:45,280
 my pick is going to be the last cocktail we got at the cocktail bar so we had we were with

602
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,080
 Tammy Coxon who does a podcast we went to do earlier and she when she goes for cocktail bar she wants

603
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,320
 to have every cocktail on the menu so she's like everyone must have a different cocktail and we must

604
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:01,680
 each try all of us and so we did that and there were 16 cocktails maybe 12 cocktails but there were

605
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,000
 eight of us so by the time we were ordering the second there must have been 12 cocktails because

606
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,200
 when we were ordering the second round we ordered the other four off the menu and then we wanted

607
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,240
 four that were not on the menu which they and we basically said it would surprise us and the bartender

608
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:20,320
 gave us the most world weary eye roll I have ever seen it was great and said well give me a word

609
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:27,680
 and we all gave him a word and then it was decided that we should have a cocktail for the table and

610
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:34,480
 Meg gave him the word science fiction and he located in is it Diford's guide which is a big cocktail

611
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,640
 guide he located the pan-galactic gargle blaster and he brought us a pan-galactic gargle blaster

612
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:46,400
 which had cranberries and raspy puree and was a deep purple and if you go up in the chat that is

613
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:53,680
 the drink that Liz is sipping in the photo that was posted and it was extremely delicious but he said

614
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:59,280
 if you can guess this cocktail you get to be the first to try it and Tammy said is it a pan-galactic

615
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:08,080
 gargle blaster and he said yes and then she went no but it was it was very delightful and someone

616
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,960
 in the chat has said maybe we could you give them the word octothorp and see what they made so that

617
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:19,600
 is quite tempting but yes it was it was very good and it was it was not much like a slice of lemon

618
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,480
 wrapped around a large gold brick but it was very kind of give one last shout out actually

619
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,040
 because I realized what I could have picked which is there are some puzzle boxes or there were some

620
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:36,160
 puzzle boxes outside the fan tables and they come from like a escape room place in Belfast too obviously

621
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,920
 hoping that we will stay long enough to go and do their escape rooms and then I had to inform them

622
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,120
 nope I'm leaving on Tuesday but they brought two of their 30 puzzle boxes and they are

623
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,520
 really good fun I think they're probably closed by now so you can't do them sorry but they were

624
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:55,120
 really good fun I am going to get Stephen to stand up and model his t-shirt which he won by us doing

625
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:00,560
 the puzzle boxes it is a place called prison island they have escape rooms and puzzle boxes

626
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:07,280
 and yeah it was I we did we did the first one in no time flat and we were like feeling really

627
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,960
 chuffed with ourselves and then we did the second one and we got stuck twice at once

628
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,200
 because it's quite a hard puzzle and the other time because we were very incompetent

629
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,680
 I remember because I was in the art show now I remember listening to you playing that little

630
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:28,560
 piano for what seemed like hours well that's partly because we carried on playing the piano

631
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:33,440
 for some time after we solved the puzzle as well but we did have to get a hint for the piano and then

632
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,920
 and then I they've gone now so I can say there was a puzzle where you had to pull something out of

633
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,440
 the side of the box and we had tried to pull it out of the side of the box earlier

634
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,240
 failed and consumed it and concluded it was locked but he was like no it's just it's just

635
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,560
 telling that with the we magnet you know it just so it doesn't fall out when we move it

636
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:56,320
 it just comes out so yeah wasn't very clever all right so that was picks and I think that

637
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:01,760
 probably means it's time to wrap up so is there anything we haven't covered I don't think so

638
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,600
 audience it's just a shame we didn't have any tables for people to hide under this time

639
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:12,480
 so thank you very much to cat who has been handling the tech for us and has been fantastic

640
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,440
