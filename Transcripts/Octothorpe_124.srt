1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I would totally take a sausage sandwich above a sausage roll, I think.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,080
 So there is a stall on Leicester. There's a stall on the Greyja market here in Newcastle called

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,120
 Jordi Bangers and they do a very good sausage roll but they also do a very good sausage roll.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,440
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 124th episode of OctaThorpe, a podcast for Science Fiction

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,520
 and Science Fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 5th of December 2024. I'm John Coxon.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,320
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. We are coming to you in Advent.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,560
 So you will have eaten your first five Advent chocolates today listeners and I hope it's going well.

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,600
 We've got some letters of comment listeners. We heard from June Young. In episode 110,

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,440
 I mentioned that I had an Aurora app on my phone and June asks what app I have and what app I

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,040
 recommend. She knows she lives in New Zealand and has a Samsung Android phone even if she only has

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,120
 a tiny chance of seeing Aurora she has to try. So I got in touch with my chum Craig who works

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,120
 at the University of Otago in New Zealand and he sent through a link to the University of Otago's

13
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,480
 page for Aurora Alerts in New Zealand. So June I recommend that. I will pop a link to that in the

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:36,320
 show notes and it has advice for when to go looking and like how to see Aurora and various graphs and

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,560
 it all looks very good. In general I sent June an email with a couple of links to apps but the two

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,720
 I as my colleagues about are Space Weather Live and the Glendale app and I'll put links to those in

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,280
 the show notes as well. The one I use is Aurora Alerts UK but as the name might suggest that is

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,840
 really mostly helpful if you live in the UK and so yes not as helpful for international listeners

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
 and I'll pop some iPhone recommendations in the show notes as well for all your iPhone is out there

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,440
 but yeah. Andrew Hogg says GTA 2 is not available on Netflix. I'm guessing Alice does misunderstood

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,960
 which three games are involved in the Grand Theft Auto in Grand Theft Auto the trilogy and yes you

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:28,480
 are completely correct this is true. 100% I wasn't paying close attention. For those who are wondering

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,720
 for those who are wondering Grand Theft Auto 2 is the last good one. I think I've only actually

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,240
 played Grand Theft Auto 1. In general games get worse games get worse when they go 3D. Zelda is a

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,120
 very notable exception to this rule but like 2D games they be good. Like all the 2D Zelda's quite

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,240
 a lot. I like the 2D Zelda's but Ocarina of Time might be the best game ever made and it is 3D so

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,840
 it is a compelling counter example to my point but like I always prefer the 2D Mario's to the 3D

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,120
 Mario's for instance. I just sold my copy of Ocarina of Time 3D in my giant mountain of things I'm

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,160
 selling. Liz how many d's do you like? Oh that could go the wrong way. I'm not answering that one John.

30
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:24,080
 As many as is necessary. Wow wow correct answer. I mean technically you could say

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,240
 braid is like a 4D platform all right and I like braid so there you go. Yes braid is good. I would

32
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,960
 say braid is 3D but the third d isn't what you think. 3D? Hmm yeah I guess it is yeah. Braid is 3D

33
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:44,400
 platformer. I don't think anyone's done braid 3D but actually 4D. Oh no there is a very weird golf

34
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,320
 game. 4D golf. Have you seen any of the videos of 4D golf? Nope. Absolutely like my brain little brain

35
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,080
 just cannot comprehend 4D golf. Brilliant. Okay I apparently I need to go and play 4D golf.

36
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,000
 I mean I think you need to watch a video of 4D golf and then decide if you think your brain can

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,640
 cope with the fourth dimension of the golf. It's 30% off right now Alison and it's available on your

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,560
 Mac. I'll look at the video. It looks it looks pretty mad. Mmm. Preef pause whatever you want to

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,440
 the video of 4D golf. We also heard from Chris Garcia. I think we're here from Chris Garcia twice

40
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,120
 since we lasted any letters of comment so that is a lot of Chris Garcia. Chris talks about the

41
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,280
 costs of comms for attendees. He says basically they're too high which yeah and the problem is that

42
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,480
 higher prices on a traveling comm can mean that the locals who might only be able to go to that

43
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,920
 warm comm still can't make it so even if they don't have to take into account hotel prices sometimes

44
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,920
 high prices can price the locals out. Yeah he says in the 1990s some cons tried a thing we'd have

45
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,840
 a rate for people staying in the hotel it was lower than people not staying in the hotel which

46
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,560
 does sound just very complicated basically and he's very much looking forward to an

47
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,760
 Edmonton WorldCom. I didn't quite understand the thing about people in the hotel paying less.

48
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,200
 That didn't quite make sense to me. I do think having a local person's rate which is slightly

49
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,760
 cheaper is very good idea and that's kind of what Belfast are doing right and it's something Glasgow

50
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,560
 did as well so I have no I think that's a good point to well-made Chris to that sort of thing

51
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,200
 might be good. I think the idea is if you are a con where you have to fill your room block in order

52
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,840
 to not get in trouble with the hotel then giving people a slight discount and encouraging them to

53
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,000
 fill the hotel room block could be a good thing but it just sounds very complicated to keep track

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,080
 off and as Chris says could be kind of subverted by booking and then cancelling hotels. Yeah in

55
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,560
 general I do like it when cons are sort of unbundled from a hotel because then it does give you the

56
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
 freedom to stay in whatever hotel you like without worrying that you are going to cause the cons

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,120
 financial difficulties. Yeah I know what you mean do you want to do Chris's other letter Liz or do

58
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,840
 you want me to do that? Well shall I do Tommy and then you could do Chris too. Chris to electric

59
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,320
 Boogaloo. I might do Chris's now because the other Chris one is the one that comes before the Chris

60
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,440
 one that Liz just did. Okay so you can do we also heard from Chris Garcia. Oh this is 4D letters of

61
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,520
 comment. Yeah I'm going to keep all this in obviously but the fourth dimension is time I feel like

62
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 podcasts may only be 1D there so it's 2D if you've got timey it's timey wiry stuff in it. So Chris

63
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,880
 does note that they did listen to the grass episode on the way to wrestling and JP said this sounds

64
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,360
 like a weird book. Yes JP that is not an unfair you might have gotten to the hearts of the situation

65
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,360
 there fair enough. He mentions Ekpeki and sort of talks about that we should just note there is a

66
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
 file service every article in which it turns out that the initial child that was levied against

67
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,680
 Ekpeki might not be true because Kens' name does appear on the story that Ekpeki submitted so we're

68
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,800
 we'll link to that in the show notes but that whole thing is rapidly getting into

69
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,000
 it's all just very strange now and then Chris says everything feeds into smothcon smothconning

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,160
 with virtual hybrid concept and then he says for a group that often complains that people see them

71
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,320
 as a shadowy group who doesn't want to have that action seen they sure make choices that make that

72
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,760
 impression easy to justify is not not a bad point. So yes thank you very much Chris we now return to

73
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,840
 the period of time after the time that Chris wrote to us after the one I just read. So Tommy Ferguson

74
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,280
 wrote to us as said made three points as reconnect treasurer I am very I am very confused by the

75
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,640
 concept of a combined treasurer and co-chair of an east cod that seems like quite a lot of work to me

76
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,200
 but there we go. Saying we are not in financial trouble which I think is what I said last time

77
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,320
 they have 622 members are certain they will be able to pay their bills there may be some limits

78
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,880
 on what they can and cannot do e.g. streaming and they may not have as much past as long as they

79
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:57,520
 would like and so he's passed that on to the next east cod to know. On membership prices they

80
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,320
 want as many members as early as possible which is why they went for an early rate and they knew

81
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,880
 that they were getting a subvention of £50 a person approximately for every member outside

82
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,640
 Northern Ireland from the Belfast local government tourist subsidy. So that actually totally explains

83
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:24,480
 it because if you if what you're paying is £70 plus £50 that's 120 isn't it so yeah and and he said

84
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:31,680
 without that money they could not have considered putting on the con but then he also says we anticipate

85
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,400
 a small or no virtual component reconnect get it and I would like to take issue with you there Tommy

86
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,920
 because what you do when you say we want to reconnect in person because reconnecting in person is

87
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,640
 better than virtual conventions is this is an exclusionary policy virtual conventions aren't

88
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,880
 I don't think there's anybody who goes oh I'd rather attend a convention virtually than travel

89
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,360
 people are too frail to travel or they do not have enough money to travel to a convention in person

90
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,520
 or they still feel that they're actually not safe to travel because of being immunocompromised or

91
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,760
 for other reasons and all of those things are access issues and having a virtual component to

92
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,800
 your convention and having it be as broad as you could possibly manage and I understand that finance

93
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 might constrain it isn't it's not about saying oh it's better to meet a person it's about saying

94
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,440
 oh well but we want to encourage as many people as possible to come to our convention even if the

95
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,040
 way that they do that is virtually you know as it happens liz in Thailand is flying next year but

96
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,960
 many of the people in the East Kong community who are scattered around the world cannot possibly

97
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,160
 afford to come to Belfast and his third point is this he's got a finance subcommittee which

98
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,480
 includes several people who have worked on previous Easter cons he's also getting advice and help

99
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,840
 from other East Kong treasurers and so they're kind of little little net of East Kong treasurers

100
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,640
 keeping informed and trying to make sure that the money um that that we are actually making

101
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,400
 the kind of year on year decisions about the money which I think is is very sensible and he's

102
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,880
 shared all of their income and budgets he's kind of like well it's transparent and if anyone really

103
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:22,320
 wants to see the um budget and expenditure lines do get in touch so you know if that's you listeners

104
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,920
 I mean I'm I'm pretty confident that they're doing the right sort of thing and I'll let them

105
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,120
 get on with it but if that's you then um get in touch I am going to be fascinated to know so if

106
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,880
 this convention's real cost to be profitable is 120 pounds a member which it sounds like it is

107
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,080
 I don't envy Phil and the 2026 bid which we'll discuss later I don't envy them in their decision

108
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,920
 making about where they start their prices given that reconnects started at 70 I that's going to

109
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,280
 be there's going to be gasps in the room again but again every convention makes the decisions it makes

110
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:02,000
 that are right for it and reconnect clearly feel that that is what they have done and I can't as we

111
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,040
 went over last time we can't criticize an individual convention for making the decisions that are

112
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,800
 right for them right so yeah it's hard I gotta say 50 quid is pretty good to mention from the

113
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,840
 Belfast stories board I mean I'm trying to remember how much kind of what was the kind of range of

114
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,320
 stuff Glasgow was getting for bringing a whole world con to Scotland and I think it was probably

115
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,200
 not out the realm of like what will come what Easter gone is going to get for coming to Belfast I

116
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,960
 mean they have succeeded in that I am having made the decision to go to the Belfast Eastacom I will

117
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,920
 also then like spend some more time in Northern Ireland and spend more of my tourist monies and

118
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,360
 you know fly I mean although actually I will fly to Dublin which probably was not their intention but

119
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,040
 it's working 50 quid is is buttons compared to the amount of money I'm going to spend in the hotels

120
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,920
 restaurants and bars of Belfast that weekend and also I think that we're probably not as influential

121
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,200
 as we used to be but I think that there are still plenty of influential people in in East

122
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,520
 conf anthem who are going around saying oh Belfast is actually a great place to go for a weekend and

123
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,960
 that's really important as part of the part of the discussion when tourist boards are making these

124
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,200
 sorts of choices so somebody who shall be nameless um sidled up to me in the nivcon bar and said

125
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,680
 smofcon's decision to scrap its virtual program is particularly vexing because the reason they won

126
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:37,120
 the bid over Suicon was that they promised virtual and Suicon couldn't oh I thought that's interesting

127
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,680
 that is proper gossip yeah that that is I had I confess I had not realized that the smofcon

128
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,080
 right I saw of assume that most convention bid processes are not actually contested because in

129
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,720
 general listeners they tend not to be I mean world cons is an exception obviously but like

130
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,880
 east con is technically a competitive bidding process but hasn't been for many years but I

131
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,040
 didn't as a result I hadn't occurred to me that part of the um problem here might be that Seattle

132
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,480
 had promised something in the bidding that they are then going back on and that is an interesting

133
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,480
 consideration that we didn't pick up last episode indeed and and when I say contested bidding I mean

134
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,400
 obviously this I said Suicon earlier but it is just Sweden rather than Suicon it's smofcon 42

135
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,560
 um I think it's just switched so they will do it this year so next year so it's not that

136
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,080
 it's not that that will never happen I guess it's also that if you say you're going to do

137
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,200
 hybrid and people vote for you on the ground that you're going to do hybrid but then none of them

138
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,400
 actually join as virtual members then that's also tricky yeah true also didn't we have quite

139
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:52,720
 contested east con bidding in um 20 21 but I think that's one time in the nearly 20 years I've been

140
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,440
 going so I feel like it's fair to say it's not common yes I'm not saying it's literally impossible

141
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,640
 I think we worked out there's been there's been four contested east comptons and I was part of

142
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,760
 all four of them so oops I'm also gonna so I'm also gonna say um we don't have many comments from

143
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,120
 them but we have picked up a very large number of followers on blue sky which is obviously the

144
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,080
 new hotness as far as social media goes partly because we are in some starter packs which is

145
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:27,840
 I think on blue sky where if you would like to um mass follow basically a bunch of interesting

146
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,760
 people who are related in some particular way then you can say go and find a starter pack of

147
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,920
 science fictional podcasters and click follow and you'll get to follow all of them and sort of

148
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,960
 populate your feed with people which is I think a really nice thing actually because my main

149
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,320
 problem with blue sky in the early days is it was very slow because I wasn't following tons of

150
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,360
 people because there weren't tons of people I wanted to follow and now it has massively perked up

151
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,400
 and so completely replaced twitter for me and I think part of it might be the following

152
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,480
 being a follow start back not what I have followed any starter packs but I like to use them as a way

153
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,880
 to go so go through and find interesting people I might like to follow even if I don't tend to

154
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,680
 mass follow all of them because in case they might be super prolific yeah so we're on blue sky

155
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,000
 we are octa-thorpe cast as usual um come and say hi leave us comments we might read them out um I

156
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,880
 promise to get a slightly better corrupt version of our icon that fits nicely in a circle before

157
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,080
 next episode and we have also and I don't know if we mentioned this on the podcast we are also now

158
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,360
 on instagram so if you want to follow us on instagram we are octa-thorpe sf because meta are

159
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,320
 shit but we are on instagram so if you're on there come and give us a follow we posted a show art

160
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:49,200
 cunning um we should do we also on um mastodon we got a letter of comment from archipelacon 2

161
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,080
 who says uh we appreciate the kind words about archipelacon 1 and we look forward to seeing

162
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:00,240
 alison archipelacon 2 thanks archipelacon 2 monkey king says that they are envious of

163
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,960
 alison going to archipelacon 2 because they went to the first one and they loved both the con and

164
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,560
 mariham so yeah I've heard this from quite a lot of people actually so people saying oh

165
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,280
 I don't think I can go but I loved the first one and people saying oh I'm really trying to get

166
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,880
 it together to go and then it's attracting a really interesting international crowd so that

167
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,640
 that's kind of cool it's very dangerous for alison though i will predict because it's i think

168
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,320
 it's very dangerous for you because my problem was I would be sitting in the bar having a nice beer

169
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,440
 awesome long drink and then realized that it was maybe 1 a.m because it just hadn't gone dark

170
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,040
 and so it had not triggered my oh maybe it is time to stop drinking and go to sleep so okay so

171
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,720
 fortunately I do not have um a flag that says maybe it's time to stop drinking and go to sleep

172
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,320
 the i mean essentially it happens for me when I fall asleep in my beer which means that which

173
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,320
 means that when the cues that should trigger that flag go away it will be even worse is my

174
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:10,160
 prediction you won't sleep for five days hoorah things only a three day come or four day maybe

175
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,480
 and that really illustrates how bad it is that alison won't sleep for five days Liz

176
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,800
 and then you can go and dance with the moomins on the ferry hey oh i don't think i'm gonna be on a

177
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,720
 ferry i think well i don't know we haven't done our travel yet i think i've put that in a problem for

178
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:34,400
 2025 first time writer on facebook um Sheila R says Glasgow was their first wokan first convention

179
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,280
 of any sort and they cannot get over the value of money of the weekend ticket people pay more

180
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,360
 than that for one night to giggle the theater wokan gives five days of back-to-back entertainment

181
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,840
 i think that we all know that this is why we do this this is why we go to these conventions

182
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,480
 this is what they are like come to easter cod did i say that sorry i want to pick up on this which

183
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,360
 is um yeah and i think one thing we might not have made enough of in the last few months of discussing

184
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,280
 the cost of conventions is that it is very expensive to go to conventions but they are like pound for

185
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,040
 pound some of the best value entertainment you can possibly have like and we i do think we

186
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,080
 discussed the price a lot and that's probably good and wise and price is obviously a barrier and

187
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,480
 being able to afford that price is a privilege but also it is terrific value if you can afford to go

188
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,560
 like far superior to many other forms of entertainment will might pay to attend and Glasgow is especially

189
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:36,480
 Glasgow was very very good it was this is why i am firmly on the it is okay for easter cod to

190
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,120
 increase its membership rates side of the force and then Johnny badly said best pre-credits ever

191
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:50,080
 thank you Johnny my slightly damp electronic equipment thanks you it's all dry now yeah

192
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,760
 clearly you should pour coffee into your laptop um more often nope i thought it was tea was it not

193
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,920
 tea uh no um this said it was tea but it was obviously coffee it's really it's really tea

194
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,840
 round here coffee in coffee drinking hours it's often it's often like chamomile or fennel or

195
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,760
 the kursti like at ten o'clock at night before anyone writes in we appreciate those things are

196
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,280
 technically infusions and are not technically tea just to head off that lock ahead of time

197
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,320
 that's fair because i get very grumpy when people say that soil liquidized soil or liquidized

198
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,040
 almond or liquidized oats are somehow milk so you know i was not i was not going to make any

199
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,440
 suggestion that if you were listening to this pod if you were listening to a podcast and they

200
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,520
 had said that you would be the one writing in but i am not not saying that either um but yes

201
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,760
 thank you very much to Johnny big oat milk sorry i was saying big oat milk i am quite happy to call

202
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,400
 it milk if you would like to you know send me your oat milk so i will call it oat milk on the

203
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,400
 podcast as often as possible hi alla fair oh and i will get annoyed every single time hmm

204
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,800
 which is great advertising for the oat milk lobby Johnny also wrote in to say that there's an

205
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,240
 article about me in the latest issue of mostly harmless uh and i did not know this and if anyone

206
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,520
 is listening that has a pdf please could they send it to me because i would like to know what it

207
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:20,000
 says thank you please send it to the podcast because i also want to know what it says and also i'm mortified

208
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,720
 normally when you're writing articles about people you check with the subject to see if it's

209
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,920
 got they've got everything correct it's got much that is inaccurate or at least wildly apocryphal

210
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,320
 or is that alley baker books writes in about um about traveling as an academic

211
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,840
 the long and the straw here is yes i am very lucky alley if it makes you feel better i went all

212
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,240
 the way to the u.s for a conference and then got flew so it was not quite as glamorous as it seemed

213
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,400
 because then i spent 25 hours on plane with a very congested nose but well done to my conference

214
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,120
 which did give us all a combined flu and covid test on day one all that's partly because i think

215
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,240
 they were sponsored by a flu and covid test diagnostic test manufacturer yeah that that'll

216
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,320
 that'll help or two yeah but it worked got a little length of flu yeah easter con should also look

217
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:17,600
 at getting that sponsorship mmm yeah i mean might not be quite as likely like to make i don't know

218
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,600
 yeah so we heard from the chairs of the last two easter cons in addition to the chair of next year's

219
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,160
 easter con we have been very chaired um this month so we heard from caroline mullen and fara Mendelssohn

220
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,640
 far enough that they think we should move away from a model that there is such thing as too much

221
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,280
 surplus because um it's good to have surplus for easter cons and i have to say i think i agree with

222
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,680
 that and then uh far it also notes that the budget that levitation did for their membership curve

223
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,640
 assumed the same curve as the last time there was a Glasgow world con and then the membership

224
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,240
 stalled after christmas in a way that is very unusual for easter cons um and they also had problems

225
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,520
 with their tech budget so those are considerations in what happened there um caroline rights to say

226
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,280
 that conversation did in fact um budget to have a large event but they couldn't land a booking because

227
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,200
 in 2022 the touring scene was struggling when they were trying to do so and so they ended up putting

228
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,360
 that unspent money into the pass along for future conventions and so thank you very much to both

229
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,560
 of those chairs for writing in we also heard from leavin on facebook who says back to our futures

230
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,480
 was great so well done you two hey i think that the biggest compliment i can pay it is that it's

231
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,680
 made me seriously consider virtual attendance at a world con so that is uh a pretty awesome bit of

232
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,840
 feedback to get basically you are converting people to virtual cons so yeah oh and then rosanna

233
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,240
 pendleberry wrote in to say um she went to clasco as her first world con as now going to her first

234
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,680
 easter con because she really rather enjoyed that whole con thing i'm hoping to get another fix and

235
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:06,800
 this is this is the way join us and it anecdotally i haven't heard from andy open sure but i know this

236
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,000
 to also be true of andy where we were like you should come to a convention they came to a convention

237
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,120
 she's like where is the next convention and we're like it's coming it's coming we promise i have had

238
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,600
 several conversations with people who are coming to belfast having been at world con and this is good

239
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,920
 and i understand that we probably dragged morian if the next convention was in london but you know

240
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,240
 the next year is at the lec and that's pretty easy so we if you're going oh i'd really want to do

241
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,280
 another one but i cannot get to belfast then then it's probably going to be the nac in 2026 and i

242
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,360
 getting ahead of myself because i think that's our next topic segwaying from what rosanna says i

243
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,520
 think this is part of the legacy that glasco will leave which is reinvigorating and bringing people

244
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,240
 into uh fandom in the uk um and that's really good and obviously part of the way they're doing that

245
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:56,640
 is by dispersing some of their surplus funds to other conventions so i believe it is known that

246
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,280
 glasco has distributed some of their surplus to the next three easter cons or will distribute it to

247
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,400
 the next three easter con has made it is what i was told at nova con and i was not told it was secret

248
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,800
 um was that glasco had decided that to donate five thousand pounds to each of the next three

249
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:21,600
 easter cons to help in some ways recover the surplus the the puzzle of funds that we lost over

250
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,600
 over the pandemic and if that was secret you're gonna have to start telling us everything that is

251
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,040
 whether everything is a secret when you're at the bar no i mean i don't i don't think

252
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,520
 i don't think there was any suggestion it was it was a secret so if it was i'm very sorry i

253
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,960
 seem glasco would have done this even if there had not been a pandemic because i think one of the

254
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,200
 ways in which british world cons help british fandom is that they put money into british conventions

255
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,200
 but loncon three did not um give money to the easter cons subsequent to it because it did not

256
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,400
 make a surplus um but this is something i think most british world cons that do make a surplus do

257
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,120
 is they help out the easter cons and other ventures in the country going forward and i'm sure that

258
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,440
 there is a team of elves beavering away behind the scenes at glasco working out how they want to give

259
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,880
 the money um that they've made to british fandom and cement the glasco legacy

260
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:27,600
 um i want to introduce the easter con better if that's okay because i want to say i went to

261
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,280
 nova con all right yeah i went to nova con and my normal practice in nova con is to spend the

262
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,640
 entire weekend in bars um and a variety as well as the nova con bar also all the lovely bars in

263
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,640
 buxin which is a place with a lot of very nice drinking holes but i sacrificed some of my drinking

264
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,440
 time so that i could go to the future easter cons presentation at which i discovered some useful

265
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:57,120
 things um first that phil dyson will be bidding um for the easter con at bell first and he's going to

266
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,720
 be bidding for 26 with a bid called iridescence to be held in the hilton at the nes which of course

267
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,920
 we went to in 2023 and has many virtues none of which are its immediate environment they've got a

268
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,880
 deal it's going to be they can do it i'm very much looking forward to going back for a convention

269
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,600
 that i am not on the commissive for so do you guys have anything to say about 26 or should i move

270
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:28,560
 on to 27 26 sounds good i will probably go i'm quite happy to go back to Birmingham i quite like

271
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,560
 as a venue and it seems like it is relatively easy travel wise and there are alternative hotels

272
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,720
 in the vicinity it is just a bit of a slow to get to anything but it's a lot better now they've

273
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,120
 built that um what's it called train airport hotel no that big shopping center thing with loads

274
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,840
 of restaurants in oh yeah the shopping center made a big difference yeah yeah the first time i went

275
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,880
 to an east con i know i'm going to sound really old here was back on 87 and it was absolutely in

276
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,800
 the middle of a wasteland we were told there were plenty of food and drink spots at the nes but they

277
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,760
 were all closed resort world that's his name it's good it has a nambo's and the five guys i mean i

278
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,200
 wouldn't go there as like a holiday in resort would you but i mean it's got shops and stuff no but

279
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,760
 for a convention it's great i really like five guys i know i shouldn't but there's something about

280
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,040
 that sort of burger that's just like oh this is what fast food should be like five guys are

281
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,880
 immense i will hear nothing against them i had one on friday yeah no 2026 sounds good

282
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,240
 allen flummying and david bamford announced that they are going to bid for Glasgow for 2027 and

283
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,960
 mark meanen in the bar was like i'm definitely going to find them a site they have they're looking

284
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,760
 up for hotels they are very confident they have a site you know that that one of those four will

285
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,760
 will deliver what they need and mark is helping them get the negotiation landed and i'm quite

286
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,480
 excited about going back to Glasgow for the east con because it has been a while um the last one

287
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,560
 was satellite for mm-hmm it was i have heard some rumors about 2028 i have heard a couple of different

288
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:05,520
 names in the frame for 2028 and i've also heard a site in the frame for 2828 which is the sage

289
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:12,240
 gates head um and i guess it's going to get it because the old sage has got a new name gloss

290
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,120
 house and then there's the new sage where phil dices said yeah they really wanted just to come

291
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,520
 there for 2026 and they haven't actually broken ground yet so that's a really bad idea so hopefully

292
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,000
 it'll get built at some point and then and then we might have a look at that so i'd quite like to go

293
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,480
 to gate said because i i kind of like new castle and gate said is kind of easy to get to and yeah

294
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,800
 it would be good i will say it would be interesting for um comrunners to look at new castle gates head

295
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,920
 without coming to talk to the new castle first there's a group and having a chat with us um so

296
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,080
 like you know if you are looking at these venues and you haven't come and said hello i would i would

297
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,600
 recommend coming to say hello uh there's a facebook group and a mailing list novicon was a great

298
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,320
 success and i really had a good time and they have announced that next year they will be back in the

299
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,640
 buxdon palace which is a hotel i really like indeed because i very much do because i really

300
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,520
 like being in a city center and although buxdon is not very big it has the things i want in a city

301
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,640
 center which is a lot of nice restaurants and bars and it's you've got beautiful scenery as well so

302
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,240
 you feel like you're in the fresh air in a nice place um as long as you leave the hotel um and their

303
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,360
 guest of honor next year is emily tesh which i think is a great shout i think a lot of people thought

304
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,360
 it was a great shout and their head of program next year is estan bakalam stewart and i was like

305
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,280
 oh i suppose you are in the middle and so aren't you it will be interesting to see how esta balances

306
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,840
 program from overcon and being the deputy administrator for the hugos at seattle and still being the

307
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,840
 chair of a world con that's dispersing funds and running comrunner all in a year that that is an

308
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,680
 adventurous schedulista i wish you the very best of luck i i think she'd say it's not going to be

309
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:04,400
 anything like as um hard as running the ct d's to con i worked on the east con seated world con

310
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,640
 with somebody who had just come off a world con and they've been on a world con committee and i was

311
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,760
 like i assure you you want to be doing the east con so soon he was like oh it's like a rest cure and

312
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,240
 i think that was steve coopers view on running the east con after being a world con chair was that it

313
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,480
 was it was just like falling off a log compared to the difficulty of running a world con which i

314
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,520
 can easily believe um but yes emo esta who is a busy woman is also going to be running um conrunner

315
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,240
 in 2026 february 2026 conrunner is the kind of british equivalent of smoth con british european

316
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,680
 i think she would probably say but it's all it's been britainal ways and i'm sure it will be this

317
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,440
 time as well um and conners are great fun and if you have any interest in conrunning at all or indeed

318
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,400
 if you like to hang out in a bar with conrunners then i would strongly recommend conrunner great con

319
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,880
 do we know where it's going to be uh no somewhere i mean i was like the palace hotel buxton looks

320
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,640
 like exactly the right size for what you're trying to do what did they have the last one

321
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,800
 i'm sure i went to the last one but i've now completely forgotten where it was but it was

322
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,240
 somewhere quite nice i thought it was in that awful hotel in stevenage correct me if i'm wrong

323
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,880
 might have been wrong about that maybe or maybe i really did have a good time in stevenage

324
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,600
 well i was probably under like some kind of conrunning delusion or something it was 2027 so

325
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,560
 it's been a was it's supposed to be in a conrunner i'm reading a magnificent um round up from an

326
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,360
 extremely thorough roundup from mochine which does not appear to say where it was

327
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,200
 ah if you remember where conrunner was please write inlessness oh nothing um

328
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,320
 notting them nothing at the park i would actually go to my team and get probably at the park yes

329
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,320
 that sounds more like it so basically yes hold it at the nouvere con venue esta that's the tradition

330
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,440
 please i mean if i was going to vote i would vote against that please no oh it's improved

331
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,400
 actually they keep they're refurbishing it it's getting better it's better i probably will go to

332
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,320
 nova con because emily tesh sounds good i don't go to every nova con but i go to nova cons if i'm

333
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,280
 not going to a world con and if the program sounds great and if the guests of honor sounds

334
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,320
 particularly my kind of thing and i think the next nova con fulfills some or all of those

335
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,240
 briefs so i think i probably want to go to that two different people came up to me and over con

336
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,680
 and said oh i want to run a little online con on a very niche topic john put something in the

337
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,760
 show notes that i hadn't otherwise seen and was quite interested in so well done john hey

338
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:40,320
 he has put in a note that wiskon 2025 is going to be online and wiskon is the um feminist

339
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,840
 sf convention that has been running every year in wisconsin for many years and i think this is

340
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,160
 their second consecutive year when they've basically gone online i think last year was a

341
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,640
 planned we're going to go online and do it virtually to let everyone kind of recover a bit and then

342
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,120
 2025 appears to be a we are doing it online because we don't have the volunteers to run an offline

343
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,200
 con i'm going to be very interested to see if this kind of regenerates it for future years or if this

344
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,720
 is sort of the the end of wiskons which would be a little bit a little bit strange they've been

345
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,040
 running for a long time they've been running in the same venue i went quite a few years ago but

346
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,600
 it was like a thousand person con but i guess if you don't have the people who are willing to

347
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,640
 be involved in running it you know the people don't have the the time or the energy to do that then

348
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,880
 yeah you have to try going online and then if you can't get people then you fold i guess i just sort

349
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,200
 of always thought of it as a kind of fixture of the concert even though i didn't go so yeah but it's

350
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,400
 an interesting contrast to i was saying here is the 2026 easter gone beers in 2027 and here in the

351
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,560
 room is for 2028 um it fortunately does not appear easter gone by going that way uh we've just had a

352
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,160
 local world con which as we know bob as long as it doesn't burn everybody out is extremely good for

353
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,880
 generating enthusiasm among the community for more of this sort of i think if it hadn't been for

354
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,360
 Glasgow 2024 we would in fact be we i mean we would still be managing to make use to cons happen but

355
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,200
 we might be having some of the conversations about shrinking them changing their focus that sort of

356
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,960
 thing that other places have done when it's become hard to get volunteers but we have lots of young

357
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,640
 people it's very good Glasgow had lots of young people at it that was also very good and by young

358
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:23,520
 i mean under 50 where yes so what we i guess need is a wiskonsin world con aisles to

359
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,240
 bump up those volunteer numbers in wisconsin i know or minneapolis yeah in minnesota you know

360
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,880
 some midwestern world con is what they need a wimpy zone will con i'd fucking love a minneapolis

361
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,240
 world con and i'd quite like it to happen before 2073 and for listeners who don't understand why i

362
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,680
 say that there is an extant world con bid for minneapolis in 2073 which has been going since

363
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:52,720
 minneapolis did not win in 1973 and that joke gets less funny with every passing year presumably

364
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,480
 as uh 2073 gets ever closer oh they they've been serious for a few years now they are planning

365
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,760
 to run it in 2073 and they're not planning to run it before that but you know you could do it in

366
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,200
 like 2033 or something that'd be good but yeah wiskons do specifically say like they don't have

367
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,880
 enough volunteers to run in person so lizz is like um thing about they just yeah i hope that they

368
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,040
 continue but they need the people i mean you think with minneapolis is they already have a world

369
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,840
 con sized convention which happens annually in minneapolis so yeah why would you have a world con

370
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,680
 i don't think they do anymore do they minicon shrunk a lot not minicon convergence what

371
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,560
 oh convergence yeah no no well convert why does convergence not generate people who would like to

372
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,640
 run a wiskon i don't know because they run in convergence one of the one of the things that world

373
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,240
 con does is it recruits a lot of people and then it goes away again oh yes that's true if you if you

374
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,880
 if you if you had done glasco in the next year you were doing the same thing in glasco again all

375
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,400
 the people who had just worked on glasco would be working on the next glasco they wouldn't be going

376
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,080
 into the community working on other stuff because they'd be busy so yeah non-traveling conventions do

377
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,280
 less to invigorate local fandom uh in the sense that they probably invigorate a lot of local

378
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,440
 fandom but then they invigorate it in a very specific direction i don't know historically how

379
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,000
 much of the wiskon convention committee was actually local um to Wisconsin and how many

380
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,720
 were people who came every year because this was kind of the big feminist f-compention well i might

381
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,880
 just say emminton has a website now we're not going to talk about it in much detail but we will link

382
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,360
 in the show notes or we will probably talk about it on future episodes almost certainly that includes

383
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,280
 a list of the people who are working on emminton which is quite nice to have it's my favorite thing

384
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,920
 about bid websites i know some of these people unlike them i do not know most of the people that's

385
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,680
 probably fine at this stage and she knows some of them and dislikes them but we're not going to tell

386
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:46,320
 you which we have a little real world thing this week which is kind of a psa which is that loyds

387
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,120
 are introducing monthly charges of four pounds twenty five on community bank accounts many

388
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,080
 fannish bank accounts have this and i think if you've got an active one you probably already know

389
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,600
 this and you're probably already thinking about what you might do about it the charge of four

390
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,680
 pounds twenty five is not very much compared to kind of the cost of putting on an easter con say

391
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,120
 um the people it really matters for is if you're sitting with a small bank account that's got some

392
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,880
 funds from a thing you did ten years ago or even longer then these charges will eat that all up

393
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,080
 so you should probably go and have a look and change your bank account or close it if you don't

394
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:27,440
 need it um yeah it's a bit it's a bit of pain yeah wonderful person of our parish claire brawley

395
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,320
 has done quite a lot of work on looking at all of the alternatives so if if somebody's like out there

396
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,680
 going i don't know what i might do about this then get in touch and we'll put you in touch with claire

397
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,840
 indeed we will um she won't like that or i will maybe pass on some of the information that claire

398
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,520
 has found but it is a bit of a pain

399
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:56,480
 shall we do picks so i have a pick that is a steam game that is technically an early access

400
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,400
 but we'll have its 1.0 release the day this podcast drops so if you've been waiting for the 1.0 of

401
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,720
 caves of cudd you can i assume that's how you pronounce qud you can go and get it on

402
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,320
 thursday in the 1.0 but actually it's been around for a decade but i only just recently started playing

403
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,320
 it they've described it as a science fantasy rogue-like epic steeped in retrofuturism deep

404
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,840
 simulation and of swathes of sentient plants and it's kind of a lot of it is procedurally generated

405
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:34,080
 but actually there's quite a lot of underlying lore and plot so it is kind of like a giant

406
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:42,640
 open world fantasy epic game but also it's kind of like an asky rogue like it has graphics but they're

407
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:50,320
 they're little tiny little 16 by 16 pixel type graphics i love it it's so good

408
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,320
 it is the only reason it hasn't eaten my life is that i drag myself away from it periodically to do

409
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,240
 other things i keep dying there's a as well as the kind of proper rogue like permadeath

410
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,680
 approach to it you can also set it up so you play it like an rpg and when you die you respawn

411
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,000
 in the last town you were in so that might work and there's also a mode where you just wander

412
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,600
 around and nothing kills you very much so that you can make progress but i kind of like the kind

413
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,920
 of stabby version it's kind of in a post-apocalyptic world but it is it is much deeper than you might

414
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:34,080
 expect and it is doing much more with with lore than is normal for a procedurally generated game

415
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,280
 and i just want to say go and play it it's going to be on me hugo valet because it is getting its

416
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,160
 1.0 release so clearly it is eligible for 2025 and for those of you who've been out there saying

417
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:50,400
 well i've been playing it since 2030 or something well yeah no i know that's true but it's new and

418
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:58,880
 old at the same time way sounds good and and like many rogue likes um amazing things happen to you

419
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:07,120
 so you find you're in alliance with sentient worms and and meanwhile um and you get you get

420
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:14,080
 artifacts that cause everybody to turn into goo which you know there's all sorts of all sorts of

421
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,320
 bizarre things happen to you in this game every game nice i will put it on my steam wish list

422
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:27,440
 it's also on itch.io and gog we will have links in the show notes listeners and it costs £24

423
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,400
 and £99 but obviously if what you like in your life is huge 3d graphics then it is not for you

424
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,720
 because it's really it is a game of alasky road like sense even though it's not actually using

425
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,960
 asky as using it's using graphical bits i am also going to pick a game and i am also going to pick

426
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,920
 a game that came out quite a while ago in a early access equivalent and has had its first

427
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,240
 edition this year and i am going to pick mothership mothership is a science fiction horror role playing

428
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,040
 game it is a tabletop role playing game not a video role playing game yeah so it came out in kind of

429
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,720
 early 2024 in the first edition and i have been playing it lately and it's very very good

430
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,840
 it's a very simple system which does a very good job of establishing how GMs should GM and players

431
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,840
 should play through it's quite small and snappy um rule books and i'm really impressed with it and

432
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:34,080
 i'm really enjoying um running it for some friends when i do and there's so much content for it available

433
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:40,320
 kind of online through the um like the community doing third party material and that's something

434
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,360
 that the developers Tuesday night games have really embraced and that's part of what makes it so

435
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:52,240
 wonderful um but yeah it's very lovely very lovely very well done game and it's published by Tuesday

436
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,920
 night games and i think Liz is familiar with two rooms in a boom um but Tuesday night games were

437
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,640
 the publishers of two rooms in a boom and they are also the upcoming publishers of uh were wolf in

438
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,920
 the dark um so they make some they make some neat games generally um but yeah mothership's really

439
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,440
 good and thank you very much to laurie anderson and kevin anderson of the hugo girl podcast for

440
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,080
 bringing me my mothership box to Glasgow because yeah that was very lovely of them tying into that

441
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:25,760
 is currently mothership month which means on back a kit there's a bunch of mothership crowd

442
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,280
 funding happening right now and you can go and get your grubby mitts on loads of different products

443
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,960
 and by the time uh you listen to this there will be i think probably four or five days left on that

444
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:46,320
 crowd funding experience um i have perhaps back to an unwise number of campaigns um but i have no

445
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,440
 regrets mhm lizzy you're gonna pick something like a book or are you also going to pick a game

446
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,880
 now well that's it now since you've both picked games i'm gonna pick a game just so we all match

447
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,600
 yes i wasn't going to pick this game because i picked the precursor game not that long ago um as

448
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,920
 one of my picks but i will pick rise of the golden idol which is a sequel to curse of the golden idol

449
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,400
 it is another excellent little puzzle game which you can play on multiple platforms you can also

450
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,800
 play it through netflix if you have netflix and basically did you like curse the golden idol then

451
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,960
 you'll probably very much like rise a golden idol which is the same except i like the graphic style

452
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,800
 a little bit better i think it's a little bit clearer on smaller screens and i think it's

453
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,520
 um there were some puzzles in the expansions for curse of golden idol which were really like i

454
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,360
 could not could not get through them i had to get some hints whereas this one um i think everything

455
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,360
 was kind of at the right difficulty level there was only one bit where i got stuck and then when i

456
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,240
 got a hint i was like oh fine that's what you meant kind of moment but basically they're just

457
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,200
 they're just satisfying and i had them on my phone and kept kind of poking away at them for five or

458
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,040
 ten minutes and like unlocking another little bit of the puzzle and then putting it away and trying

459
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:07,120
 again and then i basically went through like the last final bit in like three hours one night and

460
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:13,120
 had a lovely time hmm that sounds good i have not played the first one yet but it is on the list

461
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:20,160
 it's on my phone i also thought it was pretty great that right after i bought a playstation 5 i decided

462
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:26,160
 to play a tiny adventure game on my phone this is this is why i do not yet have a playstation 5

463
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:33,440
 i actually the the reason the proper reason i have not um played your pick from tovah week is that i

464
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,200
 almost never play games on my phone or on my computer i almost always play them on playstation

465
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,680
 or switch so maybe i should look up to see whether these games are on consoles i'm pretty sure golden

466
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,920
 idling on switch golden island is on switch um i don't know if it's via netflix on switch or

467
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,600
 don't think so i think you have to get it life on that was the ott thought podcast and it's a good

468
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:13,520
 bye for me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

469
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,520
 it's an interesting interesting psychology there right i don't want to buy it for money on a platform

470
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,800
 because i could play it for free but the thing i can play it for free on is the thing i never

471
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,880
 play games on so therefore i don't play it and i'm like this is this is old psychology this is poor

472
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,680
 psychology you know i understand why people do it but but there are lots of times for example do you

473
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,760
 ever buy a coffee in a cafe rather than going oh no if i was a tome i could just make myself a cup of

474
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,160
 coffee but i'm not a tome so i would have to buy a cup of coffee in this cafe and i don't do that

475
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:58,960
 because i could be at home making coffee so you buy things this is this is a terrible analogy

476
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,760
 no it's not it's exactly the same thing the point is it's convenient for you to have it on the switch

477
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,200
 or your ps5 so you buy it rather than playing it for free on the thing that it's free on but the

478
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,640
 thing is that when i am playing on my ps5 my phone is in my pocket if i was in a cafe and i had brought

479
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,080
 with me a coffee that i had made at home i would drink the coffee from home and they would throw

480
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:23,200
 me out the cafe that's where i'm at in this analogy do you ever get takeaway food because your kitchen

481
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,160
 is right there in your house i get takeaway food i couldn't make i couldn't make as well as i can at

482
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,360
 home but they're identical games us and i also sometimes pay for Netflix instead of watching

483
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,600
 aspania do interpretive dance my point i think is that this analogy is limited i have a better

484
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:46,240
 analogy but first can i pay to see aspania do interpretive dance uh aspania please write in i think

485
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:51,520
 about analogy is when i own a book on paper and then i buy it on kindle so it's easier for me to

486
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,920
 cart about with me on my kindle the preferred reading experience for me which i have done see i

487
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,960
 don't i don't do that i just take the book with yeah but what if it's really big i mean i'm reading

488
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,840
 the book of love by kelly link and it is really big at eliz but i am still ready to get on dead tree

489
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:12,800
 oh yeah yeah i read that on the kindle it's fair i was going to say i guess you're reading a lot of

490
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,120
 paper books still yes john at the moment for sure i do quite like paper books i basically like books

491
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:25,920
 i am not quite as militant as some are in this i just like books and i don't really care what format

492
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,040
 they're in yeah i mean i did buy i have bought handbags specifically because they are the correct

493
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,800
 size to fit all minus s season including a kindle the theme music for this episode was
