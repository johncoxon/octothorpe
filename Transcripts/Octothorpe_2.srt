1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,920
We'll do follow up. We'll mention what Hogg said. We'll say that Alison got lots of

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,480
supportive comments that can't be printed, which sounds filthy.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,800
It does. Yes, but let's do an actual podcast no more than an hour because then I need to eat my

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:16,980
dinner.

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,500
Hello and welcome to episode two of Octothorpe, the podcast about sci-fi and science fiction.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,620
I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,820
I'm Alison Scott.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,780
And I'm Liz Betty.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,740
We are riding on the heels of a phenomenally successful episode one. We have had a letter

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,640
of comments. We've actually had a couple of comments. So Andrew Hogg criticised my metaphor

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,420
choices. He said that sticking plasters over hurdles is not a thing that happens in athletics,

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,040
but in my defence, I was always terrible at athletics, so that may be why. Alison, I believe

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,360
you also got some comments.

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,420
I did, but they were all in a private members-only mailing list, so I cannot repeat them here.

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:05,900
Yay!

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,260
But they were all very nice. Everyone was very impressed by the podcast and was like, do more

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,920
of that. It's just what we need in these straightened times.

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,300
We also had an email of comment from Murray Moore, who told us all about what he's reading.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,640
A Sour Apple Tree by John Blackburn and Bunce, which is collected columns about baseball, which

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,400
sounds very good if you like baseball.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,360
But not science fictional. Not science fictional, unless baseball is present in the future, which

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,700
it may be. We don't know. We have not been there. He also mentioned that we haven't mentioned mailing

23
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,280
lists in our discussion of virtual fandom last episode. So would either of you like to talk

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,540
about mailing lists?

25
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,540
Well, I could talk a bit about fan history and say that virtual fandom is a bit of an odd concept

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,340
because fandom was always virtual. It started as a way for people to keep in touch with people

27
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,660
all over the world who shared this same weird interest. What's happened here is that the rest

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:03,720
of the world has caught up with the sort of things that fans do, rather than fans necessarily

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,660
changing what they do. So there are all over the world, there are pockets of science fiction

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,920
fans keeping in touch in much the ways they always have done. And a lot of those ways are

31
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,820
through emailing lists, where somebody sends an email and sometimes later somebody else replies.

32
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,580
And confusion rains.

33
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,320
Confusion does often rain.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,500
Yes, well, I have a long standing mailing list of me and some fan-ish friends. But actually

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,140
what's happened is that the mailing list traffic has dwindled and been replaced with WhatsApp

36
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,300
and Discord. And if that's what happened is we keep starting up WhatsApp channels whenever

37
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,280
we're at a convention in order to coordinate sensible things like eating and are there any more seats

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,100
left in room 2B for that interesting panel. And then we just keep it going because we kind

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,060
of enjoy talking to each other. And in this time more than ever. So those are all sort of

40
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,160
back reactivate again. And we also have Discord and so on as well. So the mailing list is actually

41
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,020
dying a little bit. But I'm not sad because it's been replaced with other things.

42
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,080
Yeah, and I think I'm on various fan-ish mailing lists. There is a top secret mailing list full

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,600
of fan fund winners. And most of that is very good natured. There has been a flurry of discussion

44
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,540
in light of recent events. But we will get to that a bit later in the show. Liz mentioned Discord

45
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,200
and there is also now a BSFA Discord. If you are a member of the British Science Fiction

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,960
Association or if you are not, but you would like to talk to people who are, you can join

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,940
their Discord. And it's reasonably low traffic at the moment. I don't know what they're planning

48
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,780
to do with it. But I will put a link in the show notes. Are you on a Discord, Alison? Have

49
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,280
you been doing much Discording?

50
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,460
I have not been doing much Discording, but I am on many Discord. So what I find with Discord

51
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,260
is that I'll be doing something, some activity and a Discord will pop up around that. And

52
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,480
for a while, we will have a flurry of activity and it will be very useful. But I'm not using

53
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,940
Discord at the moment for any part of my social life, I don't think. I do use Slack a bit when

54
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,560
we're talking about things like that for a group of people who I work with. So it's not necessarily

55
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,540
a science fictional thing at all. In fact, it's not. But that's only a social space, not really

56
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,500
a workspace. We talk about things like how to make money, which at the moment is, yeah,

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:13,900
don't.

58
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,440
Yeah, we have a Discord and we have morning tea or afternoon tea for people in the wrong time

59
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,700
zones every morning. And that's really nice. And for me, Slack is mostly a workplace. So

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,480
I don't usually check that outside the work day. How are you? How are you finding Discord,

61
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,800
Liz? Are you a member of lots of Discords or only a couple?

62
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm a member of only one Discord because I think I'd previously assumed it was sort of for

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,140
gaming mostly. But actually, it's just like IRC, which was a key part of my social life in the

64
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,440
pre-Discord times, except it's much easier to spontaneously have voice conversations with

65
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,780
people. So I'm really enjoying it. Yeah. And I use Slack only for work. So it's nice to keep

66
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,780
that division of Slack is for work, Discord is for non-work situations.

67
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:01,160
Yeah, I think Discord and Slack are very similar in some ways. Discord started as a way of letting

68
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,940
gamers do voice chat and has kind of grown beyond that. And Slack started as a way to let work

69
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,200
colleagues talk to each other in serious text conversations and has grown beyond that. And

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,640
they have kind of slowly been moving towards the middle from opposite directions, which has been

71
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,380
quite interesting to watch. The other big technology that has been used quite a lot recently is Zoom.

72
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:31,580
So Alison, you ran a first Thursday pub meeting on Zoom. And I was curious to see what your thoughts

73
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,540
about that were and how it went. I think I should start by saying there are a great many video

74
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:44,020
conferencing options. And Zoom has emerged, I think, pretty well everywhere as having probably the best

75
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:51,920
combination of ease of use and ability to deliver quality audio and video over quite small brand

76
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,040
within a lot of cases for quite a lot of people. So it's just got the sweet spot of the package.

77
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,340
I looked at, I wanted to run a virtual first Thursday meeting for people who don't know that

78
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,080
London fans have been meeting on the first Thursday of the month ever since 1946 in a variety of London

79
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,380
pubs. And we couldn't do it this month. And so I thought it would be good to have a virtual thing.

80
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,520
And the people in the first Thursday Facebook group thought that it would be quite a good thing.

81
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,100
So I set about exhaustively testing every video conference or solution available, try and find

82
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,040
one that would help us do that. And what I didn't want was something where the 50 or so people who

83
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,840
might turn up on a Thursday night would all cram into one video conferencing space and have it go,

84
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,580
oh, well, I can't have 50 people all talking at once. If you actually go to a real pub,

85
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,020
you go and sit at tables. And what happens at the first Thursday is that people mostly go and

86
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:50,480
sit at the same table every time. So there'll be a table that mostly has ZZ9 people on it. And

87
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,440
there'll be a table that mostly has old farts on it. And there'll be a table for people who want to

88
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,160
talk seriously about science fiction. And there'll be a table for people who want to smock the Easter

89
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:07,560
con. And what we were trying to do was recreate some sense of that in Zoom by using Zoom's breakout rooms

90
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,020
to essentially act as these tables. And it turns out that video conferencing for business,

91
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,780
they don't think that people are going to want to move around between the breakout rooms regularly or

92
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,360
dash away from their breakout room because somebody started to be boring and nip off for a smoke.

93
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,800
Though actually, I've been at work conferences where that has been the case.

94
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,180
So it turned out to be quite complicated to set up. And I did it by getting a paid Zoom account,

95
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,240
making everyone in the meeting co-hosts. And then after that, they could move themselves around

96
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,280
between these rooms. We had no password. Our security strategy was if anyone tries to do anything

97
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,020
naughty, we'd boot them, which is not the most elaborate security strategy. And it worked fantastically.

98
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,820
And everyone had a lot of fun. And we had about 40 people or so. And we had a really good evening,

99
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,760
except mostly my fun was mostly the fun of sorting it all out. So it felt more like

100
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,020
con-running type fun rather than sitting around in a pub type fun. But I have been having a lot of

101
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,580
sitting around in the pub type fun on many video conferencing services. So I don't want to suggest

102
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,780
that I've been missing out on that. The only thing I've missed out on is the hangovers, really,

103
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,140
and trying to get back from London and the tube at two o'clock in the morning, having not entirely

104
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,520
worked out what I was doing. I've missed that. There's no reason you couldn't recreate the

105
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,040
hangover experience in the comfort of your own home. It turns out that there's a, the amount I want

106
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,840
to drink on Zoom seems to be lower than the amount I want to drink in the pub, which is quite good,

107
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,000
really. I mean, we do have beer and it's quite nice. And we've been buying beer from local breweries

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,240
and that's good. It's not quite such a drinking experience. The beer is vastly better. We had two

109
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:54,060
notable groups of spies on our chat. The first was the Yomsvikings trying to work out whether this would

110
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:01,340
be effective for a virtual Yoms thing, which is a book discussion where traditionally one person holds

111
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,940
the speaking object and speaks at any time. And the first Thursday group, the Vanguard group in Seattle

112
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,780
turned up to see whether they thought they would be able to run a Seattle meeting using the same

113
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,180
technology. So, so it's kind of spreading. And I think it's worth noting that the Toronto

114
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,940
fandom also has a first Thursday meeting, which I think started because people from London went over

115
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,880
to Toronto and introduced it. So I think it is not an accident that is the same day, but it's kind of

116
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,820
nice to think that there are fans all over the world who meet on a first Thursday. One of the reasons I

117
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,160
didn't come to the first Thursday is because I don't usually come to the first Thursday. And I thought

118
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,220
going along, if everyone who doesn't usually go had clicked on the button, I was a bit worried it would

119
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,420
get overwhelmed. So I did not go.

120
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,840
In practice, it was fine. But also, one of the things that happened on Thursday was that we got

121
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,580
some people who have been to the first Thursday from time to time, but because they live in Australia or

122
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:01,840
Canada or Seattle or wherever, do not habitually get to it. And that included at least one regular

123
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,880
who's just moved to New Zealand. So obviously, it was very nice to see them. The other group of people

124
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,460
who got there were people who would love to go to the first Thursday and who are London fans,

125
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:17,480
but who can't manage the stairs up to that back room. And so any fans who can't manage stairs,

126
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,280
this is actually enabling for them.

127
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,940
Do you think you will do it again next month?

128
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:29,020
Yeah, we'll certainly have some form of virtual meeting every month that the pubs are closed,

129
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,460
certainly.

130
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,580
Technically speaking, I believe as we record that it is two weeks away from the government's

131
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,660
proposed see whether everything has gotten better and we can relax the restrictions deadline.

132
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,380
Yeah, would you like to make a small bet?

133
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,700
I mean, given how much things changed in between us recording and the episode going out last week,

134
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,520
I'm very hesitant. But yeah, propose your bet, Alison. We'll see. We'll see.

135
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,140
I bet it won't have. I do not think that the pubs will be open for some considerable time.

136
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,980
I think you might be right about that.

137
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,520
Certainly not May, probably not June. Let's hope on July. What I think we might get quicker than

138
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,880
that is small gatherings.

139
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,040
Yes. Well, yes, maybe. I don't know. Liz, you're an expert.

140
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,660
Yes, but there are also lots of other experts who are more expert than me who've given their

141
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,240
opinion on this. So I will cowardly defer to them. But also, I think when they release the

142
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,300
restrictions a bit, people are going to stay local. So I think like gatherings where you go and see

143
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:32,380
someone nearby that you can walk to may be things that are regained earlier than ones where you have

144
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,460
to go and get on public transport and go to a pub on the other side of London. So I think it's all

145
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,300
going to kind of go in waves, perhaps. But it's also, I don't know if they've reopened sort of

146
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,240
restaurants and bars and things in Shanghai and Wuhan yet. So that might be an interesting path to look at.

147
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:55,100
My understanding is that restaurants and bars are open in China with some restrictions, but the cinemas

148
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,060
and theatres have not reopened. They tried to reopen them and then changed their minds pretty quickly. But

149
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,900
again, I've not been following this in great detail. So I might just be totally wrong about that.

150
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,880
I would like to urge our listeners not to take medical advice from us. Please look at what the

151
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,360
NHS and the government are saying. We are but people discussing interesting things.

152
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:21,040
What I would say that's science fictional about this is that if I ever read a science fiction book again,

153
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,960
where society has dramatically changed in the way that personal interactions work or work works or

154
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,620
things of that kind, unless it gives me a trigger event for that change to have happened, I'm just

155
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,300
going to say, no, no, no, these things don't happen by gradual change. It turns out that they are,

156
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:45,120
backtriggered by events. And what we have seen here is a big old trigger event. Lots of old people are now

157
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,400
doing video chats because we had a trigger event. Yeah, I mean, my grandmother has worked out how to

158
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,640
text, which may be the first time that she has successfully done that. And my parents were already

159
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,360
relatively comfortable with video chatting. So that is not a huge change. But yeah, I've noticed some

160
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,840
changes in behaviour. I think many people were already comfortable with it just because of the

161
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,440
globalised nature of things before the trigger event, as you put it. There are a lot of parents

162
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,100
and grandparents who are not necessarily living in the same country as their children, their

163
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,520
grandchildren, and they've all learned how to video chat. So they don't miss the important life events.

164
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,600
Yeah, there are lots of disabled people who have been asking for the ability to work from home

165
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,020
for many, many years and have been told, no, we could not possibly do your very important work from home.

166
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,740
And they have been very angry that the world has suddenly worked out that the vast majority of jobs

167
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,440
can in fact be done from home perfectly well.

168
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,600
Again, it's trigger events, like you say. As much as I think the impetus should have been there earlier for

169
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,900
accessibility reasons, you're right that this is the big push that people needed to make that actually

170
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,240
work. Last episode, Eastercon had just cancelled and we were discussing the reasons why that might be.

171
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,760
We haven't yet gone into lockdown in the UK. In the intervening three days, we did in fact get a lot

172
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,760
closer to lockdown. We were advised to shelter in place and hotels were advised to shut by the government.

173
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,520
So Eastercon would have been cancelled either way. It's amazing how much things changed in three days.

174
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,280
In the couple of weeks since the last episode, Con Zealand have announced that they are also not running,

175
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,160
as we predicted last episode, and are going to do a virtual convention.

176
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,080
So how do we feel about the idea of a virtual world con?

177
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,160
That is one of the issues here, which is when I pay for a world con, which is a reasonably expensive

178
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,620
proposition just for the membership. I'm paying for physical, tangible things, like because I know

179
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,620
that my money is going towards essentially the rental of a large, expensive venue and all the

180
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,660
associated costs with that. And when you get to a virtual con, apart from the costs of managing to

181
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,140
host it, which will be probably considerable, but nothing like as much as hosting a physical venue,

182
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,180
a lot of the work that will go into it is the work that people were already doing as volunteers for the

183
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,160
world con. So I think it's going to be very difficult to try and get a pricing structure that will work.

184
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,600
As for refunds, I don't know how much money has already been spent and cannot be recouped. So I can

185
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,300
see why they might not be doing refunds. But I'd be very interested to see where they pitch the rate

186
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,580
for new memberships.

187
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,740
They have said that they are going to refund the difference between attending and online memberships

188
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:31,020
when the price for online membership goes live, which I think at the time of recording is supposed to be

189
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,940
the 15th of April.

190
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:39,960
I am not persuaded yet of the value proposition of an online world con. I think that this is a very hard task

191
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:46,180
to manage. We manage our existing world cons by having a lot of extremely talented volunteers who work in areas

192
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:52,060
they always work in, know how to do those things and make them work. An example of the sorts of difficulties here

193
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,220
are that a friend of mine, having listened to our podcast, said, well, that would be a great model for the

194
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,840
world con. You could record a panel and then do it like that. And I was like, but John will have put in many hours

195
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:09,080
of editing. I mean, a thousand hours, maybe. I don't know. Many hours of editing on Octothorpe One.

196
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,540
And there's no way that's going to happen for the hundreds or thousands of panels that you have at a world con.

197
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,900
You know, that volunteer resource just isn't there.

198
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,800
I was thinking about this. I mean, I think it could work. You'd have to treat every panel as a sort of

199
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,700
Zoom style breakout room where only your panelists are on video and audio and everyone else is forcibly muted.

200
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,620
And at the end, you let them selectively unmute themselves to ask questions. But you need the person

201
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,800
who is normally sitting at the back of the room fiddling with the levels on the microphones to be

202
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,360
the person who is in that room, like enforcing that with an iron fist for it to work at all.

203
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,860
At the last Eastercon, they had a model where they passed a book around the audience and people wrote

204
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,660
questions in it that they wanted to ask John Scalzi, who was the guest of honour. And at the end,

205
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,340
they chose questions from the book and read them. And I think that had two very big advantages. It meant

206
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,040
that the person who was doing the interview could scan through and find the next interesting question

207
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,220
while John was answering the previous one. And it also meant the person scanning through could look

208
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,660
for sentences that had question marks at the end, which completely brought to an end the,

209
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,420
this is more of a comment than a question phenomenon, which I don't know about you two,

210
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,060
but it is my firm opinion can die and go in the sea. I don't know if you think that would translate

211
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,940
well, but that's how I would do it if I was going to, which of course I am not.

212
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:30,140
Unlike running a virtual pub meeting, this is a problem which is very well established in

213
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,700
professional video conferencing users. And they do both of those models. So it's normal for

214
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,120
professional video conferencing setups to have a number of people who are allowed to speak and

215
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,280
everybody else be auto muted. And then I've seen both of those other ways work. Either you have a

216
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,720
text chat that everybody has access to and people type things in it, or you have a text chat that

217
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,420
everybody has access to, but only the moderators can read. So they can be reading what's coming in on it.

218
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,460
Or you can have a thing where people just click a button if they want to speak. And then those people

219
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,780
are called on in turn. And I've seen all of those systems work. I've seen the system work where people

220
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,460
type their question, but then the moderator calls on that person to speak. And so all of those things

221
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,420
are fine. As well as the moderator who's allegedly the moderator of the panel, you almost certainly

222
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,660
need two more people. One managing the audio for the panel in the way that the tech person at the back

223
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:26,920
of the room would. And one actually managing that text chat and making sure that any actual bad actors

224
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,480
are booted.

225
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,340
So I think it's interesting because the problem is that the panels are only one part of the experience.

226
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:41,080
And I cannot see myself sitting at my laptop for four or six hours a day watching online panels in the way

227
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,860
that at Worldcon I would actually physically go to those panels. So I think we've got to take that into account.

228
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,940
I think you're right. And I think that's one of the things I want to bring up, which was a criticism I saw

229
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:58,180
on various mailing lists I'm a member of, which is a real division between people who wondered

230
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,560
to what extent it was not worth having a virtual Worldcon because the social aspect of the Worldcon

231
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:10,200
is really the primary motivator for them. And to what extent it's worth putting on a Worldcon,

232
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,780
because obviously having something is better than nothing. And it's not like there's a mystical option

233
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,380
where we just have the Worldcon anyway, and we all get exactly what we want.

234
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,700
So it really is a choice between having nothing at all or having some online offering.

235
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:30,080
I don't think I would pay as much as I would pay for a normal attending membership in order to

236
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,200
attend a virtual convention. But equally, I can see an argument that it's better to have

237
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,060
something on rather than just completely abandoning it.

238
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,560
If they run a virtual con, at what time are they going to do it?

239
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,540
That's a really good question because you don't want to isolate, you don't want to exclude the local

240
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,020
fandom, but you equally don't want to exclude the US fandom.

241
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,920
I don't know this for sure. I haven't looked at the membership numbers, but I strongly suspect the US

242
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,760
contingent was the biggest contingent. It usually is at any given Worldcon. And so it's a very,

243
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,460
very good question.

244
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,300
I think in some ways it's not the US which is a problem. So I'm just looking at the Hugo

245
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,360
finalist announcement, which will be on the 7th or the 8th, depending on your time zone.

246
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:16,340
And it's starting at 8am New Zealand time, which is 9pm in the UK, 4pm on the East Coast and 1pm on the West Coast.

247
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:25,400
So you can actually manage to find a time when I think New Zealand and the US are awake, but you cannot find a time when New Zealand and the US and Europe are awake.

248
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:32,400
And those of us in between New Zealand and Europe, I think we'll just end up giving up because I'm not sure there'll be any time that suits everyone.

249
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,240
Somebody has told me that as a result of everybody's lockdown, we now have two time zones globally, which are coffee and beer.

250
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,700
Yes, I've heard that too. And it's worryingly true.

251
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,660
So you're either in coffee time or beer time.

252
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:54,660
Yes, that is, I think, a very good point. I think that is a very good question of how they're going to do it.

253
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,220
My guess would be that it will be bad for Europe and I will not get to attend much of it.

254
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,020
But then again, I was not planning to go to New Zealand and would not have attended much of it anyway.

255
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,340
So perhaps I am not the person they need to be prioritising.

256
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:14,100
So now I can say something temperate about Guff, which is that they haven't, the Guff race is due to end next week.

257
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,060
And I was going to do a big push on, you know, the Guff race is due to end.

258
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,440
Please, everybody vote for me.

259
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,960
Though I can't say that because I wouldn't dream of being the campaigning type.

260
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,400
But they haven't really said what they're doing.

261
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:32,900
They've indicated privately that the plan is that the winner will attend the convention virtually and take their trip at a later date,

262
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,760
which seems completely fine to me and I would have thought would be fine to lots of other people as well.

263
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
But it raises that question.

264
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,420
I mean, I'm very happy to attend the convention virtually in those circumstances,

265
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,040
but I certainly wouldn't be able to attend in the same way that I would in person.

266
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,380
And it would mean me almost certainly going on to night shift for a week in order to make it work.

267
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,520
And that's kind of slightly weird.

268
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,860
I mean, it's not impossible, but it's slightly weird.

269
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:07,580
Obviously, you're in a position where you miss out on Con Zealand being the destination World Cup, which we touched on last episode.

270
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,800
It's a great shame.

271
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,540
I think that rearranging the race for a future time and having the delegate get enthusiastically virtually involved is the best solution.

272
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:22,960
But it is a solution that does have a lot of logistical questions, as you say, and I'm not sure what the answer to any of that is.

273
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,900
I am very glad that I am not the administrator of a fan fund at this time, because it must be a nightmare for the administrators to decide what to do.

274
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,340
But I would like them to decide what to do, because there are some times when it's appropriate to take a decision.

275
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:42,640
And I think this is an announce it in time for the race to either be cancelled or to finish.

276
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,700
I suspect the race will not be cancelled because I suspect they will want there to be a delegate for the virtual convention that occurs.

277
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:57,120
Because not having Duff and Guff candidates when there is a Australasian World Cup would be a great shame.

278
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,800
And doing it this way means you can at least have some Fan Fund Canada involvement in the Worldcon, even if it is virtual.

279
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,180
Maybe they'll listen to this and write us a letter.

280
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,640
Yeah, they don't have a lot of time.

281
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,600
We've got a little bit of time.

282
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,420
I'll do a faster editing job. It will be fine.

283
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,000
So the Duff winner has been announced already, which is Erin Underwood.

284
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,380
It's a great choice for anyone who hasn't heard.

285
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,940
Fantastic choice.

286
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,500
Yes.

287
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,040
And it doesn't say anything about Erin going to Con Zealand.

288
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,580
It just says that she will try and travel in 2021.

289
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,560
But I assume that is also the goal.

290
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,960
I submitted my bond and a guarantee that I would attend the convention if I won.

291
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,880
Ha ha!

292
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,540
And travel. It's really weird.

293
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,280
And then, of course, when all this kicked off, I went, oh, that's interesting, isn't it?

294
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,600
So you have guaranteed that if you win, you will stay up all night virtually attending Con Zealand?

295
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,280
Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

296
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,920
Like, I wasn't going to do that anyway.

297
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,740
Easter Connors announced that they're going to run the bidding session for 2021 and 2022.

298
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,140
I was going to be the fanguest at Concentric, so I'm going to be holding a Zoom party.

299
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,320
I don't know if I should say this.

300
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,820
People who are interested in this should get in touch with me.

301
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,660
If I know you, I'll give you the details.

302
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,820
It's not going to be super secret.

303
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:21,240
Because if I was at the convention being fanguest of honour, then one of the things I would do is hold a definitely, definitely not official room party.

304
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,120
I think that's a good plan.

305
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:28,840
And I think you'll find that other people who might have done things at Easter Conn will be doing those things over next weekend.

306
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,100
Because otherwise, what are we going to do?

307
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,980
Like, I don't know.

308
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,080
What do people do at Easter if they're not at the Easter Conn?

309
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,300
This is hashtag privilege problems.

310
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,480
But because I am an academic, I get two extra days off around the Easter weekend.

311
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,260
So I've got six days of not having anything to do.

312
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,780
And it's just, oh, it's going to be tricky without Easter Conn there to kind of fill it up with stuff.

313
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,780
I think doing a Zoom thing or something is a really good idea.

314
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,580
And I also think that having it so that it's only people who would have been there anyway is a good idea, too.

315
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,420
I really don't want to suggest that only people who go to the Easter Conn can come to my party.

316
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,680
But I think I am going to suggest that only people who know me can come to my party.

317
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,860
I don't think that's unreasonable.

318
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,120
That's good, because then I can come to your party.

319
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,300
So I approve.

320
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,200
You definitely can come to my party.

321
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,080
Yes, you two are both invited.

322
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Liz, you would fall under both criteria because you currently have an Easter Conn attending membership.

323
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,820
I do.

324
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,100
But that's because it got to the point where I was trying to sell it.

325
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,200
And then I realised it was going to be cancelled.

326
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,420
And I felt bad selling someone a membership.

327
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,640
But then they would be on the hook.

328
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,520
How many hours ahead of us are you, Liz?

329
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,000
So this is the problem.

330
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
I am currently six hours ahead of you.

331
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,800
Which means while I would very much like to come to your party, it will be like the early

332
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,220
hours of the morning for me.

333
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,620
It will be in the early hours of the morning.

334
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,140
I mean, I suspect that the dregs of the party will just be as you're getting up.

335
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,460
It's that time that I cannot get to from either end, basically.

336
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,780
I cannot stay up late enough or get up early enough.

337
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,420
As yet, the only thing the Easter Conn committee have announced they are doing over the Easter

338
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,060
weekend virtually is the bid session, which probably means that there's not going to be

339
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,220
much programming happening.

340
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:09,380
So to what extent do you think British fandom are going to do any programming sort of as a

341
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,160
grassroots effort?

342
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,940
Do you think that there will be lots of room parties popping up?

343
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,120
Or do you think that it will be very ad hoc and we'll see Facebook posts at the time?

344
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,980
I mean, I've announced I'm doing something, but part of why I did that was to encourage

345
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,680
the others.

346
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,860
So I'm doing a thing and there's a bid session.

347
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,980
I was trying to hope by saying I'm doing a thing, then we might see some virtual book

348
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,040
launches or virtual author readings or things of that kind.

349
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,320
Because I think that would be quite fun.

350
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,360
There's a lot of virtual author readings going on right now anyway.

351
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,860
I see quite a lot of them pop up on Twitter and Facebook.

352
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:46,520
But I wonder if part of it is also that the committee have been understandably quiet.

353
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,520
But if I was organising things, I might not want to jump in enthusiastically in case they

354
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,540
were still planning something.

355
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,620
And as it gets later and later, it then becomes even less likely that anyone will jump in enthusiastically.

356
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,840
So that might be part of it.

357
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,900
Last week, we talked about giving the committee space and letting them work out what they wanted

358
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,180
to do and not having a big discussion either way.

359
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:11,600
But now, given that it's a week until Easter as we record, if they were planning to do something,

360
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,720
I think they would have announced it at this point.

361
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,420
And I think that it's completely legit that they don't want to because I think it is a very

362
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,060
different thing.

363
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,460
And, you know, they must be completely gutted that they can't run the convention they were

364
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,720
planning.

365
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,760
But I think at this point, it may be time to start trying to get the ball rolling on organising

366
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,600
some grassroots stuff.

367
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,740
And I think Alison's impetus to do that is a good one.

368
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,580
And I've got some ideas about things we could do.

369
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,440
We could do a live podcast recording.

370
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,960
It's only been a week.

371
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,340
Would it be okay to have a third Octothorpe?

372
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
Yeah, why not?

373
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,120
In only a week after the second.

374
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,820
We don't want to give the impression this is going to become a habit.

375
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,220
No, we could do.

376
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,200
We could have an Octothorpe Zoom party.

377
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,260
That could work.

378
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,300
Exclusive.

379
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,060
We each get two plus ones or one plus two, depending on how that works.

380
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm hoping that there will be stuff happening next weekend.

381
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,820
There was something that happened this weekend.

382
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,060
Yesterday was Wi-Fi Sci-Fi.

383
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,640
Did either of you hear about Wi-Fi Sci-Fi?

384
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,780
I did not.

385
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,720
Tell me about Wi-Fi Sci-Fi, John.

386
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,660
So I saw this on Glyn Morgan's Twitter feed.

387
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:16,280
I saw it after it had happened, because that is how all the best parties get heard about.

388
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,560
You hear about them after they finished.

389
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:23,280
But it was a Zoom convention which starred various luminaries.

390
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:38,540
It had Gareth Powell, Asia Walker, Michael Carey, Tata Thompson, Anne Cawler, Patrick Edwards, Jonathan Piddock, Aliette de Bodard, Kim, Laken Smith, Michael Rowley, Kevlyn Henney, Anna Chapman, Dave Hutchinson, Derek Kunskun, and Premay Mohamed.

391
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,900
But it had two panels.

392
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,100
It had cafe clutches, and it had a quiz.

393
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:49,720
And I believe the two panels are on YouTube for people who couldn't make it to the Zoom, because the Zoom was 90 people and there were more than 90 people interested.

394
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,440
I believe you can go and watch both of those on YouTube.

395
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,380
It looked like it was quite good.

396
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,500
The tweets I saw about it seemed to be people having a good time.

397
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,660
I'm a little bit annoyed I didn't hear about it when it was happening, as opposed to hearing about it the day after.

398
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:13,260
But I think that's often the way with a convention you see people tweeting while they were at the convention, and you did not see the marketing push leading up to the convention, which is distressingly common.

399
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,960
But it sounds like a really good idea.

400
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:24,520
I think two panels for a one-day convention virtually is probably about the right number, because I think Liz's point about not being able to sit for six hours in panels is probably right.

401
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:32,100
I think something like that next weekend, if anyone puts it together, I would enthusiastically get involved with.

402
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,420
It is interesting that I think everyone you listed who was on those panels was a science fiction author.

403
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:48,580
One of the things I do like about Eastercon is it tends to have fans and scientists and historians and people with non-writing expertise on the panel as well.

404
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,580
So it'd be nice if we could put together something that included all of those people.

405
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,140
I agree.

406
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,620
I'd obviously agree with that.

407
00:29:54,620 --> 00:30:05,180
We've been talking a lot about video conferencing software, and I think that a lot has been done over the last few weeks to really advance fandom's engagement with these tools.

408
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:13,260
Zoom has come under fire over the last week or so for various bits of bad practice to do with privacy.

409
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,120
I don't want to give the impression here that I don't think people should use Zoom.

410
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,340
Zoom is an incredible piece of software that's really helping people keep their mental health and their communication lines open.

411
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,600
I think that's great.

412
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:34,000
I do think it's worth being aware of some of Zoom's potential pitfalls and protecting yourself against them if it's something you mind.

413
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,480
And if it's not something you mind, obviously go wild.

414
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,020
But recently there have been a few bits of controversy.

415
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:46,100
Notably, they had some Facebook data in their iOS app that was sending data back to Facebook.

416
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:59,160
They had said that their chats were end-to-end encrypted, but it turned out that their encryption is not end-to-end and is in fact based on a slightly different encryption method to the method that they had said they used.

417
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,880
Their macOS installer abuses pre-installation scripts to install itself without letting you see what's it going to install.

418
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:17,200
And a few months ago, I think actually maybe a year ago, they had installed a local web server on every Mac they installed on, which let them reinstall their app even after you'd uninstalled it.

419
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:29,780
It is worth saying that they have published a blog post in the last few days that outline a 90-day plan to address a lot of these privacy concerns and that they are working very hard to address them.

420
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,820
And I appreciate those points got more and more technical and less and less understandable as time goes on.

421
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,780
I will put links in the show notes.

422
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:43,920
And as I say, I want to emphasise that I am advising people be careful rather than stop using it altogether.

423
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:50,200
But both of you, to what extent do you think this is a thing we need to be super concerned about?

424
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,580
And to what extent do you think that this is something that we just need to be mindful of?

425
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:06,700
I think that a lot of the people who are making the most noise about Zoom use either A, Facebook, or B, emailing lists, both of which are notably less secure than Zoom.

426
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:12,660
So these Zooms are clearly a bunch of white boys, honestly.

427
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,500
They started this company.

428
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,920
They made a good product.

429
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,780
They did not care about privacy.

430
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,460
And they clearly failed in three different areas.

431
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:30,740
The first is that they have a load of kind of corporate spying stuff so that your boss can spy on you, which is, I think, fairly normal for corporate software.

432
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:38,800
They didn't care in the sense that other people's security things, they just kind of worked around if that way they got to make a better product.

433
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,720
So they basically went, aha, can we make a better product by entering operating systems by the back door?

434
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,340
Yes, we can.

435
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,120
We should do that.

436
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:54,020
And the third is they left great gaping holes in their security accidentally while they were busy trying to make a better product.

437
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,840
And they ended up with a better product.

438
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,900
And now they're going, OK, so clearly everyone's using our product because it's better.

439
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,360
We should probably go back and fix those holes we left in it, which I think is fair.

440
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,500
It's not the best way to behave, but it is better.

441
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,280
It is noticeably better for any video chat over eight people.

442
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,320
And it's probably better for most of the ones under that, except possibly Microsoft Teams.

443
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,960
People think Microsoft Teams is very good, but everything else is definitely worse.

444
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,300
I will agree with you.

445
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,220
I think that they have clearly made a good product and now they are fixing it.

446
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,900
I think part of the reason they are fixing it is because there has been so much criticism.

447
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,140
So I do think, I do think strong.

448
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,000
Absolutely.

449
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,740
Absolutely.

450
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,400
They wouldn't be fixing it if they weren't forced to.

451
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,320
Yeah, I think, I think strong criticism is an important part of that.

452
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,540
And that is the spirit in which I criticize.

453
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:47,720
So I've been using Zoom for ages because it just worked better than all the alternatives.

454
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,660
So I mean, I do a lot of video conferencing anyway, and I do a lot of video conferencing

455
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,380
with people who have pretty terrible internet connections.

456
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,240
And Zoom was noticeably better than any of the alternatives for that.

457
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,260
It was better than WebEx.

458
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,700
It was better than Google Hangouts.

459
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,220
It was better than Skype.

460
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,280
I mean, we didn't try running work chats on Facebook Messenger, but I suspect it's better than that.

461
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,960
Oh God, Facebook Messenger is awful.

462
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,700
Oh my God.

463
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:15,340
So I'm quite, I think I feel I'm quite relaxed about it in that I know it does some terrible things,

464
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,420
but I sort of assume all software is doing some terrible things,

465
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,400
unless I'm using one of the real, like good open source ones that have, you know,

466
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,360
been built from the ground up for that kind of thing.

467
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,740
So I'm glad people are aware of these things.

468
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm glad people are pointing them out and that they fix them.

469
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,600
But otherwise I'm not too wound up about it.

470
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,980
I should say I do use Microsoft Teams a lot now because all our work,

471
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,560
all our work, well, everything basically is moved to Office 365.

472
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,960
And Microsoft Teams just works really nicely and it just works a lot of the time.

473
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,900
We haven't run a really huge event in it yet, but we are swapping our weekly seminars to Microsoft Teams.

474
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,140
And they will be, you know, we sometimes have got up to 100 people in there.

475
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,160
So I'll see how that works.

476
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,200
It's very corporate.

477
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,660
I want to say two things in reaction to that.

478
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,780
I'm going to push back slightly on the thing you said about every software doing this.

479
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,740
I think Zoom is more egregious than most so far.

480
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,220
I think the point about Facebook is a reasonable one.

481
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,460
Facebook are obviously in some ways much more egregious than almost anyone else.

482
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,860
But at this point, my neighborhood community group is on Facebook.

483
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,580
My streets WhatsApp group is obviously hosted on a Facebook owned service.

484
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,980
All of the local shops put their opening times and announcements on Facebook.

485
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:40,220
So at this point, I must use Facebook to take part in my community, which is something I resent hugely, but does appear to be distressingly true.

486
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,520
I will say Microsoft Teams is very good.

487
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,380
I think that the problem there is obviously you need an Office 365 subscription, which not everyone has.

488
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:54,340
I don't think Microsoft have made any overtures towards making Teams free to use.

489
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:01,060
I suspect because they see Skype as their consumer chatting tool and they don't see Microsoft schemes as something they need to open up.

490
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,940
But whereas Zoom, I believe, have relaxed a lot of their restrictions in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

491
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,520
Oh, Alison is shaking her head.

492
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,080
Teams doesn't have a free tier, but only the host needs to have the paid account.

493
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
I think that's the important thing.

494
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,620
And Office 365 is not expensive if there's just one of you and you're using it for this sort of thing.

495
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,800
People kept saying with the Zoom account, because I got a paid Zoom account to do the first Thursday,

496
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,560
oh, do you want some help with the cost?

497
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,900
And I said, well, compared to getting a tube ticket to the pub and buying one pint of beer, it was there.

498
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,040
That was the amount.

499
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,540
So these tools are not expensive compared to the life we've just given up to get them.

500
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,780
So, yeah, that is my crumble.

501
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,480
And also nobody cares about your video chats and the pub isn't exactly a secure environment either.

502
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,600
I don't think the cabinet should be using Zoom.

503
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,300
I did think that was a bit shocking.

504
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,820
And no doubt they've done magic cabinet things.

505
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,600
But seeing as they don't for anything else, it doesn't seem very likely that they really have this either.

506
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,860
Well, that's one other thing, which is because Zoom uses a predictable naming scheme for archives of the chats,

507
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:14,080
the Washington Post was able to reverse engineer it to see stuff like therapy sessions and things that had been conducted over Zoom.

508
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,600
And so I do think that there are problems here that do need addressing.

509
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,540
But I entirely take the point, especially for the first Thursday, it sounded like it was by far the best tool for the job.

510
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,420
But I do think you've just got to be careful and just be aware.

511
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,080
And I will post links in the show notes to help you do that.

512
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,680
Let's do a short Stay Insane in the Apocalypse bit to round out the show.

513
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,960
And then we can go back to having nothing to do.

514
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,520
I was going to call you out for your privilege on six days over Easter and talk about having nothing to do,

515
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,860
because a lot of people I know are actually losing their jobs now,

516
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,960
that their business has kept them on for a little while.

517
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,120
But the work has now dried up.

518
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,120
The cash flow isn't there.

519
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,880
And they've had to let people go rather than furlough them.

520
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,160
So people are losing their jobs.

521
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,220
And that is very sad.

522
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,680
And it's happening quite a lot.

523
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,780
And by quite a lot.

524
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,700
If you look at this map for the United States,

525
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:17,940
where the spike in the unemployment rate is something like 10 times the largest unemployment spike in the last 50 years.

526
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,660
So that's a big thing.

527
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,280
I have had to give up my business for the time being.

528
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,760
I mean, it will come back and all will be well.

529
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,720
But all of my income has dried up because the print-on-demand sites have basically stopped shipping T-shirts now.

530
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,920
And I decided I couldn't run an Etsy store at a point where we were likely to get sick quite soon.

531
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,660
And people kept asking me where their stuff was.

532
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:49,680
I did have a 24-hour period when I'd finally got my much-delayed shipment from China and sent all my old pins and sent some new pins.

533
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,780
And then I decided, no, it's time to shut for a bit.

534
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,500
But I'm fine.

535
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,980
People should not be worried about me.

536
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,200
But people should be worried about all of the people who have no income and no savings, of whom they're a great thing.

537
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,960
Yeah, and that's why I say I'm privileged.

538
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,300
I think I am still employed and my job does not require me to go anywhere.

539
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,740
So I think I am incredibly lucky that that is the case.

540
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,840
And I don't want anyone to think that I am unaware of that because I am.

541
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,240
I am very aware of that.

542
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,680
You also mentioned post.

543
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,480
And I have been getting things posted to my house.

544
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,200
And a few of them have taken a long time.

545
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,980
But I did order something at 12 p.m. on Friday that was delivered at 12 p.m. on Saturday last weekend,

546
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,800
which I was a little bit confused by because I thought the post was taking longer.

547
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,760
And that one just seemed to sail through.

548
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,060
And I'm not entirely sure why.

549
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:37,080
I'm not really ordering a lot through the actual postal service because I don't tend to post mail letters or things like that.

550
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:42,880
But also because Thailand has a thriving system of motorbike delivery guys and messenger guys.

551
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,800
So, for instance, I ordered some gin at about, I think, 4 p.m. on Thursday.

552
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,000
And about 5 p.m. a man on a motorbike turned up with my gin.

553
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,960
It's pretty good.

554
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,100
We ordered some beer from Wild Card Brewery.

555
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,580
A link is in the show notes.

556
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,420
Who are one of the breweries around the corner from us.

557
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,420
And they delivered it just within a few hours of us ordering it.

558
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,440
But that was not postal.

559
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,620
That was indeed a bloke from the brewery in a van.

560
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,960
Yes, we get veg boxes.

561
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,000
We've had veg boxes delivered ever since we've lived in this house.

562
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,520
They have had to stop taking new customers because they are so in demand now.

563
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,040
But we are getting all our vegetables delivered once a week.

564
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,580
And we ordered some coffee off the internet.

565
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,800
And a man from the roaster came around and dropped the coffee off.

566
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,840
We ordered beer.

567
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,860
And that was bewilderingly actually posted from the warehouse, which is a 20-minute walk from our house.

568
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,580
But that also arrived.

569
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:43,980
And we have been getting takeaway more than usual in a sort of effort to support our local restaurants.

570
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,120
And that has been, again, very efficient.

571
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,380
So we are finding that it is easy to get things brought to us, which is nice.

572
00:40:50,920 --> 00:41:00,700
The thing I found most stressful, not in the first week, but as things went on, was not being able to get an almond croissant or a flat white.

573
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:11,360
And we, after some considerable failure to find anyone who would deliver, we did in fact find someone to deliver these things to us yesterday for vast amounts of money.

574
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,860
But I was very happy.

575
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:19,100
There is a bakery called Hoxton Bakehouse in Southampton that do sourdough bread and lovely pastries.

576
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,980
And they are still delivering also.

577
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,040
So we have been fine on the pastry front.

578
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,060
I also have a local bakery that I frequent quite often.

579
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:33,760
And since they are open and don't normally do deliveries, and so they're trying to very hard to pivot to delivery right now,

580
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:41,740
I have been there a couple of times to do a sort of arm's length by a croissant on my daily exercise walk, which is very nice.

581
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:47,020
And most of the coffee shops will basically send me an iced coffee on a motorbike if I wanted it.

582
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,800
But I have not yet reached that point.

583
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,680
That is fair.

584
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:57,160
We are still allowed out here for exercise once a day, so I've been taking advantage of that to thoroughly explore the streets near my house.

585
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,540
Alison, have you still been going outside regularly?

586
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,360
Are you still driving to a nearby park?

587
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,080
Or are you...

588
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,740
No, no, no.

589
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,220
We've not.

590
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,020
We've not driven.

591
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,620
In fact, I have to...

592
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:11,400
Although it's not one of the approved reasons to go out, I am going to send Stephen in the car for a little drive.

593
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,620
Because we have a car that really will...

594
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,260
The battery will pack in if we don't drive it once in a couple of weeks.

595
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,320
So we are just going to go for a drive and we'll say we're caring for somebody if stopped.

596
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,740
I feel like I have elderly relatives and having a functional car is quite important to us.

597
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,300
And it keeps breaking down.

598
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,240
Oh, no, yeah.

599
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,600
It sounds good.

600
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,900
But otherwise, I haven't been out very much.

601
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,020
We have a garden.

602
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,220
Our garden is more...

603
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,240
It's not really...

604
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,860
I think garden is too strong a word.

605
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,660
We have a patch of scrubland attached to the back of our house.

606
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,020
So that's quite nice.

607
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,520
I mean, you know, just a little one.

608
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:50,780
But it turned out that if you neglect a garden consistently for 20 years, it looks quite neglected.

609
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,220
So we've been out there a bit.

610
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,100
Stephen has been teaching me Tai Chi in the sunshine.

611
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,960
And he says, let's do a warm-up.

612
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,280
And then about five minutes later, I'm like, I've done enough now.

613
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,960
That's fair.

614
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,720
Liz, are you staying healthy?

615
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,700
So I haven't been going out for too many walks.

616
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,220
Partly because I live in a very built-up area with pretty narrow pavements.

617
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,860
So it's quite hard to do any kind of distancing if you run into anyone.

618
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,540
It's also April, which is the hottest month of the year.

619
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,500
And so that's also an attempt to going for a nice walk because it might be 36 degrees outside.

620
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:29,480
I have been carrying on, though, with my doing aerobics in front of YouTube plan.

621
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,940
To the point where I have now found a channel which will do me a six-week exercise plan.

622
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,300
And we'll see if I can do six weeks of indoor YouTube aerobics without going around the bend.

623
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,360
That sounds good.

624
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,420
So we haven't discussed books or TV or video games or anything like that.

625
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:50,720
But we are at the point in time where we have probably talked for enough this week.

626
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,580
So we will get to that next week.

627
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,080
So that was episode two of the Octothorpe podcast.

628
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:01,520
As always, if you have any thoughts, comments, criticisms, wafflings, or other things you'd like to tell us,

629
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:07,960
please give us an email at octothorpecast at gmail.com or tweet with the hashtag Octothorpecast.

630
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,820
And we will mention tweets and emails on future episodes.

631
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,440
But for now, it's goodbye from me.

632
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,680
And goodbye from me.

633
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,000
And goodbye from me.

634
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,780
