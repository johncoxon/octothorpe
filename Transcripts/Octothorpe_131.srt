1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
 uh i'm gonna do this again because i don't know how editable any of what we just did was so

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:24,080
 hello everyone and welcome to the very 131st episode of Octothorpe a podcast for science

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,120
 fiction and science fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 27th of March 2025. I'm

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:39,360
 John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott. And I'm Liz Batty. And this morning with your cup of morning life

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,520
 juice we bring you some letters of comment so we heard from many of you because last week's episode

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,680
 show art was handwriting samples from the three of us and we gave you a hint and the hint was that

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,720
 john has the nicest handwriting and so many of you tried to guess the order of our handwriting

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,200
 tami guessed it when allison liz john and then liz john allison liz allison john was guessed by

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,640
 anginaeel allison john liz was chris karsia's guess rosana said john was in the middle mike

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,240
 scott said allison was in the middle although we think he might be cheating because he probably

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,560
 should know what allison's handwriting looks like uh bidget said mine was the top one and then

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,520
 they're all handwriting fonts and malcom hutchis and also guess that we were using handwriting fonts

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,200
 handwriting fonts are not as good as you think they are guys uh shilah lah said we all have

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,720
 nice handwriting so thank you very much but the winner is the one person to guess correctly uh

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,760
 which is ed mauland who correctly guessed that the order was john allison liz and there was a second

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,480
 hint which is whenever we do anything in order on this podcast we're doing the order john allison

17
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:52,240
 liz so well done ed uh will buy you a point of the beverage of your choice uh easter con awesome

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,440
 other convenient time not if it's whiskey we won't okay yes not the pint whiskey but i was you know

19
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,360
 entertaining non-alcoholic options rather than the pint of vintage champagne option

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,480
 might as a pint of vintage champagne we have checked and ed is down as attending the easter con so

21
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,320
 we are confident that we will be able to procure him a beverage i will also say one other person

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,840
 correctly guessed mine but didn't guess the other two cushila lah said that we all had nice handwriting

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,400
 but said the top one was the nicest hmm so i think that counts so shilah you can have half a pint

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,280
 uh at a future convention of your choice the other person who didn't guess all three of us

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,560
 correctly but guessed me correctly was dug font who basically just said john's at the top and i was

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,520
 like i am so yes thank you dug thank you i was deeply entertained it was very fun to watch the

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,760
 guessing neil harrison was outraged to discover he had no samples of mine nor liz's handwriting

28
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,960
 and i was like well we wrote your christmas card in 2023 so it's not my fault you didn't keep it uh

29
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:02,080
 but yeah hey a christmas cards could be written by a spannier of course no yeah what what i didn't

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,600
 say to neil was but john and a spannier sent me a christmas card this year

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:12,160
 we wrote neil and nick a christmas card and i was going to cycle over to theirs on the

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,280
 i come over the 23rd or 24th of december to drop it off but i messaged them and they were like oh

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,160
 we've already left for christmas and i'm like ah so that christmas cards sat on our window

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,320
 sill for a while before it became clear that it was never going to actually reach near the nick and

35
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,560
 it went in the recycling but near the nick there was a christmas card. Tainingly speaking i suppose

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,160
 we could have saved it for 2025 but that is a level of organization we do not possess we might

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,440
 have digressed but yeah no no i um john occasionally sends me things in the post like random bits of

38
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,360
 ballgames and and he has handwriting that is sufficiently beautiful but when i get it to the

39
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,640
 post i go oh someone with beautiful handwriting has sent me a package and i have always by then

40
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,840
 forget forgot that john said he was going to send me a bunch of leftover bits of video of ballgames

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,120
 so you know i open it to go oh yeah no i know what this is now. The thing i've meant to say about

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,160
 this but forgot is that i may have been grading on a curve because when i said john has lovely

43
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:15,760
 handwriting it is possible that there was a silent for a person of his age and gender hidden in that

44
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:23,840
 i do think that the reason a lot of people assumed it was not in the show order is because a lot of

45
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,640
 people looked at the top handwriting and thought there is no way that is a man's handwriting and i

46
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,560
 i suspect that compounded a great number of people because the only person who guessed john first was

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,480
 the person who guessed all of them correctly yeah and and no one else guessed i was the top

48
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,240
 handwriting and i think i think i have very nice handwriting but uh but i think there is a i think

49
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,040
 you are right that most people assume men do not we are going to be at east con we were going to

50
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,680
 segue from buying a drink uh but that went madly wrong we are planning to have a uh meetup for oct

51
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,040
 thought fans and for people who quite like us but detest walked thought uh and that will be at nine

52
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,960
 p.m. in the bar on friday unless something changes in which case we will publicize it in the east

53
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,680
 con discord and east con newsletter and on our blue sky and facebook meetup also open to people

54
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:24,080
 who love octa thought but detest us i don't know how big that quadrant in the graph is but listeners

55
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,800
 if you think we're all absolute pricks but quite like the audio we make do write in was that another

56
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,360
 gender term of abuse what did i say quite possibly pricks it's all right i can get behind that one

57
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:46,240
 liz uh we will wear our ox thought t-shirts uh i i will wear my octa thought t-shirt i can't

58
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,200
 remember if the other two have an octa thought t-shirt i do not have an octa thought t-shirt but i probably

59
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,680
 can sort something along those lines out before easter now that i think about it when it might be

60
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,640
 that we could in this episode say that easter got octa thought t-shirts are available for sale

61
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,320
 okay god i know who wants to mule me an octa thought t-shirt to beau fast

62
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:15,680
 what size are you liz uh don't know well it depends on what like t-shirt purchasing system

63
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,160
 you're using right yeah yeah yeah no i completely get it do you do you have a favorite t-shirt blank

64
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,080
 no okay so because that would make it easy you could say oh i want to bellow in canvas 3000

65
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,840
 i'm a larger than bellow in canvas 3000 i'd go right that's great i do not know to that detail

66
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,360
 my t-shirt blanks i do know that i have a double in 2019 bid shirt that's quite nice did you make

67
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,640
 those no that will that that'll have been um offworld won't it did you make foley con shirts

68
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,440
 my foley con shirt still fits i can dig it out and look at the size yep that sounds good all right

69
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,120
 i mean i won't necessarily use that shirt blank no because it might not come in purple

70
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,080
 so you want them to be purple and should i put the space people on it because i've really to do

71
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,600
 a shirt with the little space people for a long time and i haven't ever done it i reckon we get

72
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,760
 the actual logo shirts that lori asked for in august and we make those available and then we do

73
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,080
 stretch goals and explore those after i reckon minimum viable product first stretch goals later

74
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,800
 you are you are basically putting work in my diary before easter which is not great because i have

75
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,280
 like in my defense i did put this work in your diary six months ago i am just now nagging i

76
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:37,520
 this is what i'm like now no i mean i in um yes oh in my defense um let me wait till we get to the

77
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,520
 e-base section because jesus fucking christ on the stick oh my god rizanna has written us a letter

78
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,200
 which she says is more of a question than a comment it's very good this is too late for 2025 but i've

79
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,160
 been seeing people talk about nominating tiktoks for the he goes specifically tiktoks not on any sort

80
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,880
 of regular schedule where it's one person and they review and discuss books um i had originally

81
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,640
 assumed these will be fan writer but have been told they ought to be a fan cast because video

82
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,800
 which made sense to me um being kind of like booktube but but on your phone i've now seen tiktokas

83
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,760
 talking themselves talking about it and putting themselves as fan writer however looking at the

84
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,640
 rules they don't really fit in either categories i understand them i may be calling on liz in a

85
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,760
 minute in your collective opinion where would tiktok review folks be nominatable in the he goes and

86
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,800
 where should they be nominatable or see do they just kind of not fit at all um i think as long as

87
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,520
 you've done it at least four times um it's fan cast and it should fit squelient fan cast and if i'm

88
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,440
 wrong liz will tell me because she has a much better understanding of the wiswers constitution

89
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:51,040
 than me um i am a very old person and i am not entirely persuaded that anyone's

90
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,080
 unformed ramblings on video or podcasts really qualify them for fan writer but i accept this

91
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,120
 as me being old and you may have a perfect script and be amazing and at that point maybe

92
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,800
 maybe fan writer would be fine i think it's fair to say that the podcasts i enjoy are definitely

93
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,760
 not written or in general but like shut up and sit down do have like scripts for all their videos

94
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,000
 but i would also say we never nominate dramatic presentations in novel because they have screen

95
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,600
 plays so i am not sure the presence of a script even if it's a very beautifully written script

96
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:34,320
 mmm means that it's fan writing instead of fan casting i mean i i it is possible that i am under

97
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:45,360
 estimating the quality of writing in these book review um tiktoks in which case i am very sorry guys

98
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,800
 um i mean as you may or may not have realized from the last hundred and thirty-one episodes i

99
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,120
 would never personally nominate somebody who's primarily a book reviewer for fan writer because

100
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,480
 that's not what i think fan writing is all about but i understand that i am in arcane arcane

101
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,920
 prehistoric creature in this regard do you mean arcane or archaic archaic by being archaic i'm

102
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,760
 also archaic yeah i mean i wasn't that's why i was like she could mean either plausibly yeah i think

103
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,800
 i think we have to distinguish the actual constitution from vibes so the actual constitution says that

104
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,360
 fan cast is any generally available non-professional audio video periodical devoted to science fiction

105
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,680
 fanciore-related subjects that's had at least one thing in the last kind of D.A. blah blah and that

106
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,880
 seems to me to be tiktoks they say periodical we have it's is well established that periodical

107
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:45,120
 for the purposes of fan cast and fanzine does not require a regular schedule um because many many

108
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,280
 many successful fanzines in particular have have only been periodical in the sense that they've

109
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:58,800
 put a number on the front yeah well i mean that's getting very arcane i mean the same thing is do is

110
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,360
 you know the same thing is true of semi-prozine um and there's semi-prozines that do not appear

111
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,320
 in a regular schedule and to be honest with prosines that do not currently appear on a

112
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,400
 uh regular schedule like you know fanzine science fiction has gone to a very irregular schedule so

113
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,240
 i think periodical does not necessarily ever imply it has to be a regular schedule i mean i'd also say

114
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:26,160
 that fanzine is basically the same as fan cast except we haven't it doesn't say audio video and

115
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,800
 you have to not be a fan cast basically we sort of define fanzine as not being a fan cast in some

116
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,480
 ways yeah and for fan writer it says has to be appeared in semi-prozines or fanzines are in

117
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,360
 generally available electronic media so you would have to classify tiktok as electronic media

118
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,120
 which also doesn't seem like much of a stretch so fan cast but your your actual tiktok is a fan

119
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,200
 cast and it seems exactly the same as the booktubers to me and we've had booktubers on the ballot before

120
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,720
 yeah i stick it in fan cast vibes i'm always going to go for vibes because if we get if

121
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,480
 somebody is a finalist and they and they jib too hard with the vibes of the hugos then

122
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,040
 then a thousand amendments have brought the following year to to get them out again so you know i

123
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:19,680
 agree it's probably a fan cast we heard from far remendelson so just to so far i wrote to us about

124
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:27,440
 the BSFAS charity status and um fower writes in I just want to pick out a couple of things

125
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,240
 from this so basically Fower points out that they won't have to do accruals anymore and I think

126
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,880
 we noted that last time but basically Martin Potts got stuck with the Treasure a role for 16 years

127
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,840
 and now it can be a lot easier and that does seem pretty compelling so Fours says "becoming a

128
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,600
 charitable incorporated organization gives BSFAY members the oversight of the charity commission

129
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
 so they can report the BSFAY if they think something's gone seriously wrong" and basically says

130
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,120
 charities you know make surpluses that stay in the charity and it's clear that BSFay is really a

131
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,480
 charity it's just not registered as one um for a notice noted that it means that the organization

132
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,200
 of the BSFAY will be regularized so Fours says "thank you for your kind words assuming this won't

133
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,400
 make much difference but while things are ticking along very nicely at the moment there have been

134
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,720
 moments where the BSFAY has not been so secure the result is we don't have recorded past decisions

135
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,200
 and meetings it's a shame that no one is around in fandom that could advise on the BSFAY's history

136
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,400
 in a sort of committee role um I've always thought that would be a good idea um but yes this is

137
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,440
 definitely one way to try and make sure that that history is preserved then finally and I think

138
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,080
 this is actually the one I we had not mentioned at all by these probably the best one which is

139
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,640
 if you want to apply for grants being a charity means there are way more grants you can apply for

140
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,280
 and that is oh we had not considered that and that is a that is a smashing point so thank you very

141
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,240
 much FARA. On the subject of FARA's email we heard from listener Alison Scott who pointed out

142
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,800
 camera is not in fact a charity and I regret the error I thought I'd checked but apparently not

143
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,640
 closely enough. I thought it was a membership organization and it used to be but now it's a

144
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,800
 company limited by guarantee because membership being an unincorporated member society is not a

145
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,400
 particularly good long-term strategy for your organization in the UK um and they decided

146
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,280
 that and they were really far too big for it they are a very big campaigning organization but they

147
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,600
 are yes that's absolutely key point that I had not thought of there is a whole world of stuff that

148
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,560
 you might be able to apply for uh which we've probably never in well I don't know if the BSFAY

149
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,040
 was really investigated because they maybe could not. We heard from Christopher J. Garcia who wrote

150
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,880
 in with an appreciation for Robert Pattinson um he says he's a fine though vindictive actor

151
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,760
 and which I like he says basically he he takes roles at a garbage in big films and

152
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,720
 punishes those films by being incredibly dull and annoying and then takes on good roles he cares

153
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,480
 about and does excellent efforts yeah which could be true I mean there's a lot of actors who are like

154
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,520
 I'm gonna do one for my finances and my beach house and then one for the you know the stuff I really

155
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,440
 want to do but I don't think I've actually seen many of the big films that Robin Pattinson is

156
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,760
 possibly dull and annoying and so I will have to hold my judgment on that but I didn't think it was

157
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,080
 great in Mickey 17 which I have now also seen so yeah Chris does say uh that he's the performance

158
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:22,320
 equivalent of hold music which I thought was a statement I've seen Twilight and I thought he was

159
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,320
 all right in it but yeah I think I think Chris might be right about this I do like whenever he

160
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,280
 like doesn't utterly wacky interview because he's presumably bored of being asked the same three

161
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,920
 questions over and over again and just comes up with the whatever stuff he likes I like those uh

162
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,360
 Chris also says he really wants to see Mickey 17 but all his tensions far as films go is

163
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,400
 directed towards time travel is dangerous playing at cinequest tomorrow and I am going to go and

164
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,240
 look up time travel is dangerous and see what it is yay I mean it's a film which we know um

165
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,520
 it's apparently a 24 British comedy mockumentary film which sounds quite good yeah coming to

166
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,760
 cinemas next week apparently hmm UK cinemas on the 28th of March so by the time you get this

167
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,960
 you'll be able to book into it for next weekend for the for the weekend immediate. It does start

168
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,400
 Johnny Vegas who I feel very marmighty about. I even cinero in saying he's very disappointed we

169
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,480
 missed the opportunity to refer to the title change from book to film as taking the mickey

170
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,600
 thank you Ivan correct thank you I taught all. And then we heard from Renee who runs the giant

171
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,000
 Hugo spreadsheet of doom along with the lady business people and Renee is letting us know that

172
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,280
 the 2026 Hugo spreadsheet is open which is great because um means you can go through through the

173
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,240
 year as you read watch listen play good things you can go and put them in the spreadsheet you can

174
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,800
 also go and see things that other people may have thought are good and eligible and read what to play

175
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,920
 them. It will also give you hints if you're not quite sure what category something should go in if

176
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,040
 you put it in there people will generally like leave a message if they think it's in the wrong

177
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,520
 category and so that will help put that in there and yeah the Renee and pals do a great job of

178
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,520
 you know keeping this running and moderating it year after year so I'm very pleased it is open I've

179
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,640
 gone and put a few things in already and I encourage you all to do so not least because if there's

180
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,840
 a thing you really like and you put it in the spreadsheet now when there's like six things

181
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,680
 then I think there's more chance that people might actually see it and read it before nominations

182
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:32,480
 open for 2026. We also heard from Lillian Edwards and Frederick Coulter who I think is a first time

183
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,680
 writer apologies for one Frederick posted on our Facebook group to say he was listening to our

184
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,720
 latest episode and got a message from one of his Canadian friends that they're skipping this

185
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,320
 year for Worldcon because of Trump he was looking forward to meeting them in first in person at his

186
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,520
 first Worldcon in 30 years he wonders if this is going to spread and how it will affect the LA

187
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:03,120
 Worldcon so Ivan Kurt Phillips, Pharah and Doug all posted sort of saying similar things like either

188
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,400
 they know people who were giving a miss or they themselves are giving a miss so and I should say

189
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,960
 here that I have obtained a refund from my attending membership so I we are no longer planning to

190
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,160
 attend either and that is yeah it's sad. So there's also been a statement this week from the Seattle

191
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,920
 Worldcon chair and I think this has been building for a while I've seen other statements other people

192
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,080
 saying elsewhere on blue sky and elsewhere that they think Seattle needs to put out a statement and

193
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,720
 they have and it's basically a statement about how the convention respond to orders and actions of

194
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,160
 the US government that they condemn that create hostile conditions and travel barriers for

195
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,040
 international members and also overall LGBTQ+ members. Basically they're saying that they are

196
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,200
 going to try their best they're listening to everyone they don't have a set of concrete steps

197
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,440
 they're going to take now because probably because there's like not really a satisfactory answer they

198
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,040
 can give I don't think to what they will be able to do and also it's obviously a very fast-moving

199
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,000
 area anything they put down may actually be completely different the situation may be completely

200
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,760
 different in a few months time by the time people are actually thinking of entering for the

201
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,800
 Seattle Worldcon and but they do have a few concrete things they can do which is to recommit to the

202
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,560
 codes of conduct and diversity and anti-racism statements that they do have virtual memberships

203
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,240
 and it sounds like you can done did you downgrade or attending to a virtual? Yeah that isn't mentioned

204
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,760
 in the statement explicitly but I wrote in to see if it was possible and it turned out it was.

205
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,680
 I don't know whether that is I just got lucky or whether that's an official policy or what

206
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,760
 but if you're in a similar position it is worth emailing to find out. I am I'm good to say what I

207
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,480
 always say which is that if you are someone for whom the downgrade from a attending to a virtual is

208
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,200
 not a significant expense for you then you might want to consider retaining your attending membership

209
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,480
 to help the Worldcon which is almost certainly going to find all of this very difficult or of

210
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,440
 course transferring it to somebody else. They've got all of the Chengdu pass along which is loads.

211
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,640
 Yes it's $40,000 so I'm sure it'll help but that's still a relatively small proportion of the

212
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,280
 Worldcon attending and they may they may of course be on the hook for room blocks that they are

213
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,160
 but they've said that they've sold their entire room block already so I think they're probably

214
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,960
 okay yeah room blocks are full room blocks are full and they can't extend them they are having

215
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,560
 trouble like I think there are many things that Seattle Worldcon is struggling with.

216
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,800
 My impression is finance is not one of them but I might be wrong and I don't.

217
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,240
 And they've also put together you know guides to your rights um you know during immigration

218
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,120
 and some non-profit organizations that they are sporting and also end by saying a lot of the Seattle

219
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,160
 staff are also going to be impacted by this and they're also dealing with the impact of other

220
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,800
 buyers natural disasters and you know they're trying and they think it's the start of their

221
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,720
 response and yeah you can email the chair if you have any queries.

222
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,880
 I think there was a statement they really had to put out even though they can't make

223
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,080
 big concrete statements but I think they can say look we're looking at this we're thinking

224
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,080
 about this we are trying to support you through it but I think they are going to be

225
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,760
 quite heavily affected by people changing plans maybe not so much by kind of international

226
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,280
 visitors from Europe and so on but I would bet that there would have been quite a lot of

227
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,280
 Canadian visitors going to Seattle who will now not be willing to enter the US and it

228
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,040
 remains to be seen like how much of an effect does this have on your membership curves do they

229
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,880
 pick up extra virtual members how deeply financially committed are they or do they have a lot of

230
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,680
 wiggle room to to move things around to you know cancel expensive things and so on.

231
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,640
 We do think that the room blocks are filled so if they were on the hook for a certain number of

232
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,800
 room nights they've filled them but I didn't check what like the cancellation policies are on

233
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,240
 whether they could be hit by a potential late cancellation say if things change in a couple of

234
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:03,280
 months. I thought this was a very good statement very very measured very clear in in its condemnation

235
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,800
 of the place we find ourselves in but but but not so clear about what Seattle is going to do better

236
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,080
 but you know there is only so much you can do. To some extent I think conventions especially when

237
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,280
 they are bringing in volunteers who are basically doing things to volunteer for the convention which

238
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,560
 could be otherwise paid work done by people in that country we may have been skating on thin ice

239
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,840
 in some ways for a few years on this and it may just be there now enforcing more strictly

240
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,560
 something which was kind of policy before. Yeah it is unclear if I was going to a US world con I

241
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,400
 would not be volunteering because I would be worried that that would be a problem. I think

242
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,000
 you're probably fine to volunteer once you get there but don't say don't take my word for it.

243
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,200
 For people who are out there saying it's always been like this please note that multiple European

244
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,760
 countries have issued travel advisories to the US now and the UK while it hasn't issued a travel

245
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:12,000
 advisory has changed the long-standing wording in in advice for travelers to the US for basically

246
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,000
 you should expect to meet all entry requirements to the US is enforcing entry requirements strictly

247
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,720
 which is a change and they think there is so clearly our foreign office thinks there's a change

248
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,360
 because there is and I think the best hot take I've seen on this said well of course

249
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,080
 all countries have the right to refuse entry and will refuse entry to anyone who they

250
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,880
 who they think shouldn't enter but there is a very big distinction between refusing entry and

251
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,880
 detaining indefinitely without charge. That's the other that's the terrifying thing and they do not

252
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,240
 have the right under international to do the law to do the second and they are definitely doing it

253
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,880
 in multiple well-documented individual cases where the people while they probably haven't followed

254
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,640
 the letter of the of their entry requirements have not made very major errors you could easily do this

255
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:13,520
 and and there's at least one case where literally the only reason given for detaining a person is

256
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,360
 what they've said on their socials. It's not just people immigrating either there are

257
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,560
 advantage of examples of citizens who had have had visitors visits from the secret service because

258
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:34,000
 of social media posts that were only you know weren't like storm the White House but were mildly

259
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,160
 inflammatory and this is this is a lot right it's obviously a developing situation we are none of

260
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,080
 us are experts we are just doing the sort of talk we might have in the pub but also I'm not going to

261
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:56,640
 the US anytime soon sorry guys love you all. After our last recording we got the little email through

262
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,080
 saying what our schedules were going to be like for reconnect to the Belfast Eastacon which is

263
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,960
 rapidly approaching and I think we all have schedules we are very pleased with you should say these

264
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,120
 are all preliminary and may change because we've just seen kind of our initial program assignments

265
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,240
 but I have clicked yes I'll be on this session to all of them so hopefully I'll be on all of them

266
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,560
 yeah no I'm excited. Killy the most important one is up to top live which will be as traditional

267
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:30,320
 on Monday at 1230 we are down as fan interest and performance guess we're a performance

268
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,360
 be like the last legs are being in the bar before you're to dead dog I think we're a performance

269
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,840
 you're a performance with fan interest I think yeah I think I'd say we're performance before we're

270
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:51,120
 interest. Silly are our live podcasts sir oh that is a hundred percent true well they're live that's

271
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:58,480
 as much as we can say about him they are definitely live yeah and they are plausibly podcasts but no

272
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:06,160
 yeah this will be good so Monday at the time list said 1230 I was a little bit short of time

273
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,560
 and one of the things that happened as I was a little bit short of time was that I unaccountably

274
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:17,840
 forgot to fill in the programming questionnaire with the list of all the panels and then I realized

275
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,120
 that and I thought oh I could I could kind of send them an email saying please please please

276
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,600
 include me despite the fact that I'm a little bit later than I thought on the other hand I could

277
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,520
 just have an Easter card where the only program items I'm on are the fan funds auction which is

278
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,360
 going to be on Sunday evening and then also I'm on opt to thought live along with you guys I guess

279
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:48,720
 the things I am on at Eastercon I am on a little thing called octor blive with allison and liz at

280
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,600
 1230 on Monday I'm on fandom politics and boycotts whereas the line in how do we draw it with Liz

281
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,360

283
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,760
 to be moderating two other panels on the sunday so I have is the force with you at 1230 on sunday

284
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,280
 I'm moderating that with a pretty great selection of panelists so I got Rebecca Rowanhorse Russell

285
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,320
 Smith Jonathan Laidlow and David Green and then I've got what does this card really mean history

286
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,680
 in board games which is Russell Smith Tim Kirk Estemma Callum Stewart and Ian Moore so I those are

287
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,120
 both things I think I've said everything I want to say about Star Wars at Eastercons for the

288
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,080
 civil future but I'm very happy to encourage other people to say interesting things about Star Wars

289
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,720
 and I don't know much about history in board games but by jov I know about board games and I will

290
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,520
 be asking insightful questions of an insightful panel so I'm looking forward to that too I'm on

291
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,440
 the aforementioned Oxford Up Live on Monday and on Sunday I'm on fandom politics and boycotts as

292
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,040
 mentioned previously with one jion cox and some other great panelists and also on Saturday afternoon

293
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:10,640
 I will be giving the hey lecture yeah whoa oh that's fabulous yes I am very excited and also very

294
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,680
 nervous and I don't know why so come along and smile and make reassuring faces at me oh that's

295
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:25,600
 so good no richly deserved and I'm excited to attend but yeah it was good be great very excited

296
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,200
 also there's anything you particularly want to know I mean in my specialist field of like holding

297
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,760
 up sequencing of pathogens then let me know and I might put it in the talk because I haven't written

298
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,480
 it yet bae I assume you're gonna write it on the plane to Belfast in the accepted manner of academics

299
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,040
 no I'm gonna write it well in advance because that's how I roll hey no it is strange if I was

300
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,560
 giving an academic talk then yeah I might write it like two or three days ahead unless they were

301
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,440
 doing that thing where they like your slides 10 days ahead or whatever in which case I'd write

302
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,520
 it 10 days ahead if I'm just on a panel you know fine I will just prep the panel but for some reason

303
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:08,640
 doing an academic talk to Eastacom people means I'm gonna be like preparing way way in advance yeah

304
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,440
 it's weird it's a particular thing isn't it condensing your academic expertise in a way that is

305
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:25,680
 understandable to non-expert but generally bright and extremely picky people not not wanting to

306
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:31,920
 trouble you yeah but I'm not I'm not that nervous about explaining it to like non-experts usually

307
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,120
 but for some reason specifically Eastacom experts or efficient convention non-expert is

308
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,320
 more nerve-racking than a while it's terrifying it's fair thanks John I think it's because I've

309
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,640
 seen like 20 years of hay lectures and they've all been really good so you will not be the one

310
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,360
 to break the duck do not um no you'll be great I'm very excited about this so if anyone's

311
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,120
 disappointed by my saying I will not be available on panels at Eastacom I it gives me more time to

312
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,720
 be available in the bar so I will see you all there I don't know which bar there may be more than one

313
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,200
 bar we may have to specify which bar we're gonna be in okay that's the point okay and then um

314
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,600
 I'm looking forward to Eastacom it's gonna be great I'm looking forward to Liz's hay lecture

315
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,840
 those items do all sound great so if every world's items are as good as that it's going to be a

316
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,080
 fabulous program well I think they're all going to be good and I know that because I signed in and

317
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,120
 clicked on the ones I'd like to be part of and so I looked at them all so yeah relatively little

318
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,200
 where I felt like I had like one of the reasons I'm moderating to is because I was like well that's

319
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,640
 a very interesting topic which I think I could moderate but I'm not sure I have anything interesting

320
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:50,400
 to say about congratulations to Meg and David who are the co-leads of program and I've done a

321
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,760
 cracking job ably assisted I believe by a couple in sharp and D Franklin well do you want to talk

322
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,960
 about so the other thing that none of us are officially on but which we will probably be trying to

323
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,680
 attend is the launch of color fields writing about writing about science fiction by pork and

324
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:18,640
 cade and yeah I am excited about about this I'm excited sounds great that does also sound like

325
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,040
 a good thing to go to I mean I'm sure there's gonna be lots of lovely things to go to Eastacom

326
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,280
 I'm really looking forward to it at this point I have a I have a kind of three-week spell in my life

327
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:36,160
 which has is continuing continually has house guests fleeing America sorry house guests from

328
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:42,880
 America and core flu and then different house guests from America and then Eastacom in it and

329
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,760
 I'm very much looking forward to all of this but my um but I'm slightly worried about my health

330
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,560
 and and deliver in particular so I have a lot of things that I have to have done before that

331
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:05,600
 first house gets to arrive so yay yeah you got makeup to look t-shirts yes I do have to make

332
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,240
 optical t-shirts available for sale which I will definitely

333
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,760
 we've just heard in the last couple of days that the person who for many years was Britain's oldest

334
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,440
 active science fiction fan Peter maybe passed away peacefully in his sleep a couple of weeks ago

335
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,800
 there's a post from his great niece on his facebook feed um Peter was the first winner of

336
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:39,920
 the Doc Wear award in 1963 and I think when we talk about the sorts of people we think win the

337
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:46,240
 Doc Wear award um um Peter really exemplified that because all of his work on fan on

338
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,200
 fanish things was well behind the scenes and also really quite a long time ago because you know

339
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,160
 he was he was quite old he was 98 he was one of the first members of the Cheltenham Circle and the BSA

340
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:04,480
 um he acted as the librarian of the BSA lending library and then was a BSA committee member

341
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,120
 it was also one of the founders of the Order of St. Fantany which is something that we don't talk

342
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,040
 about very much um on the podcast because it doesn't exist it doesn't really exist anymore

343
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,080
 he was presented in his absence with the first Doc Wear award at the 1963 EasterCon

344
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,280
 bull con and was a member of the organizing committee for long con 2 and was responsible for

345
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:31,280
 the long con 2 publications he carried on going to EasterCon and Novacons well into his 90s and I

346
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,760
 used to chat with him there I found him very good company um I missed those conversations

347
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,760
 yeah I didn't have anything to add because I didn't I did really chat to him

348
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,560
 neither of you actually knew him right I mean I knew him by sight but I don't think we'd really

349
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,360
 had many conversations before he stopped being able to attend conventions yeah fair

350
00:33:49,360 --> 00:34:01,680
 the BSA award finalists were announced a few weeks ago we covered the long lists and they have

351
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,800
 now been narrowed down to shortlist by members of the BSA and members of the BSA and members of

352
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:13,360
 EasterCon will be able to vote on the winners so we're going to put a link in the show notes to

353
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,720
 all the different finalists you remember that the BSA awards now has quite a lot more categories

354
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,440
 than it used to I mean there we used when we've had like three categories but now it is up to

355
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:31,440
 nine I feel like it was four for a very long time yeah but they do look like pretty

356
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,720
 great short lists especially in the the nonfiction so they split nonfiction into short nonfiction

357
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,320
 and long nonfiction and so the long nonfiction is basically a set of interesting looking books

358
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,640
 including ones by Paul King Cade on Prevent by Keith Roberts by Paul Marshall on J.D. Ballard's

359
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,960
 Crash John Clute's book The Book Blinders which is what he gave his lecture on last year at

360
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,480
 EasterCon uh spec for Nuby's volume two I think Effect Effect VNuby's volume one did it win a

361
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,800
 BSA award or was nominated for one and of course Track Changes by Abigail Nussbaum from Bridene

362
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,200
 Books yeah so that's a really good shortlist and then the short nonfiction has like seven

363
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,320
 interesting interesting essays not all of which I have read yet but includes the one by Ted Chiang

364
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,840
 on AI that was going around a lot last year on Bailie's book about considering Cozy science

365
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:28,240
 fiction fantasy ones by Eugene Bacon and Estee Grunavagan and the Hugo Award Report from

366
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,680
 Chris Bowerclay and Jason Sanford so yeah they're all basically pretty solid

367
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,000
 shortlist I will not read them all out but you can now go and take a look and a lot of the short

368
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,840
 fiction and shorter fiction is online and so you can have a read of those as well I will say

369
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:51,040
 that a lot of the categories have not the five nominees as specified in the Constitution but

370
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,280
 they have gone to either four nominees or you know six or seven presumably because of ties in

371
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,760
 the voting for the shortlist which does suggest there might have been like a very

372
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:10,480
 widespread of votes across you know from maybe a fairly small voting pool across a wide number of

373
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,040
 items which may indicate that not a lot of BSA members voted so I guess we have to see maybe

374
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,000
 having this many categories meant the people didn't feel they were qualified to vote on some

375
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,920
 of them and so didn't but also we always know that if you have short fiction then you get like a

376
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,760
 very long tale of you know if you look at the Hugo Short story you always get a very long tale of

377
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,120
 nominees and that occasion has gone down to different numbers as well so there's a big thing that

378
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,640
 happens it's strange that they have only four novels there well presumably because it was either

379
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:48,880
 four or eighteen so we have unfortunately the BSA Awards are not yet listed on the BSA website

380
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,840
 so we've linked to the file 770 summary of the awards and we will let everyone know when it's

381
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:09,920
 on the BSA's website. Do we want to talk about F now? Yes. Who wants to introduce that?

382
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:16,800
 So the European Fan Fund transports European SF fans to conventions and there is going to be a

383
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:25,280
 race to send a fan to Archipelicon which is Euricon 2025 in Mariam in the Aland Islands in June.

384
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,520
 Open to any European fan living outside Finland, Bulgaria and Poland.

385
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,640
 Nominations for the EFF have been extended and they now close on the 30th of March so if you're

386
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,640
 thinking about standing or know someone who you think should stand then do nominate them.

387
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,840
 Yeah we think the European Fan Fund does a good thing and we recommend that you will vote in it.

388
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,360
 Hmm I shall vote enthusiastically. I'm very excited about going to Archipelicon so this seems

389
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:59,440
 like a good thing to win. There is also going to be a Fan Fund auction at Eastercon and that is

390
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,000
 currently scheduled for Sunday at 8pm. If you were thinking of bringing something lovely to auction

391
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,280
 in the fan funds then we have made a statement about this in the progress report which is basically

392
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,160
 please only bring small light things and please tell us in advance if you're bringing them

393
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,520
 because we are all flying and we don't really want to end up with somebody bringing in 30 kilos of

394
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,880
 un-unfor-sorted paperback science fiction books or anything like that because we will not be able to

395
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,880
 sell them or indeed give them away. We don't have a table, just small light valuable things

396
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,680
 and let us know that you're planning to bring them so that we can say oh that's lovely please

397
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,520
 save it for next year. So our only action this year is that we're going to have an auction,

398
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,240
 we're going to have about 50 things in it, we already know about what 30 or 35 of them are so

399
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,560
 there's not that much space but you know if you have something amazing do absolutely let us know.

400
00:38:52,560 --> 00:39:00,320
 So basically please bring small light valuable items to Eastercon and hand them all to Alison.

401
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,640
 Yeah yeah if you've got any emeralds Alison has said she collects emeralds as well.

402
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,960
 If you've got first edition boxes of Dungeons and Dragons do let me know

403
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,280
 which is like emeralds in terms of their size to weight to value ratio.

404
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,040
 Alison teased me by saying she might have a lot of white dwarfs she couldn't sell because they'd

405
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,880
 had the Dave Langford's columns clipped out and would I like them for free and I was like well

406
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,400
 yes I would but I suspect they're still worth things so maybe that's a bit cheeky and then it

407
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,240
 turned out that they hadn't had the columns clipped out so they are still worth massive

408
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,800
 longer and therefore I am not having them for free because I don't think those ones are I mean

409
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,640
 the very first issues which I do have to sell them will be going on to Facebook,

410
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,400
 can't be a quite soon, are worth massive amounts of longer but by the time you get to the one's

411
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,720
 with Dave Langford's columns in they're down to about £10 on issue which you know isn't that

412
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,200
 amount of money but you know four old magazines is pretty solid let me tell you.

413
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,600
 And just because Alison didn't mention it those eBay auctions are for the fan funds with the proceeds

414
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:08,400
 going to Guff F and the Corfloo fan fund. Also one of my buyers has got his stuff and wrote to be

415
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,280
 saying one of the things you sold me used to belong to Dave Langford, can I ask how you came by it

416
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,240
 in a kind of are you thieving where I'm like oh shit maybe I should have been putting this in the

417
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:27,120
 listings which I did think about but oh that's actually a good point because Dave is famous

418
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:34,320
 and not everyone knows he goes to the pub. Yeah he's famous to the exact people who are buying

419
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,840
 this stuff so maybe that would have been an idea but it feels a bit odd to say I'm here selling

420
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,880
 Dave Langford's file copies you know even though that is what I'm doing. I think you could put a

421
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,800
 little label on I'm saying from the library of Dave Langford on your eBay auctions and you might

422
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,520
 get an extra quid. Well and also you might what you might also not get is people assuming you've

423
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,800
 nicked him so in my make your life a lot easier in the long run anyway. Indeed I mean I have been

424
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,120
 kind of telling people what they're for but not obviously I don't put in the listings that the

425
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,560
 money's going to things that aren't charities that are like charities for lots of reasons.

426
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,080
 Another reason if we if the fanfons were charity or if the science fiction is like a pedia is a

427
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:22,240
 charity we could actually be managing that through eBay in a way that would almost certainly increase

428
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,400
 the amount but I'm not I'm not taking bids anywhere they're all on buy it now for what I think they're

429
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,080
 probably so full and I'm being careful here to say to not say what I think they're worth because you

430
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:38,000
 know some people have more bodies in the sense. I'm mentioning it on the podcast as well because

431
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,120
 you might be if you're one of our older listeners you might have a box of elderly

432
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,960
 Dungeons and Dragons stuff in your attic. It was a very it was a big craze in British science fiction

433
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,440
 fandom in 1975 and 1976 probably also an American science fiction fandom in 1975 and 1996 and that

434
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,760
 was a very good time to have got into something lost interest and then put it away in a box for 50

435
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,120
 years let me tell you. So if you have those things either use them or give them somebody who'll use

436
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,080
 them or sell them or if you're going to do none of those things write a note on the box in a sharp

437
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:23,280
 you're saying do not throw this away when I die without checking the solve process first.

438
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:30,560
 And then then picks I think we're pivoting to a Rosanna Pendelbury fan podcast and we will see

439
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:37,120
 why that is over the course of these picks but I am going to pick The Power Fantasy by Kieran Gillan

440
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:44,480
 Casper-Wynyard Clayton Cowles and Brian Hughes that's it's really good. So I haven't been talking

441
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,480
 about this because I wasn't sure whether it was technically eligible for a Hugo last year or this

442
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:58,720
 year but the trade paperback came out at the start of this year and I think I think therefore

443
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,600
 it will be eligible next year but I will be enthusiastically nominating it when that comes up.

444
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,520
 This is kind of there's a couple of different ways you can think about it it's kind of an

445
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,920
 exploration of what the X-Men would be like in a more realistic setting or it's what watchmen would

446
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,440
 be like if there were six Doctor Man Hattens instead of just one and all of them were angry at each other

447
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,800
 in that way that families often are. It is very powerful it's very intriguing I don't know what's

448
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:35,200
 going to happen it's kind of about Brinksmanship and about how difficult it is for entities with

449
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,160
 extreme power to interact with one another without destroying each other and it's just really good.

450
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:50,720
 The art is amazing the writing is excellent and yeah just really really enjoying it and it's

451
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,680
 as I say the first trade is out now it collects the first five issues I think you can get it

452
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,280
 of like a tenor which is ridiculously cheap but I've been reading it in singles and it's just

453
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,520
 it's amazing so so yeah I would enthusiastically recommend going and looking that up and jumping

454
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,760
 on the individual issues because the backs of the issues are very funny and I don't think they're

455
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,960
 going to be collected in the trades so yeah. Please send me screenshots. I like that you think I

456
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,440
 don't buy them as like physical comics one of course I do buy them as physical comics. Please send me

457
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,520
 photos which are just like you know generalised screenshots. Hmm right and Rosanna Pendlebury

458
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,240
 has written a lovely review of this at Nerds of a Feather which I have linked in the show notes and

459
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,000
 it's very good she describes it as what if your cold world was six people each with superpowers

460
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,680
 the equivalent to a nuclear arsenal and what if each of them was a total mess of a person? So my pick

461
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,640
 this week is The Tomb of Dragons by Katherine Addison which is the final installment for now

462
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,280
 of the Cemeteries of Amalot Religee. I think I've picked the second one on this podcast before

463
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:06,080
 so it is another kind of mystery novel with Farah Salahar a priest who can speak with the dead

464
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,920
 although at the start of this book, spoiler said previous book, he has lost that power and is

465
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:19,920
 essentially just kind of a very it's not cozy well it kind of is cozy in that solving these

466
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,400
 problems tends to involve Salahar going around and drinking a lot of tea and walking around places

467
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,960
 and many times having to have someone show him where to walk around places and then having some

468
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,800
 more tea and then having some more conversations and in that way it's very cozy but kind of the

469
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,880
 background world is a little less cozy and you know it's it's clear that a lot of the time he is

470
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,120
 trying to you know work against the wrongs of society and so the first two I greatly enjoyed

471
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,400
 the third one I did enjoy maybe not quite as much though and that's partly because of the way it

472
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,480
 intersects with Addison's previous book The Goblin Emperor in that The Goblin Emperor,

473
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,880
 the Emperor does reappear in this book and so it feels a bit too much like a sort of the Emperor

474
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,440
 comes in and by fiat can do things because he is the Emperor and it sort of reminds you that

475
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,760
 this is what happens in worlds where you have an Emperor this is just that we happen to have a

476
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,400
 good Emperor in this world at the moment and so like when he turns up it feels a bit like the

477
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,680
 super powered character from somewhere else coming in to fix things so there's some aspects of like

478
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:25,520
 how that is resolved that I didn't quite enjoy and I do think it was getting a little repetitive

479
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,720
 with the second book like there is still a lot of tea drinking in all the books and a lot of

480
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,120
 wandering around but there is like a scene which is unfortunately almost kind of word for word the

481
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,440
 same as from a previous book but where they're trying to kind of persuade Salahah that actually

482
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,880
 he does have friends and he can lean on them and they would like to be his friends and he needs to

483
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,640
 kind of accept that he can sometimes have friends and lean on them I think one of the

484
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,520
 main relationships comes to a very nice conclusion around that I don't want to give too much away

485
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,080
 but I felt that worked and quite a lot of it works it's just I feel that some of the some of the

486
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,960
 kind of how things get resolved is less satisfactory than it could be. Volimately I think it's very

487
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,720
 satisfying trilogy and so it's probably an early front one of one of my best series nominations in

488
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,200
 2026 and much like John references a very nice review of The Power Fantasy by Rosanna Pendleberry

489
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,360
 at Nozefether I'm going to reference a very nice review of The Tomb of Dragons by Rosanna

490
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,320
 Pendleberry at Nozefether which also manages to capture most of the things I felt about this book

491
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,160
 so I think what we're saying is we should maybe just give up on picks and you should just go and

492
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,040
 read Nozefether. Yep I believe Rosanna has also done some writing for Strange Horizons so you could

493
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:37,280
 go and check them out too. I'm just checking that Rosanna hasn't reviewed my pick which I do not

494
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,360
 think she has Rosanna if you're listening to this and you have reviewed my pick. How dare you Alison?

495
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:52,720
 Please send us a link. I am picking The Death of Stalin which is a film by Amanda Inuchy which is

496
00:47:52,720 --> 00:48:00,960
 remarkably accurate on the actual events surrounding Stalin's death and remarkably inaccurate

497
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:08,400
 on the dialogue which we cannot of course know that people spoke around that death but it is the

498
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,320
 blackest black comedy of all time and it's currently on BBC iPlay you'd almost think that

499
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:22,000
 they thought it was timely because it's what happens if you have an aging extremely powerful

500
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:35,200
 and completely mad ruler who has been having purges and what happens when that person dies

501
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:43,760
 and the people who have surrounded him who have all changed their behaviour to support him in his

502
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:51,360
 madness have to decide what to do and it is extremely funny but it is much darker than Inuchy's

503
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,440
 other work which if you've seen some of Inuchy's other work you might think there wasn't really

504
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,480
 very much darker for it to get so yeah it's fantastic everyone should watch it and if you're

505
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,800
 in the UK you can watch it at the moment because it's on BBC iPlay, fantastic film and Jason Isaacs

506
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,120
 who is in general a very very very fine actor is it absolutely knocks this one out of the park

507
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:18,000
 and if you had to criticise the film which is quite hard to do the big criticism would be as a

508
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,800
 result of historical events Jason Isaacs does not turn up until halfway through the film which is

509
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:30,160
 a great shame Jason Isaacs is the only actor to have ever played Tobes which could leave that

510
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,960
 there without further explanation oh no no no no no no no no you are not leaving that there with

511
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:41,280
 that further explanation no you know you know you know you cannot i believe i'm Tobes did explain

512
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:48,800
 this to me so basically Tobes was used as a character in a Robert Rankin novel and Jason Isaacs

513
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:56,640
 played that character in the dramatisation of the novel oh like an audio dramatisation

514
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,880
 yeah like they did like a dramatised reading of it for the audiobook and he really has Tobes

515
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:10,400
 to Valwa yep oh my god right well that's gonna be my pick next time wow i know right

516
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:20,720
 the Brighton Lomicon in he is in episode e12 d13 of the Brighton Lomicon playing Tobes to Valwa

517
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,840
 Tobes i mean i think this is like amazing right absolutely amazing yeah Tobes is justifiably

518
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:35,840
 extremely proud of this as he should be i mean that is that is the best you know because who wouldn't

519
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:42,640
 want to be portrayed by Jason Isaacs really yep oh my god okay we need we need to find a clip of

520
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,320
 this because i need to see if Jason Isaacs really catches the essence of Tobes in his portrayal

521
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:54,000
 is at the end of the episode i feel like i felt like that was a bit of a show stopper wasn't it

522
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:09,920
 and that was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye for me it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

523
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,840
 Friday would work because then people know what we look like for the rest of the con and have met

524
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:29,360
 us i feel like Friday's a good time all right Friday the mum all right so there is a risk that

525
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,400
 there'll be something amazing on the program and we'll find ourselves up against a life-changing

526
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,720
 program item should we say nine o'clock there won't be a life-changing program item at nine o'clock

527
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:46,080
 on Friday will there i'm not in Belfast until like nine thirty so on Friday yeah oh okay so maybe

528
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:52,160
 Friday evening is Friday evening really difficult then are you gonna want to get to the con oh well

529
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:58,960
 you didn't specify the am or the pm oh no i'm not meeting people at about nine am john god nine p.m

530
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:09,120
 idiot boy honestly hook line and singer okay uh yeah nine pm on friday sounds like a lovely idea

531
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:15,840
