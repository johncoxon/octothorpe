00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 Please note, we have recused ourselves from consideration for the 2025 Hugo's In the

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,160
 Category of Best Fancast.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:24,160
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 129th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,760
 Science Fiction and Science Fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 27th of February 2025.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,440
 I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and we have some letters of comment.

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,800
 They're not very many. We heard from DC on Blue Sky, some comments on the follow-up to our

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,200
 follow-up. DC says that Prisma Dec or Blind Chance, the Polish sliding-doors version film we talked

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,960
 about the other week, is available on DVD and Blu-ray. So that's our jungle watch it but

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,560
 apparently you should on no account read the back of the box on account of it having a big

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,240
 spoiler on the back. Yeah there's a film that's been in the cinemas recently that I didn't

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,360
 quite manage to see where there was a spoiler on the, a massive spoiler for the big reveal on the

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,160
 poster. It's, it's 24 quid. There are so many movies that I don't have to spend 24 quid to watch.

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,160
 Well this is just a sign of the fact that we've all basically become accustomed to having lots and

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,840
 lots of stuff on streaming, more stuff they can ever possibly watch except it means that classics

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,880
 of Polish cinema are now only available if you buy the Blu-ray for 24 quid, which is a kind of

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,920
 sad indictment of streaming media. What I would say DC is you should arrange a screening of this

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,000
 at a convention. Oh we used to do that. Yeah. DC also mentions that the day our last episode was

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
 released, Agent Tchaikovsky was on a UK political podcast called The Bunker discussing whether

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,320
 politicians should read science fiction and it's apparently it's a 13th February episode. Have I

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,080
 listened to this yet? I have not. Do I think politicians should read science fiction?

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:07,280
 Mean if they fancy? That. Yeah. DC also calls us due to typo "octothorope", which I also quite like.

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,320
 Fair enough. And finally DC asks why on Octop 128 John felt he maybe shouldn't pick a book?

23
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,080
 So I don't know if I said, I don't know exactly what I said, but I can't pick a book because I've

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,920
 been reading for the Clark and I can't pick any of the books I'm reading for the Clark.

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,760
 Here's why. I'd also now Liz and I can't pick anything that is eligible for the Hugo

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,240
 so anything from last year and all of the books I'm reading are books from last year

27
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,480
 and I can't talk about them for two reasons. It's only going to be a few months though.

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
 Yeah, then I'll be able to pick things again. And meanwhile I can pick books from last year.

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,880
 So because I am not I'm not reading for the Clark or in the I am in the Hugo team but not in this

30
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,600
 bit of it. I have no knowledge of the nominations. We also heard from Farah Mendelsohn who says

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,920
 "thank you for picking up that the word written is in the definition of the non-fiction

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,680
 categories" that is a mistake and they are going to get it sorted for us. Thank you for

33
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:14,080
 Farah. I say for us for truth and justice and the BSFA way. But yes. So the reason we were confused

34
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,200
 was it was a confusion and it's not just because we weren't paying attention properly, which is good.

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,160
 Not always the case. Thank you very much Farah.

36
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,400
 Doug Faunt wrote to us a subject dear to my heart and said "some media just flaked,

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,720
 not all real stand up to time. I discarded some real to real tapes because there was a lot of

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,920
 brown dust in the boxes. All tapes should be archived to other media. That is completely true.

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,320
 But also tapes are plastics and plastics have a tendency to collapse over time

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,680
 for certain plastics. Somebody said to Vraupton tells which things collapse and which things

41
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,200
 don't. He gave away his media just recorder in the player when they were still popular."

42
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,960
 Thank you very much for writing in Doug.

43
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,920
 Do we want to recreate Chris Garcia's recreation of him and Bella and JP listening to

44
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,360
 Altsop?

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,800
 Yes. Who wants to play Bella? Who wants to play Chris and who wants to play JP? I will play Chris.

46
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,840
 I will play Bella.

47
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
 That means Alison's JP.

48
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
 Yeah. Okay. Do you want to introduce it, John?

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
 So we heard from Christopher J. Garcia who wrote in with a dramatic, well,

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,320
 wrote in for a script for a dramatic presentation of Bella JP and Chris Garcia listening to Oct

51
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:36,640
 thought waiting for school to open. Oh, key dokey. So I think Bella starts and ends the scene.

52
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,560
 This chai is still too hot. Blow on it and stir.

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,760
 Does John Cox win right science fiction?

54
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,280
 Coxon and yes under the pen name John Scalsy.

55
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,080
 You're lying, Papa. We've met Scalsy.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,600
 You've met actor Will Wheaton playing the character John Scalsy.

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
 Coxon likes his privacy.

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,080
 Cox Wayne.

59
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,960
 Coxon.

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,560
 Sure, Papa. You have no credibility and NC.

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,840
 Okay. I just want to state for the record that the word

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,080
 C-O-X-S-W-A-I-N is pronounced Coxon and I was forced to pronounce it incorrectly

63
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,840
 so that the dialogue would work.

64
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
 We thank you for your method acting.

65
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
 Yes.

66
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,760
 It doesn't surprise me somehow that Chris Garcia says he is a fanatic for brutalism.

67
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,200
 But he can only watch so long a film between all the wrestling he needs to see.

68
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,560
 So it may have to wait a bit.

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,960
 Yeah, I think probably he can watch it later on streaming and do six other things at the

70
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,160
 same time. So he doesn't need to actually watch all the bits where it's lovingly panning over

71
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,600
 architecture which are considerable.

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,400
 The only thing to know obviously is that if it never comes out on streaming and only comes out

73
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
 as a Â£24 blue-ray.

74
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,680
 It's a bleeding Oscar nominally. It's bound to come out.

75
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,360
 It was a sort of joke, you see.

76
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
 I've never been very good at them myself but I've heard they can be politically effective.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,720
 We should maybe try one or two sometimes.

78
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
 On the podcast.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,720
 And that was letters of comment.

80
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,480
 Is that literally all we got?

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,560
 We should try being more interesting.

82
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,040
 No, we don't need to be more interesting.

83
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,960
 We need to be more contentious.

84
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,920
 Oh no.

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,120
 See what you're making us do listeners and by us I mean Alison.

86
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,560
 Yes.

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,920
 Thanks to everyone who wrote in and everyone who will write in in the future.

88
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:36,400
 We have some brief news about the Belfast Easticon.

89
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,400
 So firstly PR4 is almost ready so keep your eyes peeled for that because I suspect it will

90
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,040
 wing its way to you before the next episode listeners.

91
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,560
 Excuse me.

92
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,200
 Before the next episode listeners and we will discuss it when it does.

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,480
 But also the programme is currently going into Plan Z.

94
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,880
 If you're planning to volunteer to be on programme keep your eyes peeled on your emails.

95
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,640
 Because that is where the news will be.

96
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,840
 I think that do you mean if you've volunteered to be on programme

97
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,480
 because are they going to take new volunteers at the stage or?

98
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,040
 Well but this is the indication of interest point right where you go through the panels

99
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,480
 and put your name down.

100
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,080
 And remember the lessons we learned from doing this for World Cons which is

101
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,480
 don't tell yourself short.

102
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,360
 Yes.

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,000
 You can put yourself down for stuff because if you don't put yourself down for things

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,440
 someone with less imposter syndrome probably put themselves down for it.

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
 Indeed.

106
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,760
 And then you will find yourself at the convention sitting in the audience going

107
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,680
 why have they put this idiot on the programme when I know so much more about the topic than they do

108
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,960
 and that'll be the answer.

109
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,760
 Yes.

110
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,960
 Well it might or might.

111
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,320
 It'll sometimes be the answer.

112
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:56,000
 Yes there has been a report that people trying to cancel their rooms with the Hilton

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,840
 who went for a non-refundable room are not able to get a refund which is not enormously

114
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,600
 surprising but in fact they're not being able to get a refund for the entire stay

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,240
 rather than the much more normal practice of charging you for the first night.

116
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,560
 And this is new.

117
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,040
 So if this is happening to you that I'm very sorry,

118
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,160
 the suggestion at the moment is that you use something like the Eastacom Facebook group to find

119
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,240
 somebody else who wanted the room that you are on the hook for at the moment because obviously

120
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,040
 there will still be people looking for rooms at the moment.

121
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:39,520
 So it does seem a bit harsh of the Hilton and I think I'm going to do a shout out to Phil Dyson

122
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,400
 to watch for this in next year's contract because they are not there also with the Hilton.

123
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,120
 To be fair there are two reports.

124
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,280
 There's one from someone saying that they tried to call and book and they were trying to be

125
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,560
 charged the entire room rate and someone saying they will cancel it and are being charged for one

126
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
 night's stay.

127
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,960
 So it might just be a mistake and it may have been sorted out by the time you listen to this.

128
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,600
 The first comment was that they've waved the additional because Nick Whitehead who is the reporter

129
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,720
 booked early and they've let them cancel on health grounds so they've charged the deposit but not

130
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,760
 the other or they've charged one night but not the other three but that sounds like a

131
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,200
 exception has been made because it's a disability issue.

132
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,640
 So it doesn't sound like it's a mistake of it doesn't sound like it's differently

133
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,760
 applying the same policy.

134
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,240
 It sounds like differently applying two different policies to me but maybe I am wrong.

135
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
 I do not work for the Hilton.

136
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,480
 It's not clear to me whether they have like waved it on health grounds or whether they've gone for

137
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,720
 what the booking conditions actually say when you book.

138
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,520
 Okay.

139
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,760
 We need more data points I think.

140
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
 So but it, right.

141
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,840
 So but the one that Cheryl Arvits and Keating is trying to cancel they say the terms of the

142
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,120
 booking were that it would mean that you didn't get a refund if you cancelled.

143
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,960
 So it sounds to me like the non-refundable hotel room turned out to be non-refundable.

144
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,040
 Assuming they booked on the con rate I posted in Discord where it says when you try and book

145
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,800
 a hotel with the con rate which is that it will keep a one night deposit.

146
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,720
 But it's not clear to me that they did book at the con rate.

147
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,120
 So in the UK if you book a hotel you can check out early at which point you do not

148
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,360
 normally have a further liability.

149
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,160
 So this is Hilton trying to stretch what can be done under normal custom and practice for UK hotels.

150
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,560
 It might be legal but it is a huge stretch to charge one more than one night.

151
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,200
 Oh also it's daft because the hotel will be full.

152
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,840
 So what they're probably going to do now is resell this but not actually refund the original person.

153
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,640
 But yes agreed but when I go on hotels.com and book a non-refundable hotel room

154
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,400
 I do that on the basis that if I need to cancel it I won't get a refund because that's what

155
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,280
 non-refundable means. If I book a plane ticket that's non-refundable and I have to cancel I'm out

156
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,560
 the cost of the plane ticket. If I book a train ticket that's non-refundable I guess I'm struggling

157
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,360
 to see it's non-refundable. That means it-

158
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,840
 Yeah I think the issue is that the Hilton normally do a whole bundle of different things right?

159
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,880
 You can do completely flexible or medium flexible or completely non-refundable.

160
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,240
 But if you book on the con rate there's only one option.

161
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
 It sounds like this person must not have booked on the con rate then because they say

162
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,680
 he was unable to help which is fair enough because that was the terms of the booking.

163
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,040
 At the point where the person making the booking is like fair enough that was the terms of the booking.

164
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,200
 Am I angry? Like they read the terms understood the terms and the terms have been upheld.

165
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,720
 Like I mean it's shitty I'd much rather get my money back if I had to cancel

166
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,360
 and my heart goes out to this person who has had to cancel because I must suck.

167
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,440
 But also if a business says that if you give the money they're not going to give it back.

168
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,480
 Do you see what I mean? I don't know.

169
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,960
 Yeah it's tricky because I think there's two things. So one it's not clear what- whether this

170
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,040
 person has used the con rate. If you had I think you'd just pay one night and so then I guess the

171
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,640
 thing would be do they then try and charge the rest of your card which would be a bit naughty

172
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,120
 under what I would- how I would interpret the con in terms and conditions or have they accidentally

173
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,080
 booked under another rate which was totally non refundable in which case yeah fair enough

174
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,880
 transferring it is a reasonable solution there. And then we have someone else who did appear to book

175
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,320
 on the con rate and has been charged the one night that they said they would charge you

176
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:31,120
 when you booked. That I think is what has happened. Right so the law in the UK requires

177
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,680
 customers not be charged unfair charges and there is specific case law for hotel rooms which says

178
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,600
 that if a hotel room is if somebody has to cancel then a consumer as opposed to a business so if

179
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,080
 you booked as a business you will be straight out of luck but if you book as a consumer the hotel

180
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,320
 may only charge their reasonable loss which is the loss to them if they cannot re let the room

181
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,920
 which they obviously will be able to do in this case or and therefore a small admin fee

182
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,720
 so. But that's insane. No it's not. Okay so although there are a load of things that are

183
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,240
 making life much worse for people in the modern age because consumer law isn't as strong as it

184
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,240
 used to be you don't need to throw away the rights that you do have the UK and the EU have

185
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,720
 quite strong consumer protections and this is one of the areas where they apply. Why doesn't it

186
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,560
 apply to train? And indeed if you cancel your train ticket well in advance to say I need to

187
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,120
 cancel you will often be offered a voucher and also with airlines and this is why.

188
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,880
 I have never been offered a voucher for cancelling a train line trip in my entire life. Yes I called

189
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,360
 train line and argued very strenuously and they would not. I viewed the words non-refundable as

190
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,960
 meaning non-refundable and maybe I am out of touch on that but I just always assumed that was the deal.

191
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,200
 I mean does this mean every time I book a travel or dupere premiere in which are very distinct booking

192
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,600
 classes for you know advanced non-refundable and completely flexible then I should always

193
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,240
 book the events non-refundable and then if I don't want to go I should get all my money back anyway.

194
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:10,160
 Well they can charge you one night is very accepted. Charge you more than one night is the question.

195
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,840
 I must confess this doesn't drive with my lived experience at all but maybe I just don't argue

196
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,240
 strongly enough. I think this is me being old I think this is just a way in which the world has

197
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,200
 become more shitty. Quite possibly. I mean what will inevitably happen if that is the rule is all

198
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,280
 hotel rooms will get slightly more expensive. I don't see how they can get more expensive than

199
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:36,000
 the Hilton over about Easter weekend. I mean that is the other problem 185 pounds a night.

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,920
 I didn't think they could get more expensive than the Hilton in Birmingham in 2019 and Alison

201
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,680
 they managed it so I am never of the opinion thing can't get more expensive. It's tricky isn't it

202
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,920
 because I do take the point about consumer protection I think it is very good but also like

203
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,080
 the that's the trade off you make right you gamble that you won't have to cancel and will get cheaper

204
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,960
 will get a cheaper price and it's a gamble versus not gambling and paying them more money and I don't

205
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,160
 know if that's good. We might have gone off topic. Yeah it's a bit weird because I mean that's it

206
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,560
 like with you know hotels and trains to some extent and and airplanes I see okay there are various

207
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,520
 options. Some of them are refundable some of the non-refundable and pick one based on based on which

208
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,520
 one I think is best for me and it seems weird that if this is the actual situation under like

209
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:32,320
 consumer guidance that that has been persisting so possibly we all need to start booking non-refundable

210
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,760
 things and attempting to get our money back from them. I invite you to try that one with say BA

211
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,960
 whose response to oh you've got COVID and you can't fly all right well that sucks then doesn't it?

212
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,280
 Now Northern Stage so the theatre on Newcastle campus is called Northern Stage and I had to

213
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,920
 cancel two tickets to see a comedy gig and they were like well we're not going to give you money back

214
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,240
 with the with the net effect that whenever they're like would you like to donate some extra on your

215
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,280
 ticket? I'm like no absolutely not you can sort off but when I called the stage in Edinburgh to let

216
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,200
 them know I couldn't go to my Wozniak they just gave me a full refund no questions asked so I like

217
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,560
 the stage and I go back there very often. Yeah I mean I basically think that you phone and if they

218
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,360
 still say no then you write them a letter citing the law the consumer law which is quite clear

219
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,520
 and say the law doesn't allow you to do this. Yeah now I know that that is now that I know that

220
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:34,320
 that is a thing we've educated our listeners hopefully. I have a really good page on canceling goods or

221
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,280
 services and advice for advice for customers and I'm going to put it in the show notes. I don't know

222
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,880
 if it's true. I mean I know what the law says but I mean what you do is you write a letter saying I

223
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,120
 will take you to I am prepared to take you to the small came's court. When you take them to the small

224
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,160
 claims court that costs you in a map which is not very high but when you win if you win which you will

225
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,240
 you'll get their money back. So generally speaking writing a letter saying I am intending to take

226
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,960
 you to the small claims court will cause the money to come back. Now whether it works for things

227
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,760
 like trains where they I think the train companies may argue that they cannot resell your ticket.

228
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,960
 But I think it probably depends a little bit how far in advance you cancel. If I'm like at the

229
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,280
 station having just missed the train I would be sympathetic to their argument but if I cancel it

230
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:26,880
 three weeks in advance I'd be a bit less convinced. Can you link that in the what's names? Also if

231
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,240
 this is consumer law so if you're somebody who runs a small business that is you and you're inclined

232
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,680
 to book things as of your business that as soon as it's a business to business transaction none of

233
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,720
 this applies. Businesses are expected to read contracts.

234
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,240
 I will note that on Anonymous Claire there has been some discussion and there's at least one

235
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,040
 person who basically said that they decided not to say in the Hilton as a direct result of reading

236
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,920
 the Hilton's terms of conditions. So I think I think the Hilton's terms of conditions may say

237
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,000
 all this but as Alison notes it might be worth arguing because you might be able to successfully

238
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,640
 argue those terms of conditions are unreasonable. More generally if you're a consumer and a term

239
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,080
 is in fine print then it doesn't actually apply if you take it to a small Cables court because there

240
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,880
 is case law that says consumers can't be expected to read the fine print so they have to put it in

241
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,680
 nice big print if they're going to do it. It has to be like on the face of the thing which they may

242
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,160
 say it is because it says non-refundable so you know but I mean it's worth trying right?

243
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,920
 It's in like big letters as big as any other letters on the page in bold.

244
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,920
 Yeah I mean if they've made you tick through a box I understand if I cancel for any reason I'm

245
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,720
 not getting my money back you probably you may be out of luck. I don't know it's worth going.

246
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,360
 Well I'll leave all of this in anyway. Yes threatening to take things to the small

247
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,280
 Cables court has always worked really well for me which I'm also doing I'm also going to give you

248
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,880
 a link to that it's not even called small claims anymore I think.

249
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,600
 No it's called money claim online I think. Money claim online. Make court claim for money

250
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,120
 but anyway consumer law it's good because it's very easy for people to say oh no no all of that's

251
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,800
 very old fashioned and we don't need it anymore our consumers are so much more knowledgeable than

252
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:21,920
 they used to be. I definitely don't think we should erode consumer protections unlike you know the

253
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:28,320
 government. Unlike the government yeah but I just didn't know this was one I guess.

254
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,680
 Well it's contracts generally. My will be that I can choose to enter into a variety of different

255
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:42,080
 terms and conditions and therefore I've chosen to enter into the cheapest one under those conditions

256
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:49,440
 would be an interesting thing to discuss. Yeah I think I think I do think yes I do I think that is

257
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,840
 the way I was thinking about it. Right shall we move on from British consumer consumer protection

258
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,000
 law? Yeah I just don't think we should take it lying dad. We said we were going to have a short

259
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,320
 this is what happens when we have a short episode because often we get to a point where John goes

260
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,360
 we've got a lot to get through this week so this is not one of those weeks. And also you said about

261
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,720
 being more contentious and I think opening a kind of worms as to the relative merits of protecting

262
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,000
 businesses versus consumers in British consumer protection law that will definitely get us letters

263
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,360
 so this is good. Next episode just letters about capitalism. What do you think about capitalism

264
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,400
 listeners right in? No don't don't don't don't but if you try to take the Hilton to the small

265
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,120
 or hotel to a small claims court for non-refunding your non-refundable thing then they do let us know.

266
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,200
 I'm also right to like the Guardian and Martin Lewis um tell them. No there are pages about money

267
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,800
 saving expert but I think I've linked directly to gov.uk because I think the gov.uk play just

268
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,160
 pretty clear. Yes there are links in the show notes listeners. Non-refundable deposits should

269
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,720
 only be a small percentage of the total price. Cancellation charges must be a genuine estimate

270
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,240
 of the businesses direct loss. Oh I'm deep in annex A unfair contract terms now so yeah.

271
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,920
 Anyway shall we move on to something that maybe is of interest to people who have not

272
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,240
 recently booked Hilton hotels in the UK. Uh that is true yes sorry to our international listeners

273
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,080
 if you have better consumer protection good for you and if you don't we're sorry.

274
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:40,640
 Let's move on to discussing a different convention which is in this case the Seattle World

275
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:48,240
 Comp because things have happened. Seattle announced in December that they will use virtual business

276
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,320
 meetings instead of the at-con meeting and at the time they announced the dates that the meetings

277
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,240
 would be on but they have now announced some more information including the platform and the

278
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:04,000
 timing. So they're using a platform called Lumi Global which honestly looks very like corporate

279
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,840
 which could be could be a good thing here right. It appears to be the thing used by a bunch of

280
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:17,280
 corporations to like run their AGMs and so on with thousands of people and has lots of solutions

281
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,000
 for doing virtual hybrid meetings having voting having authentication having a way to manage the

282
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,280
 Q&A and so on. So it's interesting I mean I never heard of it but then I have never tried to run

283
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,360
 an extremely corporate AGM. What will be interesting is to know whether what works for say Tesco can

284
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,400
 be applied to WISFS because I would venture to suggest that not many people are at like

285
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,240
 the Tesco annual general meeting because they plan to stand up and make comments six times and

286
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,120
 go up to the microphone. So it'll be interesting because it's obviously a platform that works for

287
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,760
 massive corporations but massive corporations work in a slightly different way to WISFS but

288
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,640
 you do need something that people trust to kind of do all the authentication and the voting stuff.

289
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,280
 So yeah that looks pretty good to me. I mean obviously I'm looking at their webpage but

290
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,800
 they kind of say helping more people engage with your statutory meetings is a bonus so they

291
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,440
 they have increasing engagement and making it easy for people to engage as one of the

292
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,880
 good features about their platform and and they say a low latency environment which is great and

293
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:32,000
 I like because WISFS is quite a high latency environment because there'll be people who want

294
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,360
 to intervene all the time and deliberately sit at the very back of a very big room so that when

295
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,800
 they are called to the microphone there's then approximately a 45 second wait while they walk

296
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:51,680
 up and go to the front as if they just want a bAFTA. The thing is I think that is a cynical view

297
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,560
 but it is very funny and it probably is a little bit true so yeah.

298
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,320
 I watched the bAFTA so there was somebody who was extraordinarily surprised to win their bAFTA

299
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,680
 and there's this look of absolute extreme shock when he wins and one of the comments on this I think

300
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,840
 in one of the newspapers said it wasn't just a surprise to him it was also the surprise to the

301
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,640
 person who'd worked out the seating plan for the bafters.

302
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,680
 Oh man you know I never thought of that but you've occasionally got to put people who might win at

303
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,960
 the back right otherwise it's dead giveaway. Yeah so they put people who they know are coming up

304
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,760
 like the winners of the the winners of the achievement towards and things like that always gets

305
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,760
 get aisle seats but you can't know with nominees so they have to kind of they have they basically

306
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,240
 do a guess that's who's most likely to be called up but those people do the edge.

307
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,000
 There is interesting we look forward to seeing how it goes. I love the fact that people hadn't

308
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,600
 prepared speeches at the bafters and I'm like oh we've knocked that out of people to the hugos

309
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:04,080
 after incidents like Alison in 2006. To be fair I do assume that a lot of the people at the bafters

310
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,760
 have had a bit more experience in this whole awards thing and also many of them are better at

311
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,880
 public speaking off the cuff than we are and yet maybe not so much actually it does that.

312
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,960
 We're quite good at speaking off the cuff Liz on account of how we've now done 129 episodes of a

313
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,160
 award-winning podcast. Did you deliberately pronounce that in the style of Matt Berry?

314
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,760
 Yeah. Okay. Speaking of participating in the business meeting the other thing they announced

315
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,280
 along with the dates of the virtual business meetings if they also announced their time slot

316
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:41,120
 and all the business meetings will be running 9am to 12.30pm in Pacific Daylight time which is

317
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,600
 seven hours behind UTC. That is and I think I've done the time wrong conversion correctly this time

318
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,800
 11pm to 2.30am in my time zone so I predict I will be going to almost none of the business meeting.

319
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,840
 Oh I think you could go there with a big sign of sign-up saying tard and angry.

320
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,080
 What is not clear about their platform is whether you can actually see all the people who are there

321
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,360
 are only like invited you know the head table and invited speakers as would be sensible

322
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:16,240
 so there's no point me cosplaying. But yes so when they when they said back in December that they

323
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,840
 would be taking into account religious observances work commitments and time zone differences

324
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,840
 they've taken account of it and they've picked a time zone that works basically for everyone from

325
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:34,720
 like east coast so for everyone from west coast US through to probably Europe and an hour ahead of

326
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,800
 mainland Europe and they will all be accommodated by this although some of the meetings are on a

327
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:48,640
 Friday morning in the US so some people are going to meet work so basically I can exhibit it basically

328
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,400
 a picture time zone that I think will accommodate the most people possible. Unfortunately by doing

329
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,800
 them all at the same time they are going to systematically exclude everyone who lives in

330
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,920
 Australia, New Zealand and anywhere you know east of about India so you in some you lose some.

331
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:12,240
 So I was sort of hoping they do one maybe at a different time. I think probably it's 85%

332
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:22,880
 USA and Europe at least possibly greater though maybe if we had more access to business meetings

333
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:30,560
 then it would get a greater global participation. I feel like also people who care enough will set

334
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:36,240
 their alarm clocks and get to it no matter how difficult that is but I understand that that's

335
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,080
 that's quite a hard barrier. But also that's the that's the argument that's always made about

336
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,920
 the business meeting at conventions with people who care enough will be there and it's like no

337
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:52,000
 they'd sometimes are busy. This is yes this is way more accessible than business meetings at

338
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,200
 conventions. Yeah but I'm just skeptical of the more I think about it the more I think the answer

339
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,080
 is not to have an audio visual component and to have it work more like Python where you have like

340
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,920
 proposals made to the community and voting and it is done in text and over the period of like

341
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:16,080
 several weeks per proposal because it would take a lot longer in terms of going from start to end

342
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,760
 of any given thing but it would be a lot fairer and you wouldn't have to do it. It's not it doesn't

343
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,480
 have to be in real time so it doesn't really matter but I need to work that opinion out some more.

344
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,960
 I love that opinion and I'm going to amplify it by saying you don't have to not have an audio

345
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:40,240
 visual component because you could ask people to record short videos where they speak for or

346
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,040
 against items and then you can have those available for people to look at if they would like and I

347
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,280
 think that would be quite useful. I mean we already do do the business meeting thing where you know

348
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,400
 someone who the people for it against the amendment right a short thing about it which I agree we

349
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,440
 should do more of. I quite like doing that with audio visual because I think things like

350
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,760
 diagrams and actually having people standing up and speaking might be quite useful in this context

351
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,440
 you know presentation is a good I'm starting pushing back against that because I do not want

352
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,400
 to watch a bunch of random pieces meeting attendees. Yes please you can have a transcript too.

353
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,640
 That is the problem right like we do a podcast and I don't mind listening to things but I know

354
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,280
 that there are some people who are ferociously against video content and so yeah but I quite like

355
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,480
 the idea but I'm sort of conscious of how not everyone might. I mean I will just say that one

356
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,080
 of the things it does look for is the official Chinese time zone I think is an hour ahead of me.

357
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,240
 I was going to note this. Given that we just had a large world con in China I hope

358
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,400
 you guys like staying up till 3am but A you got it better than Australia.

359
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,960
 Oh is this a Chinese time zone ahead of you? Because China's all on one time zone.

360
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,280
 I maybe don't understand where Thailand is. What what are the dates? July the 4th,

361
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,200
 July the 13th, July the 19th and July the 25th so roughly a week apart but space you get two Fridays

362
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,400
 a Sunday and a Saturday. I feel like I'm going to be on a holiday the whole all of those again.

363
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,440
 Which is the other problem. Oh that Friday is July 4th so although it is in the working day for

364
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,240
 people in America nobody in America will be working. It will be for Canadians though.

365
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,120
 It will be for Canadians. Because Canadians don't celebrate American Independence Day on account

366
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,160
 of how they're Canadian and Mexicans and people in South America. There's a lot of people in that

367
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,360
 time zone for whom it will be a working day. Right that's time zone sorted out listeners.

368
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,520
 Let's move on to Hugo nominations. Oh not by any means like a girl for hours. No. No thank you.

369
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,800
 Seems you're not even sure where Thailand is I think no passing judgment on our time zones.

370
00:30:52,800 --> 00:31:01,600
 Savage. Got an idea of some cover art though. It's a map.

371
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:09,440
 Pin Tyler donna map with three little silhouettes and like three Tyler donkey tails. Hugo nominations

372
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,080
 are now open. I'm going to record a little thing for the start of the every episode.

373
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,840
 Like it was just a little sentence because of what happened with Hugo Girl and because we can't

374
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,800
 expect people to have listened since last year but it will have been at the beginning of the episode

375
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,480
 listeners you will have heard it. I'm going to record it now. Please note we have recused ourselves

376
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,720
 from consideration for the 2025 Hugo's in the category of Best Frankast. Fabulous. Right and

377
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,400
 Liz and I can't talk about anything that was published last year now so we won't. Please do go

378
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,760
 and nominate things for Hugo Awards. I am allowed to say that nominating things for Hugo Awards is a

379
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,680
 good and valorous activity. The system is very easy and the thing that we do say every year but

380
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,120
 it's really important that you know if you haven't nominated for the Hugo before you can nominate a

381
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,000
 few things and then you can go back and nominate other things it's okay. When you nominate when

382
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,720
 you save out your nominations it will save what you've done so far but it's not like a once of

383
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,920
 raw things. So if you're kind of like oh I don't know what I want to nominate for the Hugo but I do

384
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:21,200
 know about these two things in this one category go and nominate them and then if you and then come

385
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,960
 back and nominate other stuff later because every nomination is good and important and helpful.

386
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,360
 Actually that's probably to take you to bit far but you know and you could nominate for the

387
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:39,200
 Hugo's if you are a member of the Seattle Wilcon or if you were a Wussfuss member of the Glasgow

388
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,400
 Wilcon. I think also if you're a Wussfuss member of the LA Wilcon is that right guys?

389
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:51,040
 No I think maybe we just called for it once. I thought we got rid of that. Hang on

390
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,680
 while I find the Wussfuss Constitution.

391
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,480
 Yeah I don't know if it's gotten old for listeners but it hasn't gotten old for John or Alison.

392
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,760
 Hey I mean I should just have this open in a tab before the start of every every episode really.

393
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,520
 Ah each member of the administering Wilcon or the immediately preceding Wilcon

394
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,560
 shall be allowed to make up to five weighted nominations in each category.

395
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,840
 Yeah we got rid of the thing where it's next year because it was kind of pointless.

396
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,000
 Thank you Liz. I can't imagine there were very many people who were Wussfuss members of the

397
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,200
 following Wilcon but not either of the previous two. Yeah basically if you're a Wussfuss member

398
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,960
 by 18 months before the convention then yeah you probably won't. Still get two years out of it so

399
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,480
 yeah. But this means guys if you were a member of Glasgow but you haven't joined Seattle because

400
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,960
 you can't possibly get to Seattle this year. You can still nominate and I bet there's a lot of

401
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,600
 listeners in that category. So you can get all those cool British things onto the ballot except

402
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,480
 not but you might get some of the cool British things onto the long list that comes out after the awards.

403
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:08,560
 What do we want to do now? Some picks. Picks or do we want to do... What else are we going to do?

404
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,280
 That's a great question. I don't know. I don't think I have anything else. Oh I would say one thing.

405
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,600
 Last time we discussed the town hall that the 2026 Eastcon was going to do but I don't think

406
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,240
 any of us went. So if anyone else went please tell us what was said and whether it was good.

407
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,160
 Thank you. Also happening after we record but before the episode goes out is the BSFA's EGM. So

408
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,200
 if you went to that write to us and tell us what we said. Also I have the agenda for that which is

409
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,520
 what they were going to talk about if that would be interesting. So there's five things.

410
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,760
 Draft proposal for BSFA charitable status. The process guidelines for the best translation

411
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,040
 award where they're planning a jury award. Member ballot matters arising from the AGM 2024 succession

412
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,120
 planning BSFA chair at AGM 2025 which is I believe the thing that we talked about a little bit on

413
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,520
 the last octothorb and AOB. I don't imagine there'll be much of that famous last words.

414
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,840
 So that is happening after we record but before this episode it goes out.

415
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,800
 Okay.

416
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:28,800
 Pics. Can I go first? I'm not going to pick a book from this last year because of matters

417
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,200
 discussed earlier in the episode and I've not really played any new games or watched any new

418
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:41,280
 movies. So instead I am going to pick Star Wars Galaxy's Edge the official Black Spire Outpost

419
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,280
 cookbook which came out before 2024 and is not therefore Hugo eligible this year listeners.

420
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,720
 It's quite good. The reason I pick it is because yesterday I made Hutti's slime pods which are

421
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,520
 very lovely and they go squish squish squish but they're basically gnocchi and cana-lini beans

422
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:10,560
 in a sort of spinach and pistachio and lime and avocado pesto with parmesan and double cream

423
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:18,000
 and it's very nice and it's very yummy. The notes for it say that it serves two humans or is a

424
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,600
 small appetizer for one young Hutt. So now you know and it's very lovely. So yes that's my pick

425
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,800
 a surprisingly good cookbook. It also has a recipe for black bean hummus in it which is quite lovely.

426
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:38,320
 I am super skeptical about themed cookbooks of this kind. I wanted it. I didn't buy it as a gift

427
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,560
 but I asked for it because I wanted for my Star Wars role-playing games to have like some

428
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,720
 in-universe examples of food that exists that I could say to my players existed rather than like

429
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,000
 they've got space apples which is often what you end up falling back on. They're like apples but

430
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,080
 spacey. Spapples. Oh yeah no that sounds good and somebody said oh and if you're having like a

431
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,360
 May the 4th party then this is great for your food for your May the 4th party and I could get

432
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:15,120
 behind that. Yes but I also think I don't know how many good recipes you expect in a given cookbook.

433
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:20,000
 Three. That's fair. So I've got two out of this one and I haven't made it all yet so I actually

434
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,720
 think like as themed cookbooks go because the great thing about the Hutties slime pods is that they're

435
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,600
 very easy to make in advance and they're also very easy to make completely vegetarian but they're

436
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,680
 chock full of protein because they've got pistachios and avocados and cheese and cream in them and

437
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:44,880
 beans so like they're very filling and if you use vegetarian parmesan then yeah it's just they're

438
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:52,240
 good. I like them. So yes I'm surprisingly pleased with the experience of having that cookbook so far.

439
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,280
 I have not bought any other Star Wars cookbooks though. But yes I did already have an answer to

440
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,320
 your rhetorical question about cookbooks because I have a lot of cookbooks. No it wasn't it's not

441
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,640
 actually a rhetorical one it's like a genuine like because obviously they're not all going to be

442
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,960
 bangers but I don't know it's an interesting three. Three. All right. I'm also decluttering

443
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,560
 cookbooks this week or next in the next few weeks certainly. If you have any Star Wars ones let me know.

444
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,640
 Obviously not and also my cookbooks are a mess. I mean most of the ones we're throwing away will go

445
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:31,200
 in the bin. Liz. I have two questions. One does your Black Spire outpost cookbook include those

446
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,880
 rather nice wraps that you get in Ronto Roasters and Galaxy Zech. Yes. I suppose I don't really need a

447
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,400
 recipe for a breakfast wrap with like eggs and sausage in but they're quite good. Also I would

448
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,880
 like to share my sleep off Hugo Girl because I found a goody on goodreads for this book.

449
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,800
 Which is from Julie. No pulled pork sandwiches seriously.

450
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:01,280
 What? What? Pogs. Oh pulled pork. Yes. Sorry do I need to repeat that to you?

451
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:09,440
 It's a joke that works better in text I feel but pulled pork sandwiches. That was another non-verbal

452
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,000
 joke. Yes. Sorry. Sorry to Julie from Goodreads we did not fully appreciate your joke there.

453
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,880
 Well you did but we didn't. All right shall I go next? Oh can I read a goody from Goodreads?

454
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,520
 Goodreads. Yeah yeah you can. Mike Kennedy says this cookbook just seemed like marketing for the new

455
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,360
 Star Wars land opened in Florida and California. That is some astute criticism. I wanted to say

456
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,560
 something about this which is that actually the fact that it is not really a Star Wars cookbook

457
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,800
 is it? It's a Star Wars galaxy's edge so therefore Disneyland cookbook which means that they probably

458
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,120
 serve some of this stuff at Galaxy's edge which means that there's some chance the recipes have

459
00:39:53,120 --> 00:40:00,240
 all been tested which is the problem with IP themed cookbooks in general. So you know when I asked if

460
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:07,280
 they had a recipe for the breakfast wraps they serve at Ronto Rosas in Disneyland. They have a Ronto

461
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,000
 wrap recipe but it's not the same Ronto wrap and I don't quite understand why because the one that's

462
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,800
 actually in there seems like it's more involved than the one they serve in the park but I don't know

463
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,840
 but if this Star Wars cookbook is not your taste there are many other Star Wars cookbooks

464
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:31,760
 but this one came with the Star Wars apron. I'm gonna pick a book. Oh! Since I am not talking about

465
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,720
 things from 2024 I thought I would go back a little bit and pick Nova by Samuel Delaney which

466
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,640
 was published in 1968. I have somehow got this far without reading it so I thought that was a thing

467
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,040
 I should rectify and I'm glad I did because it is still great. It's basically Space Opera. It's

468
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,600
 about the spaceship captain Lok Von Ray. He is looking for a Nova because it will allow him access

469
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:04,480
 to a massive source of Illyrium which is the Galactic power source normally found only in tiny

470
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,040
 amounts and essentially Lok Von Ray is from one very rich galactic family and he's having an ongoing

471
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:19,600
 feud vendetta rivalry with the science of another enormous extremely rich galactic family and so by

472
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,480
 scoring a massive shot of Illyrium he will essentially upend the entire galactic economy.

473
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,360
 So it's got, I mean that's just a kind of very basic idea of the plot but that really does not

474
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:37,760
 cover it at all. The tone is just really excellent. It's kind of got a lot of like there's a lot of

475
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,120
 tarot in there. Everything is like you know the backdrop is that no one eats anymore we just use

476
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,440
 IV drips basically everyone is a cyborg and that's how they fly the ships and there's like fictional

477
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,960
 fictional philosophers and psychologists who decided that making everyone a cyborg would make everyone's

478
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:02,160
 work life happier. I really enjoyed it. It's very well written. It does not feel like it was written

479
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,920
 over 56 years ago and it was apparently nominated for the Hugo for Best Novel but it lost two.

480
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,600
 What did lose two? Okay it lost to Standon's Anzi Bar and to be fair I also really like Standon's

481
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:21,840
 Anzi Bar so I can't argue about that one too much but yeah I just I love finding all the classic

482
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,040
 works because we all know that like sometimes people go and say oh what should I read in some

483
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,720
 more suggested classic work and it is terrible and they just have a load of nostalgia for their

484
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,600
 childhood or whatever and so I really like going and reading classic works that get recommended

485
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,400
 and they are really good and this one is really good so there you go. I have read this book but

486
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,920
 it was a long time ago and my memory is gone now. Took get all, getting all this terrible.

487
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,920
 Sorry I can't hear you Alison. I have also not read this and I have not read Standon's Anzi

488
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,760
 Bar so I guess I have homework. Oh yeah no you do because Standon's Anzi Bar so you pick that

489
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,760
 next time John. The forum big serious Bronner books about kind of things that are going along

490
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,920
 in the world. They're all good and Standon's Anzi Bar is probably the one that has survived

491
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,440
 best. Interesting okay I'll add it to the big list after I finish my cloud greeting.

492
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,240
 Yeah though obviously brother can be a painter for because you know did you meet him?

493
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:25,600
 I have never met John Bronner. As noted he died in the middle of the 95 Worldcon.

494
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:31,120
 He did yes. Oof. He was at Easter call and I spent quite a lot of time drinking with him

495
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:37,520
 and Bob Shaw at the 1995 EasterCon Bob was a guest of honor and Bob and John were obviously friends.

496
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,200
 I've just checked and I think my memory is correct. When Peter Weston started up his well we started

497
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:52,880
 up his fanzine relapse in I think the early 2010s. There was the best article that ever appeared in

498
00:43:52,880 --> 00:44:00,320
 relapse was The Home Life of the Bronners by John Nielsen Hall. Yes yeah no it is if you've not read

499
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,680
 The Home Life of the Bronners by John Nielsen Hall listeners it is one of the finest fanzine

500
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:12,320
 articles ever written and I'm sure it's on fanact.org you can go and get it. I'll find out when it was

501
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:18,400
 either prolapse or relapse yeah. Yeah I was looking for that and I also found a memory of

502
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,120
 John Bronner from Ian Watson as well so yeah they're all I think they're all on there.

503
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,720
 Alison what's your pick? So my pick this week because I am the one person on the pod who can talk

504
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,880
 about things that were published in 2024 but I'm not sure I'm going to get any come back from my

505
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:43,200
 fellow hosts. We have discussed this book. We already discussed this book in a previous episode

506
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,240
 so if you want to hear our thoughts go back and listen to the last couple. It was in the episode

507
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,080
 where they talked about what they were nominating at this point I have not read it. I have now read

508
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:59,920
 it. It is The Ministry of Time by Kalyan Kalyan Bradley. This makes it three sci-fi romances

509
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,640
 in a row for me and singers and I don't mean romance sci-fi romance in the way of Jules Verne. I mean

510
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,600
 actual genre romance sci-fi blends which is I've definitely not read three of those in a row before

511
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:22,720
 so this is actually quite a good sci-fi show. I think so the premise is that we are following a

512
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:30,080
 young woman who has acquired a job working in the time travel branch of the UK civil service

513
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:36,880
 where her colleagues are about to pull five people out of time and to see if a time machine works

514
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,280
 because they have got a time machine. They've got a working time machine and they pull five

515
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,680
 people out of time who would have died quite quickly anyway. One of them is Lieutenant Gore of

516
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:57,760
 the Franklin expedition and our main character is set I guess looking after him while they keep him

517
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,400
 on house arrest or near to house arrest for a year which is kind of the main part of the book.

518
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,280
 She gets the job because she's a linguist and expert in refugees and one of the ways in which

519
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,520
 this book is really good is it talks a lot about what it is like to be out of place and a refugee

520
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,720
 and also have some constraints on what you can do. Nevertheless I was very light-toned in the first

521
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,360
 part of the book because they're kind of doing the rom-com bit with a whole lot of odd couple

522
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:32,320
 with time things like oh this is the internet you know I mean how does that work if you're from

523
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,800
 the Franklin expedition and so in case you don't know what the Franklin expedition is the book has

524
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,960
 helpful flashbacks in time because I do know quite a lot about Franklin already because I've spent

525
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:52,720
 afternoons hanging out with a friend who is fairly obsessed with it. These didn't maybe land

526
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,880
 as well for me as I have done for people who weren't already familiar with that but they will they

527
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,640
 will clue you in on what he was doing and what happened to that expedition if you don't already

528
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:10,720
 know and that's it for time travel for the majority of the book so it's enough because that is you've

529
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,360
 got your fantastic setting but the time travel just kind of happens at the beginning and then sits

530
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,520
 there and then there is a bunch of timey-wimy stuff at the end when they're wrapping everything up

531
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,400
 that bit at the end didn't quite land for me and I think it may not land for quite a lot of

532
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,000
 genre science fiction fans because you might have read things a bit like this before

533
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,520
 in a way that that slightly undermines the novel but overall I thought it was very very good one of

534
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,840
 the best novels I've read this year will be on my Hugo Ballot and yes it's kind of got quite a

535
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,160
 bit of genre amounts in it but it does have all of the trappings and it doesn't do everything you

536
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:52,240
 might expect to happen so yeah it's really really good and I would recommend it to everybody and I

537
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,880
 think the other two have already said this in previous episodes so. Liss and John have no comment

538
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,320
 at the present time. Liss and John have no comment on the present time but did make comment on this

539
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:09,600
 book in previous episodes. That's a funny funny business isn't it so go back in time and listen

540
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,160
 to what they had to say and not forget. That was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye from me.

541
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,240
 It's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me.

542
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:37,360
 [Music]

543
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,320
 I'll have to separate them out in the edit listeners because in real life you wouldn't be able to

544
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,680
 tell what I thought what I was saying unless you'd recorded 129 episodes of a podcast with your

545
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,040
 co-host. Yeah I didn't hear Alice and Tom. I just stopped because I clearly was getting anywhere this time.

546
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,920
 Hey I got a word in edge ways ahead of Alice and...

547
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:05,040
 Okay okay it's been 129 episode journey.
