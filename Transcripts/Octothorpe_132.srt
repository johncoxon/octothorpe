1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 You should say that a bit closer microphone then it can be the outro.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,640
 I'm sorry apparently I am just talking bollocks. There we go.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:15,920
 What I like about that is that whole thing can be the pre-show.

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,240
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 132nd episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,520
 science fiction and science fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 7th of April 2025.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,200
 I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,320
 This episode is coming to you early this week. There will be no episode on the Thursday.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,600
 But what we do have is some chat about the Hugo finalists.

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,200
 It's opinions really. I mean I assume our listeners have mostly seen

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,000
 the Hugo finalists if you haven't well we'll tell you about them but mostly you want our views

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,720
 and opinions and thoughts and hot takes and all that.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,440
 And of course we have to be quite careful about this because John and I are the Hugo

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,520
 finalists liaison team and we love all our Hugo finalists equally.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,160
 Yes and we really do. I think it's a very strong roster this year. I'm not just saying that.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,840
 I'm not liaison so presumably I can be the bad cop.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,440
 As rude as you like yep.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,600
 In the category of astounding award the finalists are

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,160
 Monocool, Black Goose, Bethany Jacobs, Hannah Kana, Angela Liu, Jared Petcheczyk and Tia Tashiro.

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,680
 I am familiar with Monocool, Black Goose and Hannah Kana because they were in last

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,400
 year's Astounding Award roster but I confess the others are new to me and I will be looking forward

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,000
 to looking them up.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,480
 So yes Bethany Jacobs has two novels out now I believe, Her debut novel was out in 2023.

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,720
 Tia Tashiro and Angela Liu I know are short fiction writers and Jared Petcheczyk,

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,120
 debut novel was out in 2024, The West Passage which is very well regarded.

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,360
 I understand. I haven't read it yet because I don't think it's actually out in the UK

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,520
 yet but it did win the Crawford Award for Best debut fancy novel.

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,360
 Yes the Crawford Award which is administered by Friend of the Podcast, Farah Menderson.

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,120
 Was I believe Farah has stepped down.

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,480
 Farah was the administrator for the West Passage winning and is now being succeeded by Kelly Robson

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
 who may be a friend of the podcast. Kelly if you're listening, re-in.

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,640
 So yeah I mean I'm really keen to read the West Passage which I've heard good things about but

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,920
 haven't got round to it because of the aforementioned not being out in the UK yet.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,320
 I have also heard good things about these burning stars by Bethany Jacobs from Friends Who've Read It

34
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,880
 I was nominated for Locust Waterfest novel last year so yeah it seems like a solid solid list.

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,400
 The Load Star Award for Best YA Book is The Feast Makers by H.A. Clark,

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,840
 Heavenly Tyrant by Joanne Jayzau. The Made in the Crocodile by Jordan Ifueku. Moonstorm by Yoon Ha Lee.

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,280
 Ah shiny Lendy. I'm so sorry that's definitely not right by Darcy Little Badger and So Let

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,120
 Them Burn by Camilla Cole. I've not heard of Camilla Cole or H.A. Clark before but I look forward to

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,440
 reading their books but everyone else I have read books by before and I enjoyed them all so I will

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,360
 look forward to reading these books. So then we have The Category of Best Poem which is being run

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,120
 as a special category by the Seattle Worldcon and this is a very interesting roster I think.

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,560
 So we have Calypso by Oliver K. Langmead, Ever Noir by Marines. There are No Taxis for the Dead by Angela

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,600
 Lu, A War of Words by Marie Brennan, We Drink Lava by A Zhang and You're Visiting Dragon by Devon Barlow.

44
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,320
 And yeah that's a so Calypso is a long form poem it's it's sort of novel length. I think most of the

45
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,080
 others of these are short poems so that is going to be interesting. I have not read any of the poems

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,960
 except for Calypso and I will look forward to reading them as I say. I assume they're all freely

47
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,440
 available online before the packet comes out it looks like they are the only one I'm not sure about.

48
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,960
 The Devon Barlow is from the Fund Drive for Strange Horizons so I don't know if that's

49
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,320
 only available to backers and Havens Spec Magazine I don't know if they put their issues online for

50
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,360
 reading. So the Strange Horizons Fund Drive issues are also just online for everyone they're like

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,920
 what you get when you meet certain stretch goals but they're not like private to any people who

52
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,240
 paid for them and the Havens Spec poem is online so you can go and read all the nominees sorry all

53
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,000
 the finalists. Except for Calypso which you might have to buy but it is I did enjoy it very much.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,640
 Yeah I think Calypso being novel length is probably something you'll have to buy but who knows it

55
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,520
 might be in the packet. I haven't read any of them I'm very excited. I'm very pleased that

56
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,400
 I mean I will say I did not nominate anything in poem because I don't really read poetry and

57
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
 therefore had nothing to put in that box so I'm very pleased to see that there are enough people

58
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,080
 who read Transfictional Poetry and nominate for you goes that that you know is enough to get us a

59
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,120
 really interesting looking shortlist and yeah it's one of those years where there happens to be a

60
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,600
 prominent novel in verse basically which in a lot of years there is not so you get this

61
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,160
 interesting way you've got five shorter works and then one very long poem so yeah.

62
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,360
 One honking great big thing. Mmm. Then we have Best Fan Artist which some of us may have opinions on

63
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:50,000
 so we have Ian Clark, Sarah Felix, Meg Frank, Michelle Morell, Spanish Sheriff and Alison Scott,

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,880
 longtime fan artist followers will know that five of those names are repeat finalists. Michelle

65
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,320
 Morell is the new finalist she is the she is one of the DHS for Seattle and she did some beautiful

66
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,840
 Seattle cross stitches which are very very lovely but I think all of these people do phenomenal art

67
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,120
 and it is a very strong roster so hurrah. It's also a very traditional fanish roster like all of

68
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,720
 these people are doing art for fanzines and conventions and that is not always true in fan

69
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,280
 artists which is not an editorial comment it's just a note of a fact. I am obviously going to remain

70
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,520
 scrupulously neutral about this category I don't want any of my co-hosts or co-hosts spouses to trap

71
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:45,040
 you down. We know where you live Liz somewhere in Toyland. Oh it's true Alison knows where I live

72
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,480
 she sent me a snow globe full of weed mix. I've sent you a few things sent you a postcard in Thai.

73
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,440
 Ah yes but can you take that address I gave you in Thai and successfully work out where I live.

74
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:04,560
 That is fair that is a fair question and then for best fan writer we have Camistross for Lapton,

75
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,080
 Abigail Nussbaum, Rosanna Pendlebury, Jason Sanford, Alistair Stuart and Orgin Weston.

76
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,720
 So I think that is is that five repeat nominees and one new nominee? I think it might be.

77
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,760
 I don't think Rosanna or Camistross have been finalists previously but I might be wrong.

78
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,600
 I need to find out but didn't Camistross get a best related work?

79
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:36,400
 I mean spoilers for later. So yeah checking now I don't think Rosanna or Camistross have been

80
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,240
 nominated in this category before. Yes I think you're right there. I think everyone else has been.

81
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,200
 This is going to be a difficult category for me to voting because there's lots and lots of

82
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:54,640
 good people in that one. Yeah that is not untrue. Yeah obviously this podcast is a paid up member of

83
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,360
 the Rosanna Pendlebury Fan Club as you saw last week but also we're a paid up member of the Abigail

84
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,320
 Nussbaum Fan Club as you saw in OctaThops Passives so I'm not sure what we're supposed to do here.

85
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,280
 Yeah so this is going to be very tricky especially me because I nominated two of these people

86
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,240
 and so which ones do I vote for? I might not tell you who I nominated.

87
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,320
 Maybe you're into the suspense but it is probably obvious if you have been listening to OctaThop regularly

88
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,280
 who I nominated so there we go. But yeah I think it is very nice to see some new faces in this

89
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,640
 category because I think there are a lot of good fan writers and it is nice to share the glory

90
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,760
 around but also nice to see Abigail back again after her 2017 victory. A lot of victory is not

91
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:48,240
 really victory is it? 2017 win and then two best fan cast. Yes category obviously very interested

92
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,960
 in and very excited by and the nominees are The Kootrute Podcast eight days of Diana and Jones,

93
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,880
 Hugo Girl, Hugo's there, Amelia Thorns, world building for masochists and you'll get the full

94
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,560
 credits from the finalists list. Obviously we love all the Hugo finalists equally but Hugo Girl are

95
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,360
 our transatlantic besties so I'm a bit in the tank for them. However and we picked eight days of Diana

96
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,240
 win Jones on the pod. Yeah and I'm very pleased to see Amelia Thorns on there which I think has

97
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,240
 been doing great work. Interesting stuff. Yeah that's going to be a really hard one to pick.

98
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,920
 So Amelia Thorns and eight days of Diana win Jones are the two new ones here. I think all of the

99
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,520
 others are repeat. Yes Hugo Girl having recused in 2024 are back for 2025 as they said you know

100
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:47,440
 they're going to basically go for it again. They did win in 2023 but we all know that 2023 was a bit

101
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,800
 of a fuck up uh C. C Hugo nominations we're going to get to in a minute for that. Yeah.

102
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,800
 A slightly tarnished Hugo yeah not that not that Peter Weston's rocket's ever tarnish. No not even

103
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,680
 like ridiculous humidity it's still fine. The finalists in Best Fanzine are the insular review of books,

104
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,520
 Blackler problems, the full lid, Galactic Journey, Journey Planet and the unofficial Hugo

105
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:21,280
 Book Club blog. Five of these are repeat finalists but ancillary review of books is new and Liz is

106
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,120
 championing for a little while so I bet she's pleased about that. Yes. I'm a previous contributor

107
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,600
 to Galactic Journey and John is a previous editor of Journey Planet. Indeed indeed. I also believe I'm

108
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,600
 right in saying that ancillary review of books is the first is the only new finalist but only one of

109
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,800
 these has one previously which is Journey Planet so there is a five-sixth chance of a new Best

110
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,240
 Fanzine and that's cool. That is pretty good. I will say this was the Journey Planet did the

111
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,360
 excellent issue on unions in science fiction fantasy I believe in 2024 which I really enjoyed

112
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,200
 which I think was edited by Ola Venamanda from an official Hugo Book Club blog so they are sort of

113
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,360
 double nominees congratulations. Small and lovely small and lovely fandom this. So the few categories

114
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,040
 where I don't think we have a huge amount to say but we're going to let you know who they are.

115
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,560
 So Best Semi-Prozine we have The Deadlands, Escape Pod, Fire Magazine, a Black Specter to Fiction,

116
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,800
 Correo, Strange Horizons and on Canny Magazine and I think there's three previous winners there.

117
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,120
 I think Fire, Strange Horizons and on Canny have all won before. I think The Deadlands is a new

118
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,360
 nomey. You must assume that it's different. No no that was I believe correct. The finalists

119
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,560
 for Best Professional Artists are Michaela Alkaino, Audrey Benjaminson, Raveena Kai,

120
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,920
 Maurithio Manthierdi, Tran Win and Alyssa Winans. I think there are three repeat finalists which are

121
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,360
 Kai, Manthieri and Winans and I think the other three are new to the award so welcome welcome welcome

122
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,520
 pro his stuff. And the nice thing about Pro Artist is it is very easy to go and catch up on their

123
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:19,440
 works from the Hugo Packet and elsewhere and take a look and yeah Raveena Kai has one three

124
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,120
 you goes and I don't believe the others have won any. There's another five six chance of a new

125
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:34,560
 of a new winner. So the finalists in Best Editor long form are Carl Engelert, Ali Fisher, Lee Harris,

126
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,960
 David Thomasmore, Diana Enfoe and Stephanie Stein. I don't know if we have anything to say

127
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:48,240
 about this. I would like to say that David Thomasmore is an editor at Rebellion. Quite often the

128
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,320
 editor categories are dominated by American editors as you may expect because the voting pool is

129
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,280
 largely American. Lee Harris has been nominated before and I think has been nominated in Best Editor

130
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,560
 long form and Best Editor short form in the same year but David Thomasmore was nominated

131
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,440
 or was nominated previously in 2024 for his work with Solaris Aurelian but I think it's nice to see

132
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,960
 a bit of non-US editors getting in there. Best Editor short form is Scott H Andrews, Jennifer

133
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:27,120
 Brozek, Neil Clark, Jonathan Strand, Lynne Thomas and Michael Damien Thomas and Sheila Williams.

134
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,560
 Many of whom edit for semi-prosines or pro-sines but some are editing also for anthologies as well.

135
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,040
 Yeah, good bop bop bop bop. Well done to all of those people. But again I still find editor a very

136
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:48,400
 difficult category to vote in. I just find it very difficult to decide on, you know, in Best Editor

137
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,880
 long form to really know and I actually because a lot of the time I don't know who bought or

138
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,360
 commissioned books either even if I'm not directly judging the editing of the manuscripts so I do

139
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,640
 still find it a little bit tricky but that looks like a good slate of finalists.

140
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,120
 Yeah let's talk about best game or interactive work. Who wants to introduce this category?

141
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,480
 Mimi, me, me, me. So the finalists in Best Game are Caves of Could, Dragon Age the Vale Guard,

142
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,160
 the Legend of Zelda, Echoes of Wisdom, Lorelai in the Laser Rise, Tactical Breach Wizards

143
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,840
 and a Thousand Times Resist and I just want to say that I am absolutely delighted by this category

144
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:34,720
 and in particular by how many of the sort of games that I typically really like which are

145
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,360
 kind of slightly indie nerdy puzzle games have ended up on there or games that have got a lot of

146
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,160
 indie vibe going on with them that it has not ended up just being AAA games and it's really great.

147
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,520
 Yes. I mean obviously we love our AAA games equally. Yes so the only one of these games I have played

148
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:01,440
 is Dragon Age the Vale Guard which I would rate as like a B+ game but maybe a B-game in terms of

149
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,280
 Dragon Age and if anyone wants to discuss this in you know extensive detail I suggest you come

150
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,960
 and find me Eastercon and buy me pint. I have previously picked on the podcast I believe the

151
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:20,080
 Legend of Zelda, Echoes of Wisdom and Caves of Could both of which I enjoyed and I'm continuing

152
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:27,600
 to enjoy very much. There are three games here which are very much on my radar but which I haven't

153
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,080
 played because they're Windows games so I believe I can play them in emulation and I probably will

154
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,680
 do and I haven't I didn't even know Dragon Age the Vale Guard existed sorry it's so far off of

155
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,360
 why. It was your free PlayStation Plus game in March bafflingly given that it's an AAA game and it

156
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,560
 came out six months ago but it's worth a bite but I mean have you played the previous three games

157
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,320
 if you haven't then it may not make a lot of sense but yeah you can you can say that the Hugo

158
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,880
 voters are clearly like PC gamers I mean all right they've also nominated you know Legend of Zelda

159
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,760
 but there's some you know Windows only games on here it's not all you know PlayStation 5.

160
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,840
 There is one Windows only game which is tactical breach results all the others are available

161
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:19,040
 so Caves of Cud is available on Windows Mac and Linux. Dragon Age the Vale Guard is available on

162
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,040
 PlayStation Lorelai is available on Switch as is 1000 X resist and Legend of Zelda is also available

163
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,720
 on Switch so the only one which is Windows only is tactical breach wizards. What's I meant was

164
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,760
 not Mac? Yes Windows only and not Mac are two vastly different things when it comes to video

165
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,000
 games because almost everything is not Mac but almost everything is not Windows only.

166
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,960
 I'm throwing a floral eyeliner laser eyes it's now out on PlayStation it was not when I checked a

167
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,280
 few months ago because it came up seven months later for some reason. I think the only one I don't

168
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:57,040
 think will eventually end up on other platforms is um tactical breach wizards because none of their

169
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
 previous games have ever been ported to anything other than Windows. And also Zelda which will never

170
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,680
 be on anything apart from your Nintendo's. Indeed but yeah I think it's a good roster I've not

171
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,640
 played any of them and then we've got best dramatic presentation short form. In the category of best

172
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,160
 dramatic presentation short form we have Fallout at the beginning I get that all along Death's Hand

173
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,680
 in Mine. Dot two dot and bubble Star Trek Lowedex, Fisher Quest Star Trek Lowedex the new next

174
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,120
 generation and Dot two 73 yards. I've seen the Doctor Who's. You've seen some Doctor Who's.

175
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,000
 I've seen some Doctor Who's. You haven't seen Lowedex? Nope not yet. I haven't

176
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,680
 researched the Paramount Plus yet. Okay I thought you were like a Lowedex on the same day guy.

177
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:48,080
 I have seen Fallout. I enjoyed the series a lot and as did Stephen who has who had no familiarity

178
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,640
 with the Fallout Villier game series and all I thought I feel like it was a series that would

179
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,120
 probably land better for people who had seen who played the game or it does clearly stand alone.

180
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,000
 It feels like all of one thing. I feel like in many ways it would fit better into

181
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,640
 long form but you know it's very complicated. These episodes are not standalone. I've seen

182
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,560
 the Doctor Who's and the Lowedex. I quite liked them. I mean I gave up on Dot two for a while

183
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,600
 and then I got swept back in because it was also T. Debbie so I have seen those two and I did like

184
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,160
 both of them but I think Dot and Bubble is better and Fisher Quest is from Star Trek

185
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,440
 Lowedex's final series and the new next generation is the final episode and I did enjoy both of them.

186
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,520
 I don't know which one I would pick as a standout but yeah it seems a reasonable shortlist. I might

187
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,000
 get around to Agatha or along at some point when it's Disney+ time again which it will be shortly

188
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,400
 because of Andor. So the finalists for Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form are Dune Part 2, Flow,

189
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,600
 Furiosa and Mad Max Saga. I saw the TV Glow, Wicked Part 1 and The Wild Robot so I've seen

190
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,880
 the first four of those and I am excited to watch the last two as you saw Flow yesterday as we

191
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,680
 record in the cinema and I enjoyed it greatly but yeah I think this is another strong roster.

192
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,040
 I've only seen two of these movies and I did say what my nominations for this category would be

193
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,840
 in a previous episode of Octa the Upsun if you're interested you can run back. I'm very much hoping

194
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,080
 to see Flow in the cinema in the next week only because everyone says it's amazing because I have

195
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,040
 to say that as with the Wild Robot the trailer is indicated it was a film about cute animals which

196
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:46,000
 is very much not the sort of film I liked. I have seen Dune. That's it actually. I'm not very good at

197
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 getting into films. Some of these I'm going to pick up on streaming so hopefully I'll pick

198
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,040
 up. I do very much want to go and see Flow but it did not come out for very long here so I missed

199
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,400
 it and I'm not sure I saw the TV Glow advertise anywhere so I think that's why I missed that one.

200
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,000
 As to why I didn't go round to Wicked. I don't know I think I was sort of mentally like oh I'm

201
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,520
 going to wait until the second part's out because it seemed very long. It's finally a loved Wicked

202
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,240
 and I have not watched it yet but I'm sure I shall. I mean I've seen the musical. I have a hard time

203
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,280
 thinking why they would want to make it into two longer films rather than like one reasonably

204
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,920
 links film but I will wait and see. I would say I didn't feel that the I didn't feel it dragged at

205
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,720
 all. I was thoroughly I thoroughly enjoyed the whole of the movie and you know it's very good

206
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:40,560
 at what it does. And then we have best related work. This category is always the most like the

207
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,000
 biggest mixture of stuff. So we've got Chiting the Cliff an investigation into the 2023 Hugo

208
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,720
 nomination statistics by Camestros Flapton and Heather Rose Jones. We've got r/fantisees 2024

209
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,000
 bingo reading challenge from Reddit. We've got the spectacular failure of the Star Wars hotel by

210
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,960
 Jenny Nicholson. We've got speculative whiteness science fiction and the alt-right by Jordan S.

211
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,680
 Carroll track changes by Abigail Nussbaum and the 2023 Hugo Awards are a report on censorship and

212
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:17,120
 exclusion by Chris M. Barkley and Jason Sanford. So it's a mix of world-con drama Star Wars Reddit

213
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,360
 and criticism. I mean it's always a bit of a part of this one. Yes. It's going to be really hard to

214
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,040
 judge the Reddit fantasy 2024 bingo reading challenge because it's like it's a bingo card and you do a

215
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,960
 reading challenge off it. I just don't know what I'm judging. Am I judging the bingo card? Am I judging

216
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,080
 that people manage to make a bingo on it? It's one of those things that like it's going to be

217
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,120
 difficult. I feel like it's I don't I mean I'll let them speak for themselves but I feel like this is

218
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,360
 something that's a bit like what was the game? Plaza ball. That was where the what you were really

219
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,880
 celebrating was the community that arose around the thing and and the bingo challenge is a very big

220
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,360
 thing in Reddit fantasy and but it's been going for 10 years. So I don't know if I don't know if

221
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
 they've been trying to get to on the ballot for 10 years or this is something that they've just

222
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,000
 kind of drawn attention to. I'm very glad to know it exists because in in another part of the forest

223
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,800
 for board games I absolutely love to be board games challenges particularly once the two are a little

224
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:25,840
 bit scavenger hunting and I feel like that could be a way to direct reading in a in a very amusing

225
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,320
 and fun way. But this is the this is the wild card on the Hugo ballot this year I think. Yeah I mean

226
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,320
 there's two you know there's there's one book of criticism by Abigail Nussbaum and there's one

227
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,600
 X and book which is linking you know the history of science fiction and right wing politics especially

228
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,840
 like the new alt-right and they're both very good and so I'm almost certainly going to put one of

229
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,560
 those at the top of my ballot and I will get round to the Star Wars hotel video at some point it's

230
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,880
 just the four hours has put me off but I do actually want to watch that. If she'd split it into four

231
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,040
 one-hour episodes it would have been eligible in forecast for in fact. Um might be professional.

232
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,240
 Yeah surely Jenny Nicholson's professional. Professional YouTuber. She got 61,000 Patreon

233
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,840
 subscribers or you can join for free but yeah I suspect it's probably pro I think it's a full

234
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,960
 tan thing. Yeah she has 1.31 million subscribers on YouTuber I feel like she's making a living from it.

235
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,760
 Uh in the category of Best Graphic Story or Comic uh the nominees are The Deep Dark by Molly Knox

236
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,160
 Ostertag, The Hunger and the Dusk Vol 1 by Gee Willow Wilson and Chris Wild Goose,

237
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:42,480
 Monstrus Vol 9 The Possessed by Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda. My favorite thing is Monsters Vol 2

238
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,200
 by Emile Ferris. Star Trek Lower Decks Warp Your Own Way by Ryan North and Chris Finoglio and

239
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,840
 We Called Them Giants by Kieran Gillan and Stephanie Hance. So that is a roster of things I have not

240
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:03,600
 read but at least two of them I already own and am waiting to read and the others are exciting.

241
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:11,280
 I think Monstrus has been nominated before. I think my favorite thing is Monsters was nominated

242
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,640
 for Volume 1 but all the others I believe are first-time nominees. Although I don't know like

243
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,320
 obviously some of those authors and artists may have been on previous nomin- uh previous finalists but

244
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,280
 like they're all standalones or volume ones so yeah cool stuff. I am very excited about

245
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,240
 Warp Your Own Way which I haven't read yet but it's very much in my wheelhouse as the sort of thing

246
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,040
 that ticks a lot of different buttons for me. Yeah Monstrus has been nominated seven times

247
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:46,560
 previously and one three times previously I think. Yep so that is a definite repeat nominee

248
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:52,000
 whereas yes the the first volume of my favorite thing is Monsters was nominated. I think some of

249
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,040
 the others are first-time nominees so I don't think like Ryan North and Chris Van Olio who wrote

250
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,480
 Star Trek Lower Jax Warp Your Own Way are I think they're both first-time nominees although

251
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,560
 many of you will have read Dinosaur Comics obviously and yeah we call them Giants Kieran Gillan's

252
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:15,520
 previous nominee and possibly Stephanie Hance for some of the art from previous Kieran Gillan

253
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,400
 projects maybe. Depends which volumes of the Wicked and the Divine were nominated

254
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,120
 but she might be a first-time nominee. I believe the whole of uh Wicked and Divine was

255
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:32,960
 nominated as like a single work wasn't it? No no according to the internet. But I will say

256
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,760
 Stephanie Hance is definitely a repeat finalist because Dye was definitely a finalist in previous

257
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,560
 years. Ah yes that's it yeah and Dye has been nominated three times so yes and then we move on

258
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,800
 we are now on to the uh written fiction categories and so we have Best Series and the nominees are

259
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,960
 Between Earth and Sky by Rebecca Roanhalls, The Burning Kings by Tasha Suri, encrypted by Sean

260
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,440
 McGuire, Southern meets by Jeff Vandermeer, Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson and The Time

261
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,320
 Final Asifers by Agent Tchaikovsky. Regular listeners will know which one of those makes me extremely

262
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,920
 excited and it is obviously the one by Agent Tchaikovsky but I have read the first volume of

263
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,800
 The Burning Kings by Tasha Suri when she was a guest runner, Eastagon and really liked it

264
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,280
 and there's two more. We did an episode on it for this very podcast. Do we do a whole episode?

265
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,120
 We definitely read and discussed it and I liked it and I have not got the other two volumes and now

266
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:32,800
 I likely will. As for the and Between Earth and Sky the first volume was You Go Momma Lated, was it not?

267
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,200
 The first volume of Between Earth and Sky by Rebecca Roanhalls was Black Sun which was nominated

268
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,960
 when it was out as a novel. Yes and yeah the Jeff Vandermeer Southern Reak is an interesting one

269
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,720
 because that was Annihilation and its two sequels which came out quite a while back and now there

270
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,880
 is a fourth volume. The whole lot is eligible as well as presumably that book being eligible

271
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,200
 in Best Novel. So yeah I'm right do I want to read the whole trilogy again to read the fourth one?

272
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,000
 I'm not sure. Listeners tell me if it stands alone. I don't know where we want to say this but

273
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,600
 wasn't the second volume of the turret philosophers eligible for the Hugo this year?

274
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,680
 Didn't actually make it onto the Best Novel Ballot. Also there were two books and the

275
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,520
 turret philosophers that were technically eligible for the Best Novel this year. I think it is not

276
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:28,480
 uncommon that things that make good series don't always end up in Best Novel. All of the books

277
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,720
 there's only so the first instalment of Between Earth and Sky was up for a Hugo as a novel

278
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,120
 but I believe none of the and I don't I can't remember about the early southern

279
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,320
 region of wars and Annihilation might have been on the ballot but I don't think there's ever been

280
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,680
 an encrypted novel a burning kingdom novel or a stormlight archive novel on the Hugo ballot.

281
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,800
 So it is not I think series rewards different writing to novel in general.

282
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,960
 I think that's true. Which one of reasons I quite like it and we discussed the Jasmine

283
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,280
 throwing by Tasha Siri in episode 52 whose Robert Piccardo and Liz is correct we didn't spend

284
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,720
 the whole episode on it. I don't think Jeff Fandome has been nominated for Best Novel before

285
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,920
 so interestingly Annihilation did not get on there. Oh interesting yeah so I think I think series

286
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,920
 does reward quite different things but I think in a way that I enjoy. Yes I was the best series

287
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:27,840
 of someone else to show. Sorry. We have Five Views of the Planet Tartarus by Rachel K Jones.

288
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,080
 We have Marginalea by Mary Robinette Coel. We have Stitched to Skin Like Family is by Nivo.

289
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,200
 We have Three Faces of a Beheading by Arcady Martine. We have We Will Teach You How to Read

290
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,560
 Pipe. We Will Teach You How to Read by Caroline M. Joachim and we have Why Don't We Just Kill

291
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:50,720
 The Kid in the Omeleth Hole by Isabelle J. Kim. Isabelle J. Kim was up for an astounding in

292
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,400
 2023 or 2032. Can't remember which listeners go look up I'm not checking. I think Isabelle

293
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,040
 J. Kim this might be their first nomination for fiction like in one of the fiction categories or

294
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,760
 they have been up for astounding. I think all the others are multiple time nominees before.

295
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,080
 Rachel K. Jones was nominated last year and I also did pick Five Views of Planet Tartarus which I

296
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,160
 think is a very effective bit of flash fiction so you can go and read that in about a minute

297
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,400
 and come back and give you views. I've read We Will Teach You How to Read We Will Teach You How to Read

298
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,440
 which I think yeah is also pretty solid and there's a lot of interesting things with the kind of

299
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,760
 formatting and structure. I have read Why Don't We Just Kill The Kid in the Omeleth Hole. It didn't

300
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,160
 it didn't work quite as well for me as it seems to have done for a lot of people online. It is

301
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:38,880
 basically sort of a modern remix almost of the ones who work away from Omeleth but yeah I didn't

302
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,760
 feel it had like I didn't it didn't feel like it adds a huge amount to me to the original story

303
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,560
 but I think it is very hard. It feels very hard to me to do anything if I try to remix such a

304
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:54,320
 classic story. I think it's very hard to make a success of it. I think this one just okay but

305
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,680
 doesn't really do it for me and I haven't read the other three yet. Yeah pretty good showing for

306
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:06,960
 Uncanny Magazine here. Yep. And in general actually it is a good showing for Uncanny Magazine and also

307
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,760
 Clotsworld does pretty well. I think Strange Horizons has one or two on this ballot. Yeah. Light speed

308
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,200
 has a couple which I was I like light speed. Yeah I find light speed really solid. It's kind of

309
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,360
 almost a shame there's no way you can actually put light speed as a magazine on the ballot with

310
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,600
 it being you know professionally not semi-prosine but I think it generally has for me one of the

311
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,680
 highest hit rates. Then we have Best Novel Let, The Brotherhood of Montague Sent Video by Thomas Hart,

312
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,080
 by Salt, by Seabylight of Stars, by Premier Mohammed. The Force This is Overlooking the Sea

313
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,160
 by Naomi Quitsa, Lake of Souls by Anne Lecky, Loneliness Universe by Eugenia Terrianta-Filou,

314
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:51,920
 and Signs of Life by Sarah Pinska. I've read I believe two of these. I have read The Brotherhood

315
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,560
 of Montague Sent Video by Thomas Hart and by Salt by Seabylight of Stars by Premier Mohammed which

316
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,520
 I did both like. I think Thomas Hart had multiple eligible stories maybe not all in Best Novel Let

317
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,480
 this year but I like pretty much all of them. Premier Mohammed very solid novel The Siege of

318
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,640
 Burning Grass out last year but this is a good a good novel let all about a wizard and a wizard's

319
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,560
 apprentice. I haven't read the others yet but probably will be the Anne Lecky collection and

320
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,680
 yeah again they're all like solid names I recognize as short fiction writers. I think Eugenia

321
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:31,120
 Dranta-Filou is a first time nominee. The finalists in Best Novela are The Brides of High Hill by

322
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,760
 Nivo, The Butcher of the Forest by Premier Mohammed, navigational entanglements by Alliette Bodard,

323
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:44,720
 The Practice of the Horizon in the Chain by Sophia Samatar, The Tux of Extinction by Ray Naylor,

324
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:52,320
 and What Feasts at Night by T. Kingfisher. And five of these are Tour.com and one of them is

325
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,040
 Tour Nightfire so I feel like we've um because last year I think we had a few that were Tour.com

326
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:06,640
 but this is really cool Tour.com again. Well done Tour for championing the Nivella in a way that is

327
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,440
 really very commendable. Nivella is a great length for science fiction and fantasy stories as we know

328
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,360
 and although I have not in fact read any of these Nivellas I am very excited to because they

329
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,080
 several authors I like very much are represented still this list. Yeah I haven't read any of them

330
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:29,040
 but I confess I basically was expecting at least The Brides of High Hill by Nivo which is another

331
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:37,840
 in the series called The Singing Hills. Yes yeah so I was expecting The Brides of High Hill by Nivo

332
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,520
 which is another one in the Singing Hills series and definitely like The Practice of the Horizon

333
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,640
 in the Chain to be nominated so I may have kind of thought when I could read them now but I'm

334
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,280
 probably going to get them in the Hugo Vota packet anyway. I am so I haven't read any of these but I

335
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,800
 did read two of the Neon Hemlock Nivellas last year and I was really hoping at least one of those

336
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,040
 would make it on because I think that's another it's a small press which is having a go at having

337
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:07,040
 a really solid Nivella line and I think it's a shame they can't kind of get any awards traction

338
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,320
 so yeah I know that awards don't make and break necessary make and break it but it will be nice

339
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,600
 I could just get one on there but yeah one of the Neon Hemlock Nivellas actually when I didn't

340
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,760
 read the Drang Phragamba is on the the Nebula list which also has Countess Bices and Polumbo so that

341
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:30,800
 you know there are a couple of non-tour.com books on the Nebula Nivella list. I don't think I've

342
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:38,080
 read any of these but I've enjoyed previous Nivo Nivellas and I've enjoyed the works by all of

343
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,520
 the finalists I think so I am excited to read these Nivellas and then we have the category of

344
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:53,520
 Best Novel and we have Alien Clay by Adrian Tchaikovsky the Ministry of Time by Calliam Bradley

345
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,800
 Service Model by Adrian Tchaikovsky someone you can build a nest in by John Whizwell a

346
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,520
 sorceress comes to call by T. Kingfisher and The Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennett and I don't

347
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:11,120
 think I'm giving much away by saying that we're pretty delighted by this roster of Best Novels

348
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:19,920
 I think peeps is that is that fair two Tchaikovsky's and a couple of previous picks on the pod so yeah

349
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,360
 congratulations to Adrian Tchaikovsky for having two nominations in novel which has not been done

350
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:33,840
 since Robert Silverberg in 1973 so yeah look at that fact good lord that's 50 years yeah I guess

351
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:40,320
 this is the point where I can say that of course Adrian is also nominated for is also a finalist

352
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,920
 for Best Series and both of the books in Best Series were first published in 2024 in the US I

353
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:55,200
 believe no one was published in 24 in the US and one was 20 will be 2025 in the US although I haven't

354
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,040
 read the Ursula Vernon or the John Whizwell I will say I don't think I've read anything I didn't like

355
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,920
 by either Ursula Vernon or Charles Whizwell so you know T. Kingfisher I was listening to a podcast

356
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,120
 the other day in and it was an episode of The Incompromable Game Show specifically inconceivable

357
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:20,640
 hosted by Dan Moran which is very good I highly recommend Friend of Liz Liz Miles found out live

358
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,680
 on the podcast that T. Kingfisher and Ursula Vernon were the same person and it is very delightful to

359
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,920
 listen to people finding that news out for the first time so I do think it is sometimes worth

360
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,240
 just highlighting because I don't think everyone knows that's true but T. Kingfisher I believe is

361
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:42,800
 Ursula Vernon's adult pen name for more adult works so yeah but they're the same person oh that is

362
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,400
 fascinating what is fascinating I like because I'm sure that I saw Liz Miles like in 2019 at the

363
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,720
 Hugo Awards when T. Kingfisher was nominated there's so much stuff I can't know all the stuff that is

364
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,280
 true that is true but yes so I have read one of the agent T. Kofsky's and I've read the Ministry

365
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,520
 of Time and I've read the Tainty Cup and if you made me pick which one I'm gonna put at the top of my

366
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,280
 ballot I'm just gonna go in a corner and go I don't know yet and yeah maybe one of the other three

367
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,840
 will actually be better who knows we're gonna find out I don't know if we'll be able to do our

368
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:23,360
 customary Hugo finalists episode this year I'll just do a monologue be fine we love all our

369
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:29,520
 finalists equally this is a very strong Hugo list a very strong novel it's a very strong list I think

370
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:41,440
 this is the first time we have had three men in the best novelist since 2018 this is a very

371
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:50,560
 egalitarian list in that regard but yeah no it is notable well no hang on but and and four works

372
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:57,440
 by men as well yeah no no the majority of works written by men which is unusual for the Hugo's

373
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,240
 these days yes yeah I don't think that has happened since like it's hard because it hasn't happened

374
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:11,920
 since we went up to six finalists one also it stands in stark contrast to best short story which is

375
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:20,240
 all women best novella and best novellette I believe have one man each and then best series is

376
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,560
 half and half men and women yeah interesting I didn't hear a lot about a source comes to call

377
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,840
 whereas I had heard quite a bit about the other five books on the ballot but I think this may just

378
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,360
 be that like teaking vicious novels are so solid that they're just getting a ton of nominations

379
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,560
 every time she writes one hmm she's very good there's not a lot of crossover with the nebulas

380
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:50,000
 there's two novels nominated for both Hugo and Nebula there's a bit more crossover in

381
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,560
 in novella where there's three denominator both but yeah not kind of not a lot of crossover with

382
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:04,800
 those other other awards this year I am interested in the goodreads because the goodreads awards are

383
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,120
 also a user voted award right and the Ministry of Time won their science fiction award but none of

384
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:19,840
 the other books appearing at the top of these are a sorceress came to call was 12th in fantasy

385
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:27,040
 looking at this do you think the fact that Glasgow members had the opportunity to nominate

386
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,920
 had an effect on this list yes because I think it is a somewhat more um British and European

387
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,080
 list than it would have been if it was exclusively Seattle members I think I think as evidenced by

388
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,880
 the fact that we were discussing the um the editor from rebellion David Thomas Moore

389
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,120
 who got their first nomination last year and is a repeat finalist this year um and yeah I wonder

390
00:38:53,120 --> 00:39:00,080
 whether Adrian Tricowski has benefited from a British although I think Tricowski's star is rising in

391
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:06,240
 the US so that might not be true the other the other categories don't seem particularly British to me

392
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,320
 maybe Tasha's Siri has benefited a little bit from that because she is obviously British as well

393
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,320
 but I can't see any other names where I'm like oh that's interesting maybe Abigail Nussbaum

394
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,640
 invest fan writer because although she's not British she's very popular in the UK and maybe

395
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,320
 Rosanna Pendelpre and best is she in best related work as well she is in best related work I think

396
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,680
 related work yeah I don't know it'll be interesting to see whether color fields by Paul Kincaid ends up

397
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,120
 on the ballot next year when it's an entirely US nominating Paul but I wonder whether Breyer

398
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:48,240
 Dean books has benefited from British nominators I think Abigail has a large fan base and geographically

399
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,480
 dispersed fan base and I think I mean I think Paul Kincaid is well known in the criticism field

400
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,600
 but I suspect he's better known still in the UK and you know Abigail has things like the

401
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,960
 column on Lois Gens and Money and so on I think he's just got a lot more accessible online

402
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:12,160
 which probably helps in fan writer but it will be interesting to see yeah so that was the Hugo

403
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,920
 award finalist congratulations to everyone and that was the Oct Thought podcast and it's goodbye

404
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:33,840
 for me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

405
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:46,400
 we haven't done letters of comment this week because we recorded early but we've

406
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,520
 recorded a little pick up because we made some vital

407
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:57,600
 errors with regards to handwriting so firstly we didn't offer to buy Doug Fawn half a pint

408
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,920
 so Doug we will get you half a pint at the Dublin Worldcon and for those who didn't know

409
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,480
 there's a bid for a Dublin Worldcon in 2029 because that was a question that was asked on

410
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:16,160
 our Facebook group in reaction to Doug's suggestion and Raj notes that he correctly guessed

411
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,320
 all three of our handwriting on blue sky so I said we'd buy him a point of his choice

412
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,600
 and Raj does not drink so we are buying him a pint of tea well the bar do a pint of tea do you

413
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,800
 have any idea how much that bar's likely to charge for a pint of tea don't know we're going to find

414
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:39,760
 out I mean I can always just bring a thermos yeah that sounds good I mean it's basically just

415
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,920
 a tea and then a buy a pint of milk right and we put it on the glass to make a he's concoction

416
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,800
 classically it's a pint of hot water with a tea bag I can bring the tea bag hi Raj yeah

417
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:59,680
 yes indeed the theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin McLeod in
