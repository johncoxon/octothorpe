1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,220
Where's our style guide, John?

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,500
It's in the shared folder. It's called Octothorpe Style Guide.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,540
Oh, actually, I thought, okay.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,320
You called my bluff, Liz, and I was ready for you.

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,940
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the very 147th episode of Octothorpe,

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,780
which is finishing its brain surgery with Jeff Goldblum and making its way to the test track

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,020
on the 6th of November, 2025. I'm John Coxon.

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,900
I'm Alison Scott.

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,040
And I'm Liz Batty.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,580
Can you tell I watched Buckaroo Banzai last night?

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:48,940
No.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,820
Ah, never seen that, so no.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,380
This episode is coming to you the day before the start of

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:55,940
No.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,180
V.

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,240
V.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,620
Con.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,100
So this is perfect listening for people who are doing that travelling.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,340
And we will see you there, listeners.

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,060
Yeah, if you want to catch up on all the Octothorpe lore so that you are, you know,

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,440
sufficiently educated for the live podcast and not missing out on any inside jokes,

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,280
then, yeah, you've got to get going.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,620
You've not got long, but we won't have any inside jokes at Nevercon.

24
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,520
Probably.

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,620
Liz, are you still incandescent with rage that you're going to miss our live

26
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:25,860
podcast?

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,580
Octothorpe?

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,260
I absolutely am, John.

29
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,200
Fair enough.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,340
But I will let you have credit for that joke.

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,960
So we are on, I think, on the Sunday morning.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,440
So we will see everyone then.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,660
But yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,000
Be good.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,800
And you know, if you don't go to Eastercon, we can make the same.

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, no, that's iridescent.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
You'd be iridescent with rage.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,000
Sorry, I'm not making any sense.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,800
Well, also, I don't think that Stunt Liz has ever written a book called Iridescent.

40
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,820
No, I know.

41
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,620
I am not iridescent, as far as we know.

42
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,280
It took a lot of self-control not to call the previous episode iridescent.

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,680
But I exercise discretion.

44
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,320
We have some letters of comment from all of you lovely people.

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,780
And I'm going to start with Raj.

46
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,180
This is a letter of comment on the Tommy Ferguson episode.

47
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,480
That's 145 listeners, because we recorded the follow-up episode very quickly.

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,060
And so.

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,360
There are some letters on that one.

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,320
So Raj says that he really enjoyed having Tommy Ferguson as Stunt Liz.

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,460
And given that most people seem to run a con and then run a mile,

52
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,620
it was brilliant to hear Tommy's enthusiasm for continuing to run cons.

53
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,660
And after show, I'm sure she didn't mean it that way,

54
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,880
but it really sounded like Alison was arguing in favor of cruelty to animals.

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,580
I don't think she was.

56
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,300
What?

57
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,860
What?

58
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,960
No.

59
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,060
But he does follow up with,

60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,840
he owns a copy of the Abyss on DVD and it's classified by the BBFC as a 15.

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
And I think,

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,940
I think Cameron did compromise on the previous home release and is refusing to compromise on this one.

63
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,040
It was cut.

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,700
Yeah.

65
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,720
There is an extant UK DVD version that does not have the scene.

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
But if you want to see it in high quality,

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,340
then you will not be able to get a legal UK copy.

68
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,240
Although follow up to that.

69
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,040
Apparently the 4K version is like lazily AI,

70
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,020
upscaled.

71
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,660
If you Google it,

72
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,840
there are lots of film fans who are very angry about the quality of the,

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,820
of the restoration.

74
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,340
So,

75
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,600
which is weird given how anal Cameron is about the qualities of his works.

76
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,660
You'd think he would have not done that,

77
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,640
but I don't know.

78
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,160
Hmm.

79
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,040
It was also cut for its original cinema release.

80
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,620
So I did not see that film.

81
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,120
I did not see the rat scene in the cinema.

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,580
I think I've since seen it on YouTube.

83
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,600
So there you have it,

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:48,880
Raj.

85
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,940
Alison just watches Animal Cruelty on YouTube.

86
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,240
That's the.

87
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,900
Well,

88
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:55,700
no,

89
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,720
I'm teasing.

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,180
I'm teasing.

91
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,840
I do not think I do not seriously believe Alison is in favour of Animal Cruelty,

92
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,200
or I would not have made the joke.

93
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,760
Well,

94
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:02,980
I mean,

95
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,960
I like eating animals.

96
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,120
There's a whole,

97
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,360
whole thing there.

98
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Vegetarians don't write in.

99
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,980
It just showed the weirdness now of like the BBFC in that they can say,

100
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,300
no,

101
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,760
this is something that you will never allow to be released on DVD.

102
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,000
But Alison's watched it on YouTube.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,660
Well,

104
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,500
you know,

105
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,020
it's the dark web in it.

106
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,200
YouTube is not the dark web.

107
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,500
It's just the web.

108
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,480
Thank you very much for writing in Raj.

109
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,380
We got a letter from Paul Weimer who quotes me saying,

110
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,500
he actually quotes me verbatim,

111
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,520
which means I know how much I say like,

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,100
and you know now,

113
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,700
but I said basically that maybe if comms only have about $20,000 left,

114
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,540
they should just submit a final report and be done.

115
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,700
And Paul says that 20K is a lot of money and maybe that's super not great.

116
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,100
Yeah,

117
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,740
I can kind of also take that view,

118
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,880
but I'm also kind of going,

119
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,840
well,

120
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,420
by this point,

121
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,220
we've trusted them.

122
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,260
We've done stuff with many,

123
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,760
many hundreds of thousands of dollars.

124
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,920
So I'm prepared to give him a bit of a pass on the last 20K.

125
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,460
But then again,

126
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,300
if there's a comm that doesn't,

127
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,820
we don't think has done good stuff with our hundreds of thousands of dollars,

128
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,000
then maybe that's a good rationale for not just letting them,

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,280
you know,

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,000
stop doing reports.

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,260
And I think you have to bear in mind that 20,000 pounds or $20,000,

132
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,800
20,000 monetary units.

133
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,100
To me,

134
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,460
that's loads of money,

135
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,800
but to a world comm with a budget of like a million and a half dollars,

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,220
it's about a percent of their,

137
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,220
like money.

138
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,800
Most world comms are bringing in over a million dollars in revenue.

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
And so it sounds like a lot of money,

140
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,160
but I do think it is important to bear in mind that it is 1% of the budget.

141
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,740
So it's not to say that I think Paul's wrong,

142
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,900
but I don't think,

143
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,640
I think also you had more of a point than Paul gives you credit for in his

144
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,180
log.

145
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,700
I think.

146
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Although he does mention that,

147
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:48,940
you know,

148
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,360
his jaw hit the floor when I said that con Zealand had 140,000 pounds.

149
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,120
I think the other point here is that if,

150
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,380
people,

151
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,880
when people are submitting reports,

152
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,520
very few people are reading them.

153
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,120
So very few people actually are paying any attention to what's going on.

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,580
Yeah.

155
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,220
That's the other thing,

156
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,440
right?

157
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,720
If we hadn't reported,

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,680
no one would have.

159
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,200
I mean,

160
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,820
there are people who do read this stuff,

161
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,100
but they're all called Liz.

162
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,680
No,

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:09,920
no.

164
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,960
Some of them are called Claire.

165
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,640
Yes,

166
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,020
it's true.

167
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,220
I wanted to pick up a comment from Terry Gibbs on Facebook in connection with

168
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,540
this,

169
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,300
who says,

170
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,340
I have been amazed at considering the size of money involved accounting for it

171
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,640
seems a little relaxed.

172
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,620
And so first of all,

173
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:28,940
Terry,

174
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,380
you have a wild faith in more formal accounting,

175
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,940
which is also extremely good at not letting people see money that they're not

176
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,240
interested in people seeing,

177
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,220
you know,

178
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,500
it,

179
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,040
the relax.

180
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,600
The fact that the accounting is relaxed is not the problem.

181
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,940
The fact that nobody cares,

182
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,660
nobody seems to pay very much attention might be a problem.

183
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,060
I mean,

184
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,480
as long as a few people pay attention,

185
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,180
I think that's enough.

186
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,060
You don't need a lot of people to know.

187
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,620
I mean,

188
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,980
Northumbria is very transparent with its,

189
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,520
its finances.

190
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,560
There's like a briefing every year where the head accountant basically goes through all the money means.

191
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,420
And he keeps having to say stuff like this.

192
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,720
This,

193
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,980
these numbers don't add up.

194
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,680
And the reason they don't add up is because of how we do it in accounting.

195
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,220
And I know it's confusing,

196
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,200
but the reason we do it this way in accounting is to confuse people.

197
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,320
And so I'm doing my best to D confuse you.

198
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,140
And,

199
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,540
and,

200
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,260
Oh,

201
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,120
that last bit's not entirely fair.

202
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,280
No,

203
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,900
but I think if you're an accountant trying to explain accounting things to non accountants,

204
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,240
it can be helpful to be like,

205
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,600
I know that this is,

206
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,400
this appears to be nonsense and it isn't nonsense,

207
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
but you're going to have to go with me on the journey for why.

208
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,120
So,

209
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,540
I mean,

210
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,220
I'm a physicist and I don't understand accounting.

211
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,380
Like I have a PhD in physics,

212
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,980
but I don't understand physics.

213
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,200
So,

214
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,480
you know,

215
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,060
I mean,

216
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,660
and lots of people don't understand physics.

217
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,080
And,

218
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,400
um,

219
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,740
seeing as I have twice in my life sat in a room saying everything you've previously learned about physics is wrong.

220
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,860
And let me explain why.

221
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,640
Oh,

222
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,900
but that's also true of accounting.

223
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,020
Um,

224
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,700
but point,

225
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,080
point,

226
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,420
point.

227
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah,

228
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,340
I think,

229
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,820
I think,

230
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,900
I think accounting is complicated and I don't think I,

231
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,240
I,

232
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,340
yeah,

233
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,500
I don't,

234
00:07:59,500 --> 00:07:59,740
we,

235
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,280
it would be,

236
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,860
actually,

237
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,200
you know,

238
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,440
who would have been a good person to talk to about all this stuff,

239
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,680
Liz?

240
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,540
Tommy Ferguson on account of his professional background.

241
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,720
So maybe we should have Tommy back like as a fourth member,

242
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,700
because it might actually be interesting to talk about this with someone who understands more of the professional aspect of it.

243
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,400
I live with an accountant and I am not entirely sure that's true.

244
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,420
Uh,

245
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,020
yes.

246
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:24,980
And,

247
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,300
um,

248
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,100
and my daughter is about to be a tax accountant,

249
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,620
which is kind of related.

250
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,320
So,

251
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,140
um,

252
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:35,780
Terry Gibbs also says Brisbane in 2028 may rely heavily on the parcel long,

253
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,140
having an idea of how much that might be could have a bearing on their plans.

254
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,720
I think the kind of point about parcel long is that you don't know how much is going to be until after you've run the convention.

255
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,380
Um,

256
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,140
cause it's,

257
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,480
it's what you've got left over.

258
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,040
Yeah.

259
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,440
I mean,

260
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,660
I was going to say that the other thing is I am not an accountant and my accountancy skills go about as far as,

261
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,660
doing my own taxes.

262
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,520
So there's entirely possible that there's things I'm completely missing in the accounts from WorldCom.

263
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,280
Um,

264
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,640
but yes,

265
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,860
back to Paul,

266
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,400
who also says that,

267
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,780
uh,

268
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,500
he thinks Chengdu should make new statues,

269
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,300
all the money they have and personally deliver them,

270
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,340
especially to Chris Barkley.

271
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:16,180
Or maybe they can pay for a trip for Dave McCarty to visit Nepal so he can properly distinguish it from Tibet.

272
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,500
And I also want to say that Paul also left us a skeet of comment about his Nepal Tibet joke,

273
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,260
which has a nice picture of Nepal in.

274
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,340
So I will put it in the show notes.

275
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,180
Kev McVey says,

276
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,180
Kev McVey says,

277
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:54,260
Kev McVey says,

278
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,100
Kev McVey says,

279
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,140
Kev McVey says,

280
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,180
Kev McVey says,

281
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,200
Kev McVey says,

282
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,240
Kev McVey says,

283
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,300
Kev McVey says,

284
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,320
Kev McVey says,

285
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,360
Kev McVey says,

286
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,420
Kev McVey says,

287
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,440
Kev McVey says,

288
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,480
Kev McVey says,

289
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,500
Kev McVey says,

290
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,520
Kev McVey says,

291
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:57,540
Kev McVey says,

292
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:57,560
Kev McVey says,

293
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,060
I could have tried to find parties,

294
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,460
but I was tired from traveling and a bit anxious of the crowds.

295
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,240
I did enjoy the con,

296
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,020
but it was much more of a solo experience rather than the community I'm used to.

297
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,260
So I'm wondering what could help people who aren't new,

298
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,240
but have maybe had a break or mostly only been to different conventions,

299
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,420
different styles of conventions.

300
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,600
The first world con type panel wouldn't normally attract me,

301
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,480
but maybe it should have.

302
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,700
I thought this was good.

303
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,900
We're going to touch on other styles of cons a little bit later in the episode,

304
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,300
Kev,

305
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,240
which is actually completely coincidental to your lock,

306
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,820
but it ties in nicely.

307
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,280
But no,

308
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,500
I mean,

309
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,140
I think I found the same thing going to gaming conventions.

310
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,560
I'm less familiar with like going to air con felt very lonely in a way that

311
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,220
going to other gaming conventions and going to sci-fi conventions doesn't

312
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,680
for me.

313
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,200
One thing I've been trying to do with the discord is try and bridge this gap

314
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,140
so that people who are new to the community who are into discord can find

315
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,840
other people.

316
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,880
And I did hear from people at Glasgow that found my scavenger hunt.

317
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,360
And if we ran the con channels were very good in kind of giving them names to

318
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,640
look out for the conventions.

319
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,020
They'd be like,

320
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,340
you,

321
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,480
you're wrong about Fran.

322
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,820
Shout out to Frandom.

323
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,960
And so I think there are things we are trying to do,

324
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,980
but I do think this is an area we could always do more.

325
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,900
Like it wouldn't,

326
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,100
it's,

327
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,840
cause it's never going to be a solved problem because human social dynamics

328
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,280
are complicated.

329
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,060
And we talked about the icebreaker that Tommy did at core flu.

330
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,140
And in that case,

331
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,620
like it might not have been there as necessary.

332
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,420
Cause like core flu,

333
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,740
a lot of people know a lot of people,

334
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,420
but like,

335
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,060
I do think,

336
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,000
I do think this is something people are trying to do.

337
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,460
If listeners have any thoughts on how we could do it better,

338
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,160
do write in.

339
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,120
But I do,

340
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,760
the thing I wanted to pick up on was,

341
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,920
I think we do a very good job with people who are at their first world con,

342
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,020
but I don't think we do anything at all for people who are at their first world

343
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,180
con.

344
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,260
Since the last world con they went to in 1990,

345
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,220
like you don't get a first world con ribbon.

346
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,060
You don't get any,

347
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,440
like,

348
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,640
I wonder whether a returning,

349
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,520
like we have scholarships in,

350
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,080
in academia for people who have had a career break and are coming back.

351
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,420
And I wonder if we need to have an approach for people who have had a fan

352
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,240
break and are coming back.

353
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,060
What do we reckon?

354
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,420
I think that's quite good.

355
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,700
But it was very interesting.

356
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,300
Lock Kevin.

357
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,960
Thank you very much.

358
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,440
If you're one of those people,

359
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,560
right in,

360
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,000
let us know if you're coming to Easter con and you haven't been to a con for

361
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,160
30 years.

362
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,560
30 years.

363
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,300
We used to have a whole concept of the born again,

364
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,660
fifties fans who,

365
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,820
who returned to fandom in the eighties.

366
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,120
I think they'd left fandom to raise a family and then they returned or for

367
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,860
some other reason.

368
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,340
Well,

369
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:25,760
cause that,

370
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,620
that describes Tommy,

371
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,180
I think,

372
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,440
right?

373
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,360
Like we were talking about that with him two episodes ago and he very much

374
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,400
had that thing where he went away for a little bit and then came back in.

375
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,460
And I think it does,

376
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,080
you know,

377
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,800
life happens.

378
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,020
So yeah.

379
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,360
Yeah.

380
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
Carrie and Jim Moat,

381
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,620
I think,

382
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,300
yeah,

383
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,040
I think that's,

384
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,040
I think that's a really good idea because I think especially we do have a lot of

385
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,060
people who have taken time off to raise kids,

386
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,080
especially women.

387
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,440
And it's nice to give them kind of a,

388
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,820
a way back in when,

389
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,060
yeah,

390
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,380
you don't need someone to sit there and explain like,

391
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,280
Oh,

392
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,840
you should make sure to go and visit the dealer's room and know you should make

393
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,740
sure to get six hours of sleep or whatever,

394
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,440
but they might need a,

395
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh yeah.

396
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,680
Since you've left,

397
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
this thing has become really,

398
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,320
really popular.

399
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,760
And that's why everyone's got 27,000 badge ribbons now and that kind of thing.

400
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,280
Yeah.

401
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,120
And also,

402
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,420
there's a code of conduct now,

403
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,180
please read it.

404
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,320
I'm thinking of an example person who I won't name where we basically had to sit

405
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,020
down and explain how codes of conduct work now.

406
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,720
Yes.

407
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,820
Chris Garcia wrote to us.

408
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,480
It's not common,

409
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:23,860
is it?

410
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,240
He says,

411
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,400
I did not expect this to break down into a subjective experience versus

412
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,480
objective observed reality discussion.

413
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,540
And it was brief,

414
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,140
too brief.

415
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,100
I don't even remember doing this.

416
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:42,100
He says he's hoping to go to Corflu in Santa Rosa,

417
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,940
which is close enough that he can drive,

418
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,660
but also far enough that it's almost like the wilds of wine County,

419
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,240
wilds of wine country,

420
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,820
even.

421
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,480
Um,

422
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,160
yes.

423
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,080
Santa Rosa is also the hometown of Guy Fieri.

424
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,240
Flavor town.

425
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,480
Who's Guy Fieri?

426
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,340
Uh,

427
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,040
he's the American service chef.

428
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,400
He wears good shirts made of fire.

429
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,060
I just want to say that I like that Chris is,

430
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,580
uh,

431
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:11,500
Chris has experienced a reality in which we had a discussion of experiential reality versus objective reality.

432
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,080
And none of us have experienced a reality in which we had a discussion of experiential reality versus objective reality.

433
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,740
And none of us have had that experience because none of us remember it.

434
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,920
So his experience of reality and our experience of reality is different,

435
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,680
despite the fact there is an objective reality.

436
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,480
And,

437
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,880
uh,

438
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,080
Chris,

439
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,000
I hope this small addition to whatever discussion it might be that we had is good.

440
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,260
He reminisces of times that convention shared the same hotel saying the best ever was the Lego con with the steampunk convention.

441
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,300
That sounds great.

442
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,060
But he also had a great time at the convention at the same hotel as a Bollywood fan convention.

443
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,480
Also sounds great.

444
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,320
Which does indeed sound great.

445
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,860
Um,

446
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,380
and I can confirm that Bollywood beats are a good thing to drink to Chris.

447
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,560
He has a guess at how our stunt Liz is next week.

448
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,440
It's not a correct guest.

449
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,260
It is John Oliver,

450
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,820
but yes,

451
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,140
John will be great on the podcast.

452
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,800
If you're listening,

453
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,600
do do right in any time.

454
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,900
He does say,

455
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,300
um,

456
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,960
letting world cons hold on to cash over time is not a bad thing.

457
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,720
There is of course the argument that world cons shouldn't make profits to have to move around,

458
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,800
but that's a religious argument.

459
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I think it's also impossible in practice,

460
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,480
because you don't know if you're going to make profit until the last day of,

461
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,780
well,

462
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,440
until a week after the convention finishes.

463
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,680
I'm going to just do a tiny little accounting thing here,

464
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,300
which is that world cons don't make profit.

465
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,200
They make surpluses.

466
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,100
Ah,

467
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,380
yes.

468
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,060
No good point.

469
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,900
Hmm.

470
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,300
I think that's true everywhere for,

471
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,680
for fan round conventions.

472
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,560
Um,

473
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,580
and that's the issue actually,

474
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,160
is that they have surpluses that we need,

475
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,220
that they need to disperse,

476
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,920
make reasonably account for disperse.

477
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,640
Yes.

478
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,780
Anything you want to pull out?

479
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:41,980
Liz,

480
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,160
are you happy?

481
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,360
I am happy.

482
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,900
But we loved all of your lock,

483
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,180
Chris,

484
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,640
even though we don't read all of it out.

485
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,700
We also heard from Ed Morland,

486
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,420
who said,

487
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,500
may have to clip.

488
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:51,840
Thanks,

489
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,020
Ed.

490
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,020
You were right in order to play back,

491
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,540
uh,

492
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,360
when Rosanna is insufficiently appreciating my genius.

493
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,760
And he did footnote that,

494
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,100
but I won't read the footnotes because it's funnier.

495
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,760
Thank you,

496
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,000
Ed.

497
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,160
We have a similar,

498
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,680
there is a clip that exists for Liz,

499
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,460
which just says,

500
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,060
I agree with everything Liz said.

501
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,760
I'll try and work out if I can put that anywhere on the internet for the show notes.

502
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,160
Ming said two things.

503
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,420
The first is that he does not have a Steam deck.

504
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,240
Um,

505
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,900
I'm sorry for maligning you,

506
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,080
Ming,

507
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,560
but instead has an Asus ROG ally,

508
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,320
which I have never heard of,

509
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,520
but Ming has a lot of tech I've never heard of.

510
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,340
So that's not terribly surprising.

511
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,700
A PC based gaming,

512
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,920
handheld gaming console.

513
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,460
So ROG stands for,

514
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,080
if I'm not very much mistaken,

515
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,400
Republic of Gamers.

516
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,040
Uh,

517
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,740
and it's the Asus gaming brand.

518
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,740
We heard from Finbar,

519
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,260
O'Reilly,

520
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,960
um,

521
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,660
who was listening while waiting,

522
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,260
uh,

523
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,240
for the techs,

524
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,500
uh,

525
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,120
Octagon sort out streaming.

526
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,080
Um,

527
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,520
I hope that went well.

528
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,120
Uh,

529
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,200
Octagon's very,

530
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,600
um,

531
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,280
tech forward and I really respect that about them.

532
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,880
So I'm sure it did.

533
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,580
Finbar says that they agree with me and Tommy that social media is helpful as an attendee.

534
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,400
And that was,

535
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
was something we briefly mentioned during Kev's lock.

536
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,100
Um,

537
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,760
and it's especially true for people attending remotely.

538
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,960
And then asks,

539
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,700
while acknowledging the most cons of,

540
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,640
volunteer run and that Murphy's law applies to tech equipment everywhere.

541
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,140
What more could cons be doing to head off streaming issues at conventions?

542
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,660
I think this is a complicated question.

543
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:28,600
I think ultimately the thing we would need to do to head off streaming issues is to start trying to stream a day earlier with test streams.

544
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:36,600
But the cost of hiring the venue in advance to do that is prohibitive for our style of convention.

545
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,160
Yeah.

546
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,260
I think we are slowly accumulating ways in which your tech,

547
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,820
streaming can fail,

548
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,600
right?

549
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,960
Like insufficient bandwidth or things aren't,

550
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,160
we,

551
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,120
we don't have the,

552
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,260
the hardwired links or there's no one who can run the stream on an overly complicated backend or things like that.

553
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:02,520
So I think we're probably gradually accumulating like the sort of knowledge that we have in all the other areas of how to do stuff.

554
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,340
But we've started later,

555
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,260
so it's taking a bit longer.

556
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,280
And then the problem is that you just get like either a brand new problem that no one ever anticipated,

557
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,260
or,

558
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,060
we thought you'd sorted something out with an external vendor or the hotel or whatever.

559
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,000
And it turns out it didn't happen.

560
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,400
And that is the tricky one.

561
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,320
I think like,

562
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm sure that like Seattle's problems with streaming bandwidth were something they thought they had discussed and had us fix for.

563
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,620
And then when you get there and you find that you don't,

564
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,020
there's not,

565
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,880
you're now at a very late stage to fix that.

566
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,560
I think I would agree.

567
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,680
I think we do do as much as we possibly can is the other thing.

568
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:37,880
Like,

569
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,380
I don't think this is something that we're like resting on our laurels around.

570
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,760
But I think even in like,

571
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,440
you know,

572
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,700
Easter cons do not like maybe have a completely standard setup that you can deploy.

573
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:49,960
Like,

574
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,240
you know,

575
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,180
the art show is like,

576
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,320
well,

577
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,960
everyone knows this is how the art show works.

578
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
And this is how all the bits fit together.

579
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,520
And this is what you have to do.

580
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,320
And so on and so forth.

581
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,740
We are not really at that sort of stage of like,

582
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,880
you plug it in and it works.

583
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,060
Yeah.

584
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,520
Maybe we're not for the art show anymore.

585
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,780
I haven't done an art show for a long time.

586
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:11,640
So I would say one thing I think about streaming is the fact that we are kind of still figuring out how it works means that maybe we are still incorporating it.

587
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,800
We're still incorporating advancements and new technology.

588
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,400
And maybe there are areas of con running where we should be adding some new stuff in,

589
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,820
but we've kind of got too used to how it works.

590
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,100
And we're not future discussion there.

591
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,000
Ah,

592
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,880
I think that's a very good point.

593
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,240
And I think,

594
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,400
I think it is.

595
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,700
I think that is one of the reasons why we are still trying to iron out the bugs is probably because we know there are still bugs.

596
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,620
And it's not as clear with stuff that's been working for a long time when bugs like gets introduced.

597
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,300
I think that's an interesting point.

598
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,120
All right.

599
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,100
I'm going to do one last lock and then let's move out of the letters section.

600
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,000
And that is,

601
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,920
thank you very much to Farah Mendelsohn for writing in.

602
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,900
Picked con two will be in Perth on the 17th of October,

603
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,120
2026.

604
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:09,660
Shall we discuss the Ursula K.

605
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,900
Le Guin award,

606
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,420
Liz?

607
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:11,740
Yes,

608
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,160
because I put this in the show notes for two reasons.

609
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,000
One is that the Ursula K.

610
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,540
Le Guin award winner was announced and it is Rake's Fall by Vajra Chandrasekara,

611
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,520
which means that I'm even more determined to get round to it.

612
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,720
Yup.

613
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,060
Fair,

614
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,360
fair.

615
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,820
I own it.

616
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,300
Having read like the same to Bright Doors and read lots of reviews of Rake's Fall,

617
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,380
I know I'm going to need like maximum brain power.

618
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,740
So I've been saving up for a special occasion and then haven't read it yet,

619
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,260
but I will be reading it.

620
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,260
Are you saying that you've got books in your house that you haven't read?

621
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,580
That's monstrous.

622
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,500
Yeah,

623
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,900
I've got a Kindle,

624
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,160
John.

625
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:57,020
I can have functionally almost infinite books I haven't read.

626
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,520
And I do have functionally infinite books I haven't read.

627
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,340
I've got several hundred.

628
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,760
I mean,

629
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,800
but this is one I'm definitely going to get round to reading.

630
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,120
The other thing is that we will put a link to the announcement in the show notes.

631
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,080
But I think the really nice thing they did is that,

632
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,960
the actor Eben Moss-Bachrach,

633
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,780
when he was asked during the promo tour for the Fantastic Four,

634
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,100
who would be in his personal Fantastic Four,

635
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,080
picked,

636
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,260
I think,

637
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,840
fair to say,

638
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,000
slightly unexpectedly for the rest of the internet,

639
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,860
Ursula K. Le Guin.

640
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,880
And so they got him to come and announce the award,

641
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,000
which is just kind of cool.

642
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,300
And a really nice way to kind of bounce off that very unexpected little bit of publicity

643
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,660
that Le Guin got from being picked as his personal Fantastic Four.

644
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,940
So that's pretty cool.

645
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,440
Well, and what's hilarious,

646
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,940
because I remember it happening,

647
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,100
and I remember that the other three people,

648
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,140
so Pedro Pascal,

649
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,660
Joe Quinn,

650
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,140
and Vanessa Kirby all said like,

651
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,540
oh,

652
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,000
the cast is my Fantastic Four,

653
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,680
my family.

654
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,900
And Eben Moss-Bachrach just went,

655
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,240
no,

656
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,580
it is these four people.

657
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,960
I've thought about this.

658
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,460
It was clearly like,

659
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,160
there was no,

660
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,620
on the red,

661
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,420
if you watch the video,

662
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,400
I'll link it in the show notes.

663
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,900
The video of him on the red carpet is also very good.

664
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,560
But yeah,

665
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,240
it's good.

666
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,200
It is good.

667
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,360
I presume like the whole cast had been primed that,

668
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,660
look,

669
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,500
this is an obvious question.

670
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,380
You're going to get it.

671
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,580
You should prepare a response.

672
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,180
And they'd all prepared like the usual sort of,

673
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,620
you know,

674
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,040
fairly bland celebrity response.

675
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,100
And then he was like,

676
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,320
nope,

677
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm fully going for it.

678
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,300
So that was good.

679
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,180
And I hope he,

680
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,120
I hope he enjoyed presenting the award.

681
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,060
I mean,

682
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,440
online,

683
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,900
but yeah.

684
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,560
And so we'll put that in the show notes.

685
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,700
And you can also watch the acceptance speech for X4 as well.

686
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,160
Cool,

687
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,440
cool.

688
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,920
No,

689
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,200
it's,

690
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,400
I liked the Saint of Bright Doors a lot.

691
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,440
I gave it a four out of five on Goodreads listeners.

692
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,420
And so,

693
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,520
and so I am looking forward to Rakes Fall.

694
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,140
So yeah,

695
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
I will read it.

696
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,440
I keep waiting for it to turn up in any of my libraries,

697
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,500
which it has not done.

698
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,360
But I mean,

699
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,620
it's,

700
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,880
it's on Kindle.

701
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,280
I definitely posted in places where you're aware of when it was like Solaris,

702
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,940
in the Solaris ebook sale.

703
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,800
Yeah.

704
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,160
Skill issue.

705
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,460
So I think I own it.

706
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,940
Yes,

707
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,940
I do own it because I bought it cheap when Liz was posting about it in the,

708
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,820
in the appropriate Discord thread.

709
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,840
Don't worry.

710
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,600
We'll come around again.

711
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,660
I don't have notifications turned on for Anonymous Claire,

712
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,360
except for that one thread,

713
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,560
the discount books thread,

714
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,480
which does ping my phone when people post it.

715
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,240
That's a really good idea.

716
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,800
Let me just set that up.

717
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,700
Highly recommend.

718
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,500
All right.

719
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,460
We've distracted Alison.

720
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,220
So quick,

721
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,100
let's talk about things while Alison's distracted.

722
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,980
There has also been,

723
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,960
uh,

724
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,600
other award news.

725
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,780
So Los Angeles has opened their Hugo award base competition.

726
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,840
Listeners,

727
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,560
if you are thinking that you might want to submit a base to the Hugo base design contest,

728
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,300
LA con five.

729
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,260
If you think you might want to do this,

730
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,920
uh,

731
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,560
you can submit,

732
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,220
uh,

733
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,500
there are some restrictions.

734
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,420
You need to be able to,

735
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,680
you need to be able to deliver 40 completed bases.

736
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,780
You've got a,

737
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,360
the base must stand on their own.

738
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,020
You can't,

739
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,080
you can't require a person to be there holding it up.

740
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,060
That would be hugely inconvenient for everyone.

741
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,520
And et cetera.

742
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Um,

743
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,100
so there's like a big old,

744
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,420
there's a big old list of things.

745
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,060
LA con five will pay a maximum of $300 per base to cover materials,

746
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,280
labor,

747
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,580
packing,

748
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,820
shipping and shipping insurance.

749
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,400
So timelines,

750
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,040
the submissions close on the 31st of December,

751
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,620
2025.

752
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,500
And then the convention might get back to you to request followup information.

753
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,020
And the deadline for that will be the end of January and they will make,

754
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,600
a decision on the 15th of February,

755
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,020
2026.

756
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,780
And then the,

757
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,340
you have to get the basis to LA con before LA con,

758
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,400
which seems reasonable.

759
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,320
It would be a giant pain in the butt.

760
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,980
If the base has arrived after LA con,

761
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,440
uh,

762
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,640
we will put a link in the show notes.

763
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,860
It won't be as pretty as my Hugo award base.

764
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,380
Cause it was done by the very lovely Ian Clark and,

765
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,020
you know,

766
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,800
tight and where Hugo represent unless Ian does it,

767
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,120
in which case it might be as lovely.

768
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,680
Yeah.

769
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,120
No,

770
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,240
Hugo basis ever as lovely as the one you actually won.

771
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,000
This is,

772
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,360
this is true,

773
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,740
especially when it's your first,

774
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,320
I imagine also true,

775
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,920
but yes,

776
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,180
however,

777
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,320
it is a great opportunity.

778
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,380
If anyone has a great idea for something kind of LA related,

779
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,140
I think that's probably also part of the,

780
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,520
you know,

781
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,740
criteria in which they will judge should be vaguely LA related.

782
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:31,640
And then there's also other awards news this time from China.

783
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,660
So the 36th galaxy awards were presented.

784
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,020
This is not,

785
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,500
I mean,

786
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,120
you know,

787
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,840
congratulations,

788
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,180
to all the winners,

789
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,540
most of whom I have not heard of.

790
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,900
And the ones I have heard of,

791
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,680
I have not read the,

792
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,660
or I will say that best translation was run by.

793
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,840
I'm so sorry.

794
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,700
I'm going to do,

795
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,700
this is not going to be correctly pronounced listeners,

796
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,280
but Lee key kin,

797
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,580
who is the Chinese translator of the city of last chances by one Adrian Tchaikovsky.

798
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,380
So well done,

799
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,680
Adrian.

800
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,640
And well done to Lee key chin.

801
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,960
But the reason this is notable is that there is a addendum,

802
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:17,840
to the bottom of the far seven 70 article reporting on it about galaxy cons ambitions to become world con.

803
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,420
This is interesting because basically during the panel,

804
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,740
there was a panel themed.

805
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,700
There's a panel called,

806
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,200
how can we turn galaxy con into world con,

807
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:35,360
but it's the person who won the galaxy award in Chinese translation for their novel star body,

808
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,000
whose name is Roderick Levenhart.

809
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm sorry if I've pronounced that wrong.

810
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:39,940
But it's the person who won the galaxy award in Chinese translation for their novel star body,

811
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:45,060
they basically reported on a panel and file seven 70 reports.

812
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,320
Leevenhart reports.

813
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,260
There is interest in returning world con to the country,

814
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:54,880
but the thing that Leevenhart is actually written seems to be about galaxy con becoming the size of world con.

815
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,800
It doesn't seem to be about galaxy con bidding for world con.

816
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,420
And there is a comment in the below the article by Nicholas white,

817
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:09,920
basically saying that his conversations with galaxy con organizers that didn't indicate to him that they were thinking about bidding for world con.

818
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,880
So yeah,

819
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,240
I think this is probably based on a misreading of the con report,

820
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,080
but I don't know.

821
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,540
We will link to the original con report as well in the show notes listeners.

822
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,260
But yeah.

823
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,560
So what do you guys reckon?

824
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,240
Do you think this is indication that China is going for another world con?

825
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,480
Or do you think this is a wrong end of the stick?

826
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,700
Do we think China should go for another world con?

827
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,320
What's the,

828
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,700
what's the feeling here?

829
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,280
I mean,

830
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,120
it sounds like there's one,

831
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,960
one panel that may have been miss quoted in translation.

832
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,120
Um,

833
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,400
I don't really,

834
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,300
I don't really mind.

835
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,080
I mean,

836
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,060
I don't think,

837
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,700
I think it's interesting in that.

838
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,420
I don't think there's much perception from people.

839
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,040
I know that Chengdu is a success,

840
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,020
but again,

841
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:59,160
we've talked about how it's hard to know what the perception is like within Chengdu fandom and even within Chinese fandom about whether it's a success or not.

842
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,660
But it is interesting that they're still talking about things like,

843
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:01,840
you know,

844
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,240
if they're saying,

845
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,620
how can we make it world con scale?

846
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,380
They're obviously still kind of thinking about comparisons to world con in some way.

847
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,640
Um,

848
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,260
yeah,

849
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:09,400
I think,

850
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:09,520
I think,

851
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,260
I wouldn't be,

852
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,960
I'm not automatically against another world con bid in China at some point,

853
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,520
but we probably have quite a few questions along the lines of how do we know that we won't have the same problems as Chengdu,

854
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,180
which is fair,

855
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,880
which is what any bid is going to have,

856
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,080
right?

857
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,220
Like whenever there is a Japanese world con bid,

858
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,900
one of the questions is how will you make enough money for it to be sustainable this time?

859
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,420
You know,

860
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,980
people are always going to question that.

861
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,340
So it's going to be those kinds of questions as well as all the questions China had last time.

862
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,840
And if they've decided,

863
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,160
actually,

864
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,480
we'd rather just have our own large,

865
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,860
scale cons that aren't world con,

866
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,580
then I say they go for it.

867
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,120
Yeah.

868
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,300
I mean,

869
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,500
there are plenty of conventions in the United States that are as big as world con.

870
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,020
Hmm.

871
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,260
It's not that big.

872
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,800
No,

873
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,400
I think the,

874
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,120
the,

875
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,700
the,

876
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,000
the unwritten part,

877
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,120
or maybe not the unwritten part is the,

878
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,360
the reach of world con as well,

879
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:56,600
right?

880
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:56,900
The,

881
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,260
the,

882
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,120
if you want to make galaxy con into world con,

883
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,620
I don't think you're just talking about attendees.

884
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,600
You're talking about like,

885
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,280
how do we make the galaxy award into the Chinese Hugo award in terms of not in terms of reach,

886
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,360
uh,

887
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,880
as well.

888
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,620
Yes.

889
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,080
And I'm sure that's a big part of what they're trying to do,

890
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,620
isn't it?

891
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,240
I mean,

892
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,060
I assume like,

893
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,760
I think if you're starting a new award,

894
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,320
the Hugo award is one of the more prestigious awards you could benchmark yourself against,

895
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,920
especially given all the discussion there always is about kind of like,

896
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,420
um,

897
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,100
you know,

898
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,640
there's a lot of people who are sort of invested and like get the prestige of the Hugos without

899
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,220
necessarily feeling particularly linked into world con.

900
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,320
And I think that's a weird situation for us to have ended up in.

901
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,240
It's essentially like,

902
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,420
our own little convention awards,

903
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:49,940
which have become a much bigger deal than most convention awards are just due to kind of history and time and so on.

904
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,280
And I don't know if you can recapture that without it being,

905
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,700
well,

906
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,380
the reason that people are kind of interested in the Hugos is they've been around for 70 years.

907
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,160
I don't know.

908
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,460
That's fair.

909
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,120
I think I would,

910
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,360
I would agree with that take.

911
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,000
How are we going to do a podcast if you just keep agreeing with my takes,

912
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,160
John?

913
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,880
Well,

914
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,660
uh,

915
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,800
hang on.

916
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,980
Be less sensible,

917
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,300
Liz.

918
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,840
I'm sorry.

919
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,920
Screw you,

920
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,500
Liz Bauer.

921
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:16,000
The reason that the Hugos are popular is because of other factors.

922
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,680
And it has nothing to do with the time length and constituency.

923
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,980
Longevity isn't everything you need.

924
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,140
There has to be something about a sense that in the past,

925
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,120
it has been awarded to some good things.

926
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,720
They don't all have to be good.

927
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,660
I mean,

928
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,020
the Hugo has been awarded to some terrible things.

929
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,080
But I think one of the things,

930
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,260
that makes awards prestigious over time is people going back and going,

931
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,620
oh,

932
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,780
actually that,

933
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,720
that is a fair reflection of the best of the body of work at the time.

934
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,760
Also,

935
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,460
but that thing about you having to keep doing it.

936
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,760
it can,

937
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,680
it's quite hard to sustain awards.

938
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,120
You know,

939
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,400
we,

940
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,180
we have a bunch of awards that have run their time and run out.

941
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,900
You know,

942
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,980
awards don't necessarily carry on forever.

943
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,560
Yeah.

944
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,280
I think that's interesting because I would say certainly,

945
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,420
uh,

946
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,080
for novel,

947
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,840
I think,

948
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:08,960
you know,

949
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,020
I think the guys have probably managed pretty well to,

950
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,960
yeah,

951
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,920
keep up with what historically 50 years hence we think,

952
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,180
okay,

953
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,380
yeah,

954
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,340
that was a pretty good novel.

955
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,880
If they consistently pick stuff that no one has ever read for 50 years,

956
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,360
and I don't think they would have quite the,

957
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,380
the reach and the cachet they do now.

958
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,460
And that's why there are,

959
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,740
you know,

960
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,700
obviously our podcast jumps going through and reading them all.

961
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,380
An award where someone's like,

962
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:30,620
okay,

963
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,560
we're going to actually go and read everything that this award has picked

964
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,680
for the past 60,

965
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,320
70 years.

966
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Um,

967
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,840
it's only sustainable if there are some interesting,

968
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,660
things on there.

969
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,420
It's also interesting that it's a popular award.

970
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:48,420
If you look at most of the other longstanding awards that people know about

971
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,280
and talk about,

972
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,660
they're often industry awards that are either juried or voted on by,

973
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,740
um,

974
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,460
a group of people in an industry.

975
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,640
The,

976
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,260
you know,

977
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,380
the,

978
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,600
the Hugo's are quite a populist,

979
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,040
quite unusually populist and,

980
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,540
and come out quite well considering that.

981
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:08,720
Um,

982
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,320
a lot of the stuff is good and popular.

983
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,160
And then finally the Tianwen awards were awarded in Chengdu.

984
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,840
And one of the people awarding one of those awards was,

985
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,060
um,

986
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,840
Ben Yalow as reported by,

987
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,060
uh,

988
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,540
Sats Culture.

989
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,300
Um,

990
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,100
so yes,

991
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,360
that was interesting.

992
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:24,820
I thought,

993
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,600
um,

994
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,420
what did Ben get his award for?

995
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,200
I think he presented an award.

996
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,840
I'm not sure he received an award.

997
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,080
I might be wrong.

998
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,280
I failed to listen to the exact previous sentence properly.

999
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,280
File 770 just says,

1000
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,600
but Ben was present and participated.

1001
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,480
So I assume he was presenting.

1002
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,440
Although I am basically assuming that on the fact he didn't win,

1003
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,760
I guess he could have just been doing like an interstitial bit.

1004
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,580
Um,

1005
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,000
but yes.

1006
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,640
So I hope,

1007
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,180
I hope Ben enjoyed the awards.

1008
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,360
There is a photo of him on stage,

1009
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,060
um,

1010
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,680
under a banner labeled top 10 Chinese sci-fi literature translations of the

1011
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,580
decade that went global.

1012
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,720
So maybe it was a feature about kind of,

1013
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:04,940
you know,

1014
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,620
stuff that has become popular overseas due to translations.

1015
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,580
A lot of which are,

1016
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,840
who six ends novels,

1017
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,420
but also,

1018
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:10,860
um,

1019
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,180
a few others that might be recognizable to people from being on,

1020
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,260
I think on the Hugo list or certainly on award lists.

1021
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,100
All right.

1022
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,840
Most influential sci-fi IP adaptation case.

1023
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,560
All right.

1024
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,640
I'm going to have to look into these,

1025
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:23,940
um,

1026
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,900
categories in more detail.

1027
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,000
Before someone starts,

1028
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,400
uh,

1029
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,040
adding them to the proposing them as additions to the Hugo's.

1030
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,980
Oh yeah.

1031
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,040
That's because that's what we need.

1032
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,160
We need more Hugo's.

1033
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,460
I definitely think we need a Hugo for most influential sci-fi IP

1034
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,200
adaptation case.

1035
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,360
Maybe we do.

1036
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,720
So I'm going to give the listeners a little spoiler for a future bonus

1037
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,160
episode.

1038
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,180
I am a fan of a podcast listeners called the incomparable and sometimes

1039
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,720
they draft things.

1040
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,260
And I thought it could be fun for us all to draft our own Hugo award

1041
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,940
ceremony from a list of all of the categories that have existed or have

1042
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,920
been proposed for the Hugo awards.

1043
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,020
I have a collection.

1044
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,340
I haven't put all of them,

1045
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,660
all of them in because there are some weird ones from the fifties,

1046
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,340
but I've left,

1047
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,700
left out.

1048
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,620
Um,

1049
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,200
but at some point in the future,

1050
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,920
you know,

1051
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,780
I was going to pick number one fan face,

1052
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,120
John.

1053
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,960
All right.

1054
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,700
It's going in there.

1055
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,000
Liz is going in,

1056
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,040
but yes.

1057
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,420
So if you have any ideas for categories,

1058
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,340
you think should be in the Hugo awards,

1059
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,200
please write in so that we can include them in our big list.

1060
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,580
And I won't read them out as locks in an episode before we get there,

1061
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,840
but I will credit the ones that listeners,

1062
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,620
uh,

1063
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,760
suggested in that episode.

1064
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,720
So yes,

1065
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,040
write in with your writing,

1066
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,600
write in with your Hugo categories that no one has ever suggested,

1067
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,060
but you think would be great.

1068
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,700
And,

1069
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,080
uh,

1070
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,840
and I will add,

1071
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,620
I will add most influential sci-fi IP adaptation to the list.

1072
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,760
I think that's enough on awards.

1073
00:34:52,760 --> 00:35:00,360
Should we talk about comics?

1074
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,320
Comics?

1075
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,080
Comics.

1076
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,340
Okay.

1077
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,560
They're sort of books with pictures.

1078
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,460
All right.

1079
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,680
So I,

1080
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,320
I've been to a convention or rather I've been to a festival.

1081
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,420
Um,

1082
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,380
I went to the Bangkok comics art festival,

1083
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,200
uh,

1084
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,580
yesterday,

1085
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,400
which is held in,

1086
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,640
uh,

1087
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,720
the Bangkok art and culture center,

1088
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
which is a big city center,

1089
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,460
sort of art gallery with revolving,

1090
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,000
revolving exhibits.

1091
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,620
Uh,

1092
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,820
I think it's also sort of a cultural hub a bit as well.

1093
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,500
There's coffee shops,

1094
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,180
there's places you can buy art supplies,

1095
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,800
uh,

1096
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,100
et cetera,

1097
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,460
et cetera.

1098
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,520
There's bookstalls in there.

1099
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,000
Um,

1100
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,880
so it's quite an interesting place.

1101
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,900
And I popped in because they have,

1102
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,020
they have this comic art fest.

1103
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,540
Essentially,

1104
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,020
it's a display of art on the fifth floor.

1105
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,480
the Bangkok art and cultural center is basically a big sort of circular

1106
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,920
building.

1107
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,760
And there's kind of exhibits around the curved walls of each floor.

1108
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,480
So on the fifth floor,

1109
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,020
they had an exhibit of comics art,

1110
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,040
which I went to look at.

1111
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,700
Um,

1112
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,960
so which was from their special guests.

1113
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,100
They had a couple of special guests.

1114
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,960
Some of it was from like local artists.

1115
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,160
Some of it was from,

1116
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,680
um,

1117
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,840
there's lots of these projects,

1118
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,860
which are like jointly with different embassies and things like that.

1119
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,640
That happen occasionally,

1120
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,240
where they will kind of like fund a comic art project.

1121
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,460
So some of that,

1122
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,140
and there's also,

1123
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,680
they have a partner called children of the forest foundation,

1124
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:20,460
where they go to a children's home and school on the border to work with like

1125
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,740
migrant children and their families.

1126
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,740
And they showed some of the comic arts,

1127
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,200
uh,

1128
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,060
created by those children,

1129
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,080
which was pretty great.

1130
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,960
And there were also stalls where you could buy things.

1131
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
You could buy art and stickers by comic creators.

1132
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,320
You can also buy books by,

1133
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,560
uh,

1134
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,180
there's probably a house called bluff publishing that I've heard of who are

1135
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,760
based out of India.

1136
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Who are there with a table.

1137
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,420
There were signings and things.

1138
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,320
There were some panels and workshops,

1139
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,540
but I timed my visit to Pauly and did not go to any of the panels and

1140
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,060
workshops,

1141
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,940
but yeah,

1142
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,000
it looked pretty neat.

1143
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,120
And when I was there,

1144
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,920
it had a lot,

1145
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,840
there were lots of people wandering around looking at the art,

1146
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,440
uh,

1147
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,280
chatting to people.

1148
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,320
There was some kind of,

1149
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,640
uh,

1150
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,140
art interactive art thing you could do where you were drawing with wood.

1151
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,360
I think it was pretty cool.

1152
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,260
And it's all free.

1153
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,880
Uh,

1154
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,740
the art is up for two weeks and then there's like a two day,

1155
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,520
you know,

1156
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,320
this two day thing where they have the panels and workshops and it was just a

1157
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,900
cute little event.

1158
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,340
And I think it happens annually.

1159
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,720
So I'll go back next year and maybe time my visit slightly better and

1160
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,060
actually make it to some of the panels.

1161
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,160
That seems fair.

1162
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,700
Two days of panels,

1163
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,520
but then two weeks that the arts up.

1164
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,320
So I guess it's like a kind of,

1165
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,240
is the convention in the middle of those?

1166
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,880
No,

1167
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,300
it's on the,

1168
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,340
it's a two week thing and it's on the convention on the last two days.

1169
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:36,920
Oh,

1170
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,500
interesting.

1171
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,700
I,

1172
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,240
I would have done it.

1173
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,140
I would have done it.

1174
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,520
I mean,

1175
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,400
I think I would have done it the other way around,

1176
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,420
but fair enough.

1177
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,620
So you can look at the arts and then you can have the discussions.

1178
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,520
I guess that makes sense.

1179
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,180
How long has it been running for?

1180
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,200
Is that the first iteration or is it?

1181
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,680
No,

1182
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,700
it's the fourth one.

1183
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,740
Fourth one.

1184
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,380
Oh yeah.

1185
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:53,680
I see.

1186
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,400
BKK,

1187
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,200
BKK comics art festival.

1188
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,780
Number four.

1189
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,000
That was a clue.

1190
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,260
Liz,

1191
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,860
the number four.

1192
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,400
And I think I've,

1193
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,260
I can't remember.

1194
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,020
I've popped in before.

1195
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,240
No,

1196
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,820
I think what I've been to before was like,

1197
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,500
they have a lot of like student art shows in there as well from like

1198
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
graduating students.

1199
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,800
And I'm sure I went to one where they'd all made comics.

1200
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,000
And so it was a sort of very similar thing.

1201
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,680
Nice.

1202
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,800
So did you,

1203
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,360
did you,

1204
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,680
did you buy any comics?

1205
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,320
Did you learn about comics?

1206
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,940
I did not end up buying any comics.

1207
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,960
I was looking to buy something from blast,

1208
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,560
but I think their table person was having lunch.

1209
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,580
So I did not because I have a big book called the book of the blast book of

1210
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,420
anti-cast SF,

1211
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,600
which got picked in some kind of year roundup of the year's best SF last year.

1212
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,480
I look very good.

1213
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,280
There were quite a few comics.

1214
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,140
There was some like,

1215
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,220
there was a table full of,

1216
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,420
I think Marvel and DC stuff that was being sold.

1217
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,660
And then there was some artists selling like little stickers and things.

1218
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,900
And there were some people selling zines,

1219
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,760
but most of the zines were in Thai and my ties,

1220
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,060
no one a good enough to read a zine.

1221
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,740
So I did not purchase them.

1222
00:38:53,740 --> 00:39:00,080
I was buying a game from a Spanish publisher about the Spanish resistance to

1223
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,400
Franco.

1224
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,060
And I was like,

1225
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,520
do I buy this game in Spanish or do I buy it in English?

1226
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,260
I mean,

1227
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,440
for me,

1228
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,280
it's also the fonts.

1229
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,060
Like I have a very hard time buying the fonts.

1230
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,100
Hard time with stylized fonts.

1231
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,780
Oh,

1232
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,880
in Thai because of the different alphabet.

1233
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,220
That makes a lot of sense.

1234
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,200
It's really hard for me to read anything other than a fairly standard alphabet.

1235
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,080
And even then I'm not very good at reading standard alphabet.

1236
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,340
So yeah,

1237
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,100
that is one,

1238
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,340
one issue,

1239
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,060
but it's cute.

1240
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,660
They all exist.

1241
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:31,260
I find that with Japanese and then also for Japanese for puzzles and German for

1242
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,920
board games.

1243
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,180
I find that my,

1244
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,980
like my German's good enough for most of the bits of board game rules,

1245
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,360
except for fiddly,

1246
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,220
fiddly little details,

1247
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,940
which are the essence of board game rules.

1248
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,260
And that,

1249
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,860
and that's also what I found in Japanese with puzzles that,

1250
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,480
that I'd,

1251
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,100
I'd be going along quite well until,

1252
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,680
until it got to the real detail of,

1253
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,740
of how turns worked or whatever.

1254
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,120
I had the same thing with,

1255
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,280
my friend has the German version of,

1256
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,780
of Hanabi.

1257
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,040
We got the gist of the rules,

1258
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,680
but then when I bought it in English,

1259
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,040
I was like,

1260
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,160
oh,

1261
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,520
there were,

1262
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,780
there was one key rule,

1263
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:11,600
which we were playing completely wrong because we had slightly mistranslated the

1264
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
German and that.

1265
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,480
Yeah,

1266
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,400
exactly that.

1267
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,360
The Blast Book of Anticast SF does look fascinating.

1268
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,880
I can get it shipped from India,

1269
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,480
but it would cost me 25 pounds,

1270
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,700
but it is kind of tempting.

1271
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,260
I mean,

1272
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,680
I think you can also buy an ebook off their website.

1273
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,440
So I think I'll probably end up doing that instead.

1274
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,580
It's a chunky book.

1275
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,140
So yeah.

1276
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,960
Uh,

1277
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,240
okay.

1278
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,080
But that looks good.

1279
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,580
That looks like a really good thing.

1280
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:30,880
I,

1281
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,260
I,

1282
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,880
I wish I lived in Bangkok.

1283
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,020
It's a cute little thing.

1284
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,700
And yeah,

1285
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,180
it's all free.

1286
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,100
Apart from,

1287
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,260
sorry,

1288
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,760
apart from the work,

1289
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:36,960
the jobs,

1290
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,260
I guess.

1291
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,500
How do they,

1292
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,300
I guess,

1293
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,000
is it then,

1294
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,340
is it sponsored then?

1295
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,940
Uh,

1296
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,840
I do not know exactly what funding they get.

1297
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,580
Oh,

1298
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,240
the BKK Comics Art Festival is brought to you by Children of the Forest Foundation,

1299
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,200
Clip Studio Paint,

1300
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,500
the Japan Foundation,

1301
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,120
Taika,

1302
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,020
the Embassy of Belgium,

1303
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,960
Nicholas,

1304
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,200
and BKK Unzine.

1305
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
So I,

1306
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,680
I think it's funded by Nicholas White.

1307
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,480
I'm pretty sure.

1308
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,800
I think that's what I've just learned.

1309
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,500
Uh,

1310
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,780
Nicholas,

1311
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,500
do write in,

1312
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,780
do you fund

1313
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,020
a Bangkok comic art festival?

1314
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,780
Really?

1315
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,220
Alison,

1316
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,860
did you zone out at a key point that means that that makes no sense at all?

1317
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,780
I'm,

1318
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,820
I'm just permanently zoned this week.

1319
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,100
Sorry,

1320
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,600
guys.

1321
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,420
That's all right.

1322
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,160
I know that Nicholas does not work for the,

1323
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,540
uh,

1324
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,240
Thai Belgian Embassy,

1325
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,800
but Nicholas is an,

1326
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,160
a diplomat who lives in Belgium.

1327
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,900
So,

1328
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,360
uh,

1329
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,060
I've arbitrarily decided that he represents all Belgian diplomatic missions.

1330
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,760
That seems perfectly reasonable.

1331
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,060
Let me,

1332
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,640
it makes total sense though,

1333
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:39,880
right?

1334
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,780
Because of the,

1335
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,120
you know,

1336
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,880
strong comics history of Belgium.

1337
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,980
And so I think there was some art from a Belgian artist in the displays.

1338
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,800
And for listeners who thought we were being facetious about Belgian comics,

1339
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,520
um,

1340
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,760
Belgium is one of the preeminent countries for comics in the world.

1341
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,360
Uh,

1342
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,980
and the two you've probably heard of our Tintin and the Smurfs,

1343
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,080
uh,

1344
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,540
which is,

1345
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:03,940
you know,

1346
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,120
those are the two big Belgian exports,

1347
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,740
but the,

1348
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,680
there is a whole Wikipedia page on Belgian comics.

1349
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,660
And if you're not familiar,

1350
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,160
go look it up in the show notes,

1351
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,780
but I'm a big Tintin fan.

1352
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,480
Not,

1353
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:13,900
I mean,

1354
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,440
obviously there are problematic aspects to Tintin,

1355
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:16,780
but,

1356
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,140
um,

1357
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,780
but I grew up with Tintin.

1358
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,240
I love him.

1359
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:19,620
I've got,

1360
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:19,960
I got,

1361
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,980
I got two of the comic,

1362
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,500
uh,

1363
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:22,900
covers,

1364
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,280
uh,

1365
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,440
as prints in my,

1366
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:24,760
uh,

1367
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,360
dining room.

1368
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:25,700
Hmm.

1369
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,640
Um,

1370
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,840
so,

1371
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,020
and in fact,

1372
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,520
Hergé is one of the seven famous Belgians.

1373
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,240
Yes.

1374
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,700
Along with Poirot.

1375
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,440
Yeah.

1376
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,140
He's fictional.

1377
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,560
And Papa Smurf.

1378
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,760
Also fictional.

1379
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,460
And Tintin.

1380
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,700
Also fictional.

1381
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,560
All of the best famous people from any country are fictional.

1382
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,320
The best,

1383
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,900
the best English person is Sherlock Holmes.

1384
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,540
Oh,

1385
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,280
grief,

1386
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,640
no.

1387
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,880
Unless it's Doctor Who.

1388
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,060
No disputing matters of taste.

1389
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,700
Doctor Who,

1390
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,100
yeah,

1391
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:57,960
much better choice.

1392
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,580
Look,

1393
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,660
there's lots of famous Belgians.

1394
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,320
It's just,

1395
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,280
they're all cyclists and you've never heard of them.

1396
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,080
Then there,

1397
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,700
I,

1398
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,480
and I did,

1399
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:07,700
I,

1400
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,620
do not write in with famous Belgians,

1401
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:09,960
please.

1402
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,700
I'm sorry for my co-hosts.

1403
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,180
Listeners,

1404
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,040
please write in with famous Belgians.

1405
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,200
Oh,

1406
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,360
no,

1407
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,660
no,

1408
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,160
please don't.

1409
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
Um,

1410
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,080
then I was going to talk about only a little bit because I don't have first hand,

1411
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,820
um,

1412
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,480
experience,

1413
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,980
but there is a,

1414
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,940
a convention that I read about in Rascal called the Asian Board Games Festival,

1415
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,680
which sounded absolutely fascinating and sounded like a very kind of,

1416
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
um,

1417
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:37,720
very,

1418
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:37,780
very,

1419
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:37,820
very,

1420
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:37,880
very,

1421
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:37,900
very,

1422
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:37,920
very,

1423
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:37,940
very,

1424
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:37,980
very,

1425
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,000
very,

1426
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,020
very,

1427
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:38,040
very,

1428
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,060
very,

1429
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,080
very,

1430
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,140
very,

1431
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,240
very,

1432
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,340
very,

1433
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:38,380
very,

1434
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:38,440
very,

1435
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:38,480
very,

1436
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:38,540
very,

1437
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,620
very,

1438
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,000
pictures on Rascal and it seems really cozy and little,

1439
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,800
but I'd love to have gone and some of the zine pictures of like stalls and the zines on offer look amazing.

1440
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,500
Um,

1441
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,820
so this was held in,

1442
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,440
uh,

1443
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,200
Georgetown on Penang Island,

1444
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,040
which is part of Malaysia.

1445
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,640
Um,

1446
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:59,160
but it's also held in Singapore and they're about to hold one in the Philippines.

1447
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,780
So if we have any,

1448
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,440
um,

1449
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,220
Singaporean,

1450
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,960
Filipino or,

1451
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,280
uh,

1452
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,300
Malaysian listeners do write in and let us know if you've ever been to the Asian board game festival,

1453
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
but it looks pretty great.

1454
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,420
And I'm trying to persuade,

1455
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:10,760
um,

1456
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:18,160
basically my mission listeners is to get Liz to go and report back because Malaysia is not that far from Thailand compared with,

1457
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:18,600
you know,

1458
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,080
Birmingham.

1459
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:24,160
I feel like the Tokyo game market is also very good in that space.

1460
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:24,980
I mean,

1461
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:25,460
famously,

1462
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,220
maybe we need to have a patron just so we can send Liz to Asian conventions and report back.

1463
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,280
Come on.

1464
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,500
Why,

1465
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,620
why limit our sites?

1466
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:33,980
Why not?

1467
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,140
So,

1468
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,260
um,

1469
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,640
I can go to Asian game conventions and I can report back.

1470
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,020
This is closer.

1471
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,380
Cause I can get the train to Georgetown.

1472
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,740
It'll cost me about 30 quid is why.

1473
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,880
Wow.

1474
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,100
Trains are great.

1475
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,700
Uh,

1476
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:45,960
yes.

1477
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,400
Sadly,

1478
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:46,820
John,

1479
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,240
uh,

1480
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,140
did not alert me to this convention until six months after it took place,

1481
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,660
but maybe next year.

1482
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,660
In my defense,

1483
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,520
I only found out about it when Rascal wrote the retrospective.

1484
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,960
So I did.

1485
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,540
I also did not know about it in advance.

1486
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,480
Awesome.

1487
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:01,880
Well,

1488
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,380
thank you very much,

1489
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:02,520
Liz.

1490
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,380
That sounds very interesting.

1491
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,280
And,

1492
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:04,540
um,

1493
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,560
I hope you go to the next one.

1494
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:13,060
Shall we do picks?

1495
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:13,840
Yes.

1496
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:21,320
And let's continue the Le Guin theme of the episode with Alison's pick.

1497
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,480
Oh yeah.

1498
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:22,800
No.

1499
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,940
So my pick is an exhibition and I'm,

1500
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,480
I'm told I have to stop picking things that you can't go to if you're not in London,

1501
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,060
but I think it will be touring after it's only a little exhibition.

1502
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:33,980
So if you are in London,

1503
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,860
over the next month or so,

1504
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,000
um,

1505
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:44,980
the architectural association has an exhibition of Le Guin's maps called the word for world.

1506
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,420
And it is one of,

1507
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,420
it's not a very big exhibition.

1508
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,620
It's just a little gallery room.

1509
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,940
It is one of the most arrestingly lovely exhibitions I think I've ever been to.

1510
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,260
Um,

1511
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,660
they have printed a bunch of Le Guin's maps,

1512
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,760
most of which you will be already familiar with,

1513
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,960
but some of which are new on like cyanotype blue fabric,

1514
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,960
so they're basically blue and white wall hangings.

1515
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,260
Um,

1516
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,960
they have put around the walls,

1517
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,460
some of her original,

1518
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:11,960
um,

1519
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:18,960
sketches for maps and maps and other information about maps and sings from publishers and so on,

1520
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,960
and ways in which maps are different from the way they appeared in the book and so on.

1521
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,460
Um,

1522
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:30,960
and they have laser etched a bunch of talismanic maps onto rocks and they've strewn those around the room,

1523
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,460
um,

1524
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,760
along with a lot of other rocks,

1525
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,700
some of which are rocks,

1526
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,680
which are wrapped and it's all very delightful.

1527
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,540
You probably want to allow half an hour or so.

1528
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,220
It's just a single room,

1529
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:40,820
but it's great.

1530
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,020
So,

1531
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:42,860
and I said,

1532
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,880
I think there's various things have been going on in conjunction with it.

1533
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,880
None of which I have,

1534
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,100
I've seen and will be going on.

1535
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,260
I think it is touring,

1536
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,800
but I don't know the details.

1537
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,480
I will be in London just before that closes.

1538
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,000
I will be going to the,

1539
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,600
um,

1540
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,600
Royal Astronomical Society for a convention.

1541
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,640
And it isn't,

1542
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,740
it isn't that far away.

1543
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,160
So I could just wander over.

1544
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,640
Yeah,

1545
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,120
it can't be very far.

1546
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:08,480
Really.

1547
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,020
All those places are in the same sort of bit posh bit of the West end.

1548
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:12,780
Europe.

1549
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,920
That sounds really good.

1550
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,760
It reminds me.

1551
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,740
Did you go to the exhibition of Tolkien stuff for the Bodleian?

1552
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,440
I can't remember when it was.

1553
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,160
Yes,

1554
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:21,680
I did.

1555
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,640
It was amazing.

1556
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,260
This is,

1557
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,780
this is less grand than that.

1558
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,320
Oh,

1559
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:25,560
I mean,

1560
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,200
that that's fair,

1561
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,220
but I just remember one of the things I remember and the thing I like most,

1562
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,660
a lot of people like Tolkien for his writing,

1563
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,280
but,

1564
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:33,560
um,

1565
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:40,180
I have always preferred Tolkien as an artist to talking as an author and the hand illustrated maps,

1566
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,060
um,

1567
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:45,420
getting to see the original picture of the Aurora from the father Christmas letters,

1568
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,660
and also getting to see his illustrated cryptic crosswords,

1569
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,460
um,

1570
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,520
was the highlight of that exhibition for me.

1571
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,120
So,

1572
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,600
um,

1573
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,820
anything where you're like,

1574
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,660
you know,

1575
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,680
hand drawn maps etched on rocks.

1576
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,160
I'm like,

1577
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:57,580
yes,

1578
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,680
deal.

1579
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,700
I'm excited.

1580
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,480
And,

1581
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,240
uh,

1582
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,760
I think Alison might have already said this,

1583
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:02,980
but,

1584
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,200
no harm in saying it again.

1585
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:04,880
Um,

1586
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,280
that is wrapping up on the 6th of December,

1587
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,480
2025 listeners.

1588
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,240
And,

1589
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:09,580
um,

1590
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,680
it looks like it's easily accessible from a little thing.

1591
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,540
I like to call the underground,

1592
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,480
um,

1593
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,540
Tottenham court road looks like the closest or gooch street,

1594
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,460
which is just a funny word to say.

1595
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,280
Gooch.

1596
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,260
The same day that we saw this,

1597
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,200
we also saw,

1598
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:24,780
um,

1599
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,380
the new exhibition at the British library,

1600
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,860
which is called secret maps.

1601
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,580
No relation.

1602
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,420
Um,

1603
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,320
that's not fictional maps,

1604
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,160
but you know,

1605
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,980
if you like maps,

1606
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,860
that might be a good one to combine with the exhibition.

1607
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,080
I would just say that if you're planning to go to the British library for the,

1608
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,480
um,

1609
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,660
secret maps exhibition that Alison just mentioned,

1610
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,740
the other thing to bear in mind,

1611
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:48,900
the British library often has a large selection of great events that tie in with their exhibitions.

1612
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,700
So I highly recommend looking up to see whether they are doing anything around,

1613
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,340
uh,

1614
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:54,620
that.

1615
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,580
All right,

1616
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,340
Liz,

1617
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,780
do you want to pick next or shall I?

1618
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,620
I can pick next if you want.

1619
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,660
So,

1620
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,040
you know how last time I picked,

1621
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,900
one big fat fantasy book.

1622
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,720
Yeah.

1623
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,580
This time you're picking several big fat fantasy books.

1624
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,620
I'm picking seven big fat books.

1625
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,220
Sorry.

1626
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,580
Whoa.

1627
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,100
I know.

1628
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,540
I'm just making it harder and harder for John to ever,

1629
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,580
ever complete his,

1630
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,000
uh,

1631
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,420
quest to read all my picks.

1632
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:21,700
Okay.

1633
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,580
I'm going to pick a series called dungeon crawler,

1634
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,020
Carl,

1635
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:32,120
which I picked up on a whim because they were down in the kind of long list for best series last year for the Hugos.

1636
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:32,980
And since then,

1637
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,020
since I was determining eligibility,

1638
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,980
I went and looked him up and thought,

1639
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,160
Oh,

1640
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,040
that sounds interesting in a kind of like,

1641
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,480
it's a big self published series.

1642
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:48,500
And I don't think that many self published series get enough nominations to get even into the kind of the bottom realms of the long list,

1643
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,340
which was kind of an indication of kind of quality.

1644
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,940
And then I realized they're on Kindle.

1645
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,340
So I thought,

1646
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,400
I'll pick one up and read it.

1647
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,520
And dungeon crawler,

1648
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:56,840
Carl.

1649
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:02,900
So it's basically what if aliens came to earth and turned up,

1650
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:07,300
turned earth into like a giant kind of MMORPG,

1651
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,180
um,

1652
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,200
which is a reality TV show,

1653
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,040
um,

1654
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,960
broadcast across the galaxy and everyone on earth who,

1655
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,420
uh,

1656
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,080
hasn't been,

1657
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:16,460
uh,

1658
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,380
killed in the collapse,

1659
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,540
which is when all buildings clap.

1660
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,160
So anyone who's outside gets kind of,

1661
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,660
you know,

1662
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:26,160
they can choose to come into the dungeon and play the crawl for the chance at basically winning,

1663
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,460
winning their lives back.

1664
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,520
Interesting.

1665
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,220
So it's like a fan.

1666
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,680
It's almost like a fantasy chain.

1667
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:32,880
Gang.

1668
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,560
All stars.

1669
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:33,980
Yeah.

1670
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,240
It's not,

1671
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:34,400
I mean,

1672
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,520
it's not really fantasy.

1673
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,260
It's science fiction,

1674
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,200
but because the kind of the crawl is often very fantasy themed,

1675
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,240
there's lots of orcs and goblins and things.

1676
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,100
Oh,

1677
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,580
okay.

1678
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,400
That's interesting.

1679
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,240
But it's also very like self-referential.

1680
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,040
Well,

1681
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,820
yeah,

1682
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,860
I don't mean self-referential.

1683
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,260
I bought it.

1684
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,020
It's kind of meta.

1685
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:56,320
So we follow Carl who was outside trying to rescue his ex-girlfriend's cat,

1686
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,920
princess donut.

1687
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,080
And so he was barefoot and in boxes.

1688
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,300
And so he has to enter the dungeon barefoot and in boxes with princess donut.

1689
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,400
Who becomes sentient very quickly.

1690
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,680
And it's seven books,

1691
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,240
basically of their adventures in which they realize that they are part of

1692
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,440
galactic geopolitics in a way that no one had foreseen at the start.

1693
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,720
There is an AI,

1694
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,280
which is getting gradually more and more and hinged.

1695
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,440
The game is not fair in that because Carl comes in,

1696
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,800
in his boxes and in bare feet,

1697
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,440
he keeps getting upgrades that mean he has to keep his boxes on and not ever

1698
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,000
get any trousers.

1699
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,160
Brilliant.

1700
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,980
And the AI is pushing this.

1701
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,240
The,

1702
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:32,400
the,

1703
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:32,780
the,

1704
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,100
civilizations run the crawl in

1705
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,100
different years, every time they find a new

1706
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,060
planet they do this again basically

1707
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,600
and so there's a long long history of this

1708
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,300
and it just builds and builds and builds all this world building

1709
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,500
and backstory into it

1710
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,220
and of course kind of Carl and Princess

1711
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,140
Donut get allies and become

1712
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,580
more and more powerful until

1713
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,220
by the last book I read, which is the seventh one, they're basically

1714
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,040
just sort of fighting a

1715
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,160
big fantasy war

1716
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,160
against different factions from

1717
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,060
the galaxy which is having repercussions

1718
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,420
outside the dungeon

1719
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,160
Okay, this sounds

1720
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,360
fascinating

1721
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,900
Yeah, so the first one is just sort of like, I was like

1722
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,060
okay, well that was a bit fun, they you know

1723
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,180
crawl through the dungeon, it was fun

1724
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,140
Carl's quite fun, he's got a sentient cat

1725
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,200
who now only talks in capitals in the in-game

1726
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,040
chat because he won't ever like

1727
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,740
not have the caps lock on, that kind of thing

1728
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,900
When I was midway through book three or four I was like

1729
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,220
okay, these are dragging a little bit, this crawl

1730
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,700
is going on a little bit long

1731
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,800
every book is basically like a floor

1732
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,340
of the dungeon and they're getting deeper and deeper into the dungeon

1733
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,480
you know, this is going on a bit and then

1734
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,460
sometime about book five or six I was like, oh

1735
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,260
I see what this is kind of building to now

1736
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,480
I can see where this is going and they're just very enjoyable

1737
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,180
they are very long

1738
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,680
probably a little bit too long

1739
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,660
they're very heavily

1740
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,640
serialised, so if you forget who

1741
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,580
a character is from a previous

1742
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,600
book, they might come back again

1743
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,660
and then you're looking through the wiki to try and find

1744
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,960
out who they are without getting any spoilers

1745
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,680
So their books, it sounds to me like

1746
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,720
they're books to buy an e-book because I find

1747
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,140
that being able to search e-books

1748
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,500
for the names

1749
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,600
of characters is the single

1750
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,520
most useful thing to have

1751
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,360
an e-book for. So the thing is

1752
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,040
they might be books to buy an e-book but

1753
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,600
I believe that the author

1754
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,720
Matt Dinaman still self-publishes

1755
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,200
the e-books himself

1756
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,160
and the audiobooks, which apparently are great

1757
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,420
but they've been picked up by

1758
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,480
Ace as actual physical novels

1759
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,480
but I think they don't have the e-book

1760
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,480
rights and I don't know how heavily edited

1761
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,440
they have edited

1762
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,940
them in the time of transition. I suspect not

1763
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,100
that heavily. I suspect they're maybe

1764
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,020
not that much changed but it is

1765
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,100
possible that the paperbacks are different

1766
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,620
than the e-books. I haven't dug into that.

1767
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,200
So this could actually be one to read in paperback

1768
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,020
if they've kind of cleared up a few

1769
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,040
bits where it's just like, you know, there's one where

1770
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,460
they're all on trains

1771
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,640
the floor is train themed

1772
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,760
and there's a little author's note at the beginning saying

1773
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,960
don't worry about how confusing this is, it's supposed to be

1774
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,840
confusing for the crawlers and I'm like yeah but

1775
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,000
if it's confusing for me then that's not

1776
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,080
great. But yeah, I thought

1777
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,740
I would read one and see how they go and

1778
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,860
then like I'd read all

1779
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,860
seven? I just read the

1780
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,940
Wikipedia page so to try and find out

1781
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,360
the answer about the editing

1782
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,280
so

1783
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,860
in response to

1784
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,680
questions about whether the publisher would make changes

1785
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,720
Dinaman responded that the story would remain the same

1786
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,580
but the series had undergone rigorous edits

1787
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,080
which sounds like yes. But also

1788
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,920
the Wikipedia page notes that

1789
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,840
he had a spreadsheet with

1790
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,860
198 pages to keep

1791
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,720
track of the characters and storylines, eventually

1792
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,540
had to create a second spreadsheet to

1793
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,560
track content on the first spreadsheet

1794
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,800
and then the spreadsheet got big enough that it

1795
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,560
didn't work on his computer anymore

1796
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,040
so he had to hire someone to make him a Notion database

1797
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,840
Yeah, I'd be

1798
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,660
interested to, I would be interested to

1799
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,640
see the difference between them

1800
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,680
because there are a few bits where I'm like oh you could maybe

1801
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,720
have like trimmed this down a bit. I can't tell in

1802
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,840
page count but some of the books are like over 800 pages

1803
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,800
they are long books. These did not

1804
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,800
sound like for me. Oh they're probably not

1805
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,580
for you but like honestly

1806
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,600
I picked up the first one and thought oh well

1807
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,340
some people nominate for this you go oh there's a

1808
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,520
seven books I may as well give the first one a go and by the end

1809
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,460
of it I was like yeah I'm getting into this and

1810
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,960
then by like book four or five you're like

1811
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,520
oh this is what's happening now and

1812
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,600
yeah. They've stopped becoming just kind

1813
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,400
of straightforward Carl and Donut

1814
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,480
get a quest and find out the floor's overarching

1815
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,480
theme and into like yeah this is

1816
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,540
what's going on in the world

1817
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,520
and like not really a spoiler but like

1818
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,480
the possibility is these are such a big

1819
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,380
thing in the universe that there's a possibility

1820
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,360
you know when there's a possibility that they could

1821
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,280
change this and basically improve

1822
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,780
society for everyone

1823
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,540
then they're taking it yeah.

1824
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,120
That sounds fascinating. I could buy the hardback

1825
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,860
from Waterstones for £26.

1826
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,100
I'd read an e-book first and if

1827
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,100
you really like their first e-book then maybe consider

1828
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,080
getting some of the later ones in Harbour. No Liz

1829
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm going to buy the first hardback

1830
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,740
I'm doing it. Oh no no

1831
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,760
now I feel like what if John doesn't like it?

1832
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,000
It'll be alright. I

1833
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,880
am going to

1834
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,280
pick The Lord of the Rings

1835
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,400
Fate of the Fellowship

1836
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,920
This is

1837
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,120
a board game listeners.

1838
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,140
Pause for ooze.

1839
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,160
Ooh that's not

1840
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,140
like you to pick a board game. Is it

1841
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,340
Octothorpe Gaming Corner?

1842
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,340
Octothorpe Gaming Corner. Yay!

1843
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,460
So this

1844
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,200
is the latest

1845
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,100
pandemic game by

1846
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,560
Matt Leacock. It is

1847
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,080
it doesn't even have

1848
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,840
the word pandemic in the title

1849
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,960
and BGG confidently says it

1850
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,020
re-implements pandemic and I think the word re-implements

1851
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,080
is doing a hell of a lot of work there. So

1852
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,920
this is a game where you

1853
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,160
control two characters from

1854
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,340
the books

1855
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,880
so there's like suggested

1856
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,440
characters for your first play

1857
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,820
and I don't know all of the characters but like

1858
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,000
you've got everyone from the fellowships in there obviously

1859
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,360
you've also got Eomer, Eowyn

1860
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,840
Galadriel, Gollum

1861
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,940
other various

1862
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,160
people. The aim of the game

1863
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,180
is to complete

1864
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,040
four objectives one of which is

1865
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,080
always to

1866
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,040
unforge the one ring by casting

1867
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,720
it into Mount Doom

1868
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,800
and you have to move

1869
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,920
around the map and instead of having

1870
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,780
little cubes to know in

1871
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,780
pandemics you have tiny little meeples

1872
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,920
with little swords and they're red

1873
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,480
and they're orcs and

1874
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,920
you add orcs to the board

1875
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,960
in a similar way to the way you would add

1876
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,820
cubes to the board in pandemic. So

1877
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,880
basically you have a deck of cards that tells

1878
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,460
you sometimes orcs

1879
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,720
arrive on the board and you put them on the board or

1880
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,800
sometimes they're moving from place to place along

1881
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,900
arrows that are drawn on the board and you move

1882
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,520
them. But in true pandemic style

1883
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,740
the cards you've just had every so often

1884
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,320
will shuffle and go back on top of the deck

1885
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,680
so places that have orcs will keep getting orcs

1886
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,600
and orcs moving will keep moving.

1887
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,580
You lose by running out of hope

1888
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,620
various things influence hope

1889
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,560
but the one that kind of is the most relevant

1890
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,660
is if an orc gets into one of the

1891
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,600
havens on the board and you

1892
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,640
can't defend it then you will lose three hope and given

1893
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,620
that the hope track maxes at eight

1894
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,760
if that happens three or four times in a game

1895
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,080
you will almost certainly lose.

1896
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,420
And so it's recognisably pandemic

1897
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,320
like you can see the bits in it which are

1898
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,460
pandemic but also you have things like

1899
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,200
you can muster troops

1900
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,360
it also comes with a cardboard

1901
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,520
Eye of Sauron dice tower which is

1902
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,520
the single best thing I've ever seen come in a board

1903
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,360
game. It is absolutely great

1904
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,740
it is really good

1905
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,360
so I think the

1906
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,660
truest indication of how good it was

1907
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,220
was we played it at

1908
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,140
Cottaging and we lost

1909
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,640
and then we just

1910
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,320
started again straight away

1911
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,460
we were like now we are going to play this again

1912
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,120
immediately and then we

1913
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,160
were all sitting down like at one

1914
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,240
point and like it was quite late and everyone

1915
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,620
was like I don't really want to play anything

1916
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,220
and Rob was like I mean I'm always tempted to suggest

1917
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,360
Fate of the Fellowship but I don't think people would go for it

1918
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,320
and then four people went yes I'll

1919
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,360
play that and we immediately just played

1920
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,260
like this game like

1921
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,940
I don't know what time of day it was

1922
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,060
but like every time someone suggested playing it

1923
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,200
there was immediately four people being like yes I will

1924
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,000
play that game and I think it was probably

1925
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,300
one of my two favourite

1926
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,720
games of this Cottaging.

1927
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,920
I can't say much that hasn't

1928
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,120
been said better by Shut Up and Sit Down

1929
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,740
so I will link to their

1930
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,940
review video in

1931
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,160
the show notes but this is just

1932
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,000
it really shows off

1933
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,780
how good

1934
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,820
Leacock is as a

1935
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,820
designer that he's made something based

1936
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,880
on the pandemic underlying mechanics

1937
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,060
that feels so different to

1938
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,380
pandemic itself

1939
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,900
and there are multiple people in our group who really don't like

1940
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,780
OG pandemic who liked

1941
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,760
this quite a lot so yeah

1942
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,720
I highly recommend. I've just looked up

1943
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,720
the Eye of Sauron

1944
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,240
Dice Tower and it does look cool.

1945
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,340
Well it's also it's not plastic it's

1946
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,580
made of cardboard and you assemble it at the start

1947
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,740
so like because they could have made

1948
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,680
it like a stupid like really

1949
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,800
expensive loads of plastic

1950
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,700
components game but it's

1951
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,900
all wooden meeples and cardboard components

1952
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,400
and I really like that

1953
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,600
because I don't really like plastic in my

1954
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,660
board games. So I have a

1955
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,600
slight dissenting opinion

1956
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,860
here which is that it was on Board Game

1957
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,240
Arena

1958
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,520
and

1959
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,400
we had a go at it and bounced

1960
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,480
off it pretty hard. We kind of

1961
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,400
were like well this is like pandemic

1962
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,620
but with a load of fairly random

1963
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,280
extra stuff and

1964
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,520
then we so we kind of played it until we were

1965
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,500
fed up and then stopped so that was probably an hour and a half

1966
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,580
or two hours and then later

1967
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,480
Jonathan played some solo

1968
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,300
and came back and said

1969
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,460
ooh but there's quite a lot more

1970
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,660
to this so maybe we have not given it a fair shout.

1971
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,580
I would say I don't think there's

1972
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,260
much. It has

1973
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,100
dice but

1974
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,620
you... No not random

1975
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,340
in that way. Random in a kind of

1976
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,380
oh complexity. So we have

1977
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,360
at least one person in our gaming group that

1978
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,140
is very anti

1979
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,420
complexity in board games.

1980
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,240
Really would prefer games where you

1981
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,500
just sit and think at each other for four hours.

1982
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,880
It is not that.

1983
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,060
And it is also a game where

1984
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,120
it is a game I think

1985
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,000
in the best cooperative mould

1986
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,240
where the parameter

1987
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,760
space for the options

1988
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,040
for each character is large

1989
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,940
enough that it is very difficult for one

1990
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,740
player to play the whole game on

1991
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,020
their own so you can't

1992
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,840
really quarterback which is a marked

1993
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,380
departure from base pandemic

1994
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,940
and I think I very much like

1995
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,840
games like Spirit Island has the same

1996
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,860
thing and so does Arkham Horror the card game

1997
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,720
where you don't have enough

1998
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,040
information about the game state

1999
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,720
and the game state is sufficiently

2000
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,980
complicated that you can't hold it in one person's head.

2001
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,860
That. That's the problem.

2002
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,300
That's not the problem.

2003
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,680
No I know.

2004
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,260
Because the worst cooperative games

2005
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,280
are the ones where one person can play and three people

2006
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,240
watch. Oh no but we like

2007
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,820
to chat right?

2008
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,340
So we did get bogged

2009
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,300
down in this one. But I mean I'm not

2010
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,320
saying we would necessarily get bogged down in it again.

2011
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,580
We might have another go at this.

2012
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,420
Because as I said it is on Board Game Arena.

2013
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,160
So if you fancy a go at this you don't have to pay money

2014
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,880
for it. You can just go and play it on Board Game Arena

2015
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,940
and see if you like it.

2016
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:54,180
And then you can buy it later.

2017
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,900
I think it is also on

2018
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,540
Tabletop Simulator but I don't know how

2019
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,720
I don't know how official that implementation is.

2020
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,460
It's worth noting if you

2021
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,960
look it up on Board Game Arena

2022
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,440
if you type Lord of the Rings it will tell you

2023
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,760
that there are no results. You have to type Fate of the Fellowship

2024
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,500
which I think is

2025
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,460
a search bug in

2026
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,640
Board Game Arena perhaps.

2027
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,660
Of which there are many.

2028
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,600
On that bombshell that was the Octothorpe Podcast

2029
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,620
and it's goodbye from me.

2030
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,720
It's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me.

2031
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:52,700
Bye for now.

2032
01:02:52,700 --> 01:03:22,680
Bye for now.

2033
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:52,660
Bye for now.

2034
01:03:52,660 --> 01:04:22,640
Bye for now.

2035
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:52,620
Bye for now.

2036
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,900
The theme music for this episode

2037
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,560
was Fanfare for Space

This podcast will end at the beep.

2042
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,300
Beep.

2043
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:06,340
Thank you.

2044
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:06,380
Thank you.

2045
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:36,360
Thank you.
