1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,160
I know I've got the right.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,160
So the question is, do you want flow first or do you want women first?

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,220
Oh, I have opinions on women.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,320
So let's do women first.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,320
OK, should I do women first?

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,980
So when John said I have opinions on women is title of the episode.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,980
That means I've got to put that in.

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,600
That's got to go in now, Liz.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,600
So.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:46,420
Hello, everyone, and welcome to a very special episode of the Octothorpe podcast, which we're recording out of time in which we will be discussing the movie Dredd.

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,900
I am John Coxon.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,280
I'm Alison Scott.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,420
And I'm Liz Batty.

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,580
We will today be discussing.

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,540
Dredd.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,660
So Dredd is a movie from 2012.

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:10,440
It was directed by Pete Travis and it was written by Alex Garland and it stars Carl Urban, Lydia Thelby, Lena Headey and a variety of other people.

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,100
I watched this, I believe, when it was in cinemas.

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,360
I might be wrong about that.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,660
And I've always thought it was good for two kind of key reasons.

21
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,420
Firstly, it's an incredibly tight film.

22
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,640
Which does not overstay its welcome and tells a simple story with great skill.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,720
And secondly, it is Dredd is one of the great British science fiction institutions.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:42,380
And it is nice to see one of the great British science fiction institutions get its turn on the big screen, especially after the previous one was somewhat less well received.

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,680
And also, I've always been a massive fan of Alex Garland's work.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,680
So that kind of gives you some idea as to why I might have quite liked this as well.

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,400
And then I made Alison and Liz watch it.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,520
I should say this is the first of a new series.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,040
We made each other read books and now we're going to make each other watch some movies.

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
And this is the first of those movies.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
I thought from reading the Internet that Pete Travis started directing it.

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,340
But Alex Garland more or less took over before the end of the movie.

33
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,280
I don't know where I have that in my head.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,300
I was very much just doing the credits as they are reported at the end of the film.

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,280
But there is there is quite a lot of online discussion.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,020
There is a lot of online discourse about how much Alex Garland ended up doing.

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,740
And I think it is it is greater than zero.

38
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,500
You are true.

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,360
You are correct.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,120
Yes.

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,680
Yes.

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,260
I mean, this is posts like, quote, Alex Garland actually directed Dredd, says Carl Urban.

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,880
Yeah.

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,380
And I think that is relevant because while Pete Travis has gone on to have, you know, he's got quite a long and illustrious career.

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,320
It's not really been in movies like this one.

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,260
Not that there are, I think, very many movies.

47
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,560
Like this one that I can't claim to have done a full study.

48
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,960
So let me do let me do the patented Cox and Vibes recap and then I'll actually talk about the plot.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:09,240
So Dredd is a story about a woman who is doing rather badly on her test scores.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:16,660
But presumably we find reacts better to coursework and ongoing assessment than exams.

51
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,240
And she is paired with a kindly mentor who brings out the best in her.

52
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,480
So Dredd is a movie.

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:32,220
So we open with Judge Dredd pursuing three criminals through the streets who are driving dangerously while under the influence of narcotics.

54
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:42,320
And as the sort of scene goes on, that escalates and he eventually decides that they need to be dealt with more harshly.

55
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,360
And they kill a civilian and things go kind of up from there.

56
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,220
And that really sets the scene for Dredd's color.

57
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:59,620
And the level of hyper realized violence we're going to see in the movie, which is very much drawing from 300 and Sin City.

58
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,880
I think those are clear influences on the film.

59
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,880
And then brought into the Hall of Justice.

60
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:12,500
And he's presented with a new recruit, Judge Anderson, who has scored sort of slightly under the passing grade for a judge.

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,440
But it's a powerful psychic.

62
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,460
So they want to put her in the field and see whether she can cut it.

63
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,200
And so he takes her and does.

64
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,240
And she decides they're going to go and visit a triple homicide in peach trees.

65
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,300
And they do that.

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:33,920
And through the course of the movie, it turns out that the homicide was perpetrated by a man who they sort of catch quite early on.

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:44,060
But then it becomes clear that actually the narcotics that the three people at the beginning of the movie were using are being manufactured and distributed from peach trees.

68
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,180
And the gang boss who is in charge of the manufacturing shuts the entire block down and motivates the three people.

69
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,720
And so we have this thing where the judges are trapped in this block and everyone in the block wants to kill them.

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,780
And they are also keen to go up and deal with the gang boss because because, yeah, there's this big distribution network in the block.

71
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,760
And then, you know, it all ends happily ever after, sort of.

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,380
So that's kind of the basic plot synopsis.

73
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm doing it a drastic disservice because the film loops back like everything that comes up comes up again later.

74
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,160
And I have not really done a good job of encapsulating how any of that sort of thing works.

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,940
But but that's the kind of basic plot.

76
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,100
Did I miss anything?

77
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,540
Do you think Alison and Liz?

78
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:39,320
I don't know if you explain the peach trees is a giant apartment block tower, like almost small society of its own within this giant city, Mega City One, which is where Judge Dredd is set.

79
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,460
And so that's how it can be locked down.

80
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,580
Essentially can go into a war mode.

81
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,100
Peach trees is an arcology to use the sci fi.

82
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,620
Term of art and and is one of many.

83
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,920
You see that in the establishing shots of the city, you see that there are many towers like this.

84
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,440
Yeah.

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,240
So so I have some backstory.

86
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,140
I've been obviously very familiar with the idea of Judge Dredd since being quite a small child because I don't know when.

87
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,300
When was the first appearance of Judge Dredd in comics, John?

88
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,520
Two thousand a day.

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,760
Eighty one, I guess.

90
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,440
No, it's Prague, too.

91
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,940
He was in issue two.

92
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
So, yeah.

93
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,980
So 1977.

94
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,120
But I've never really read the comics.

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,840
I never followed 2000.

96
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:31,900
And just all my knowledge of Judge Dredd has kind of soaked in through the skin of being a British teenager and having a lot of friends who read Judge Dredd and 2000.

97
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,560
Yeah.

98
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,520
But nevertheless, quite a lot had soaked in.

99
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,500
It turns out there have been 2400 issues of 2000 AD approximately at the time of recording.

100
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,880
And yeah, Judge Dredd has been in the majority of them.

101
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:59,280
But like so 2008, he's been written by writers like I mean, it's been written by Alan Moore and a variety of other writers that ended up going and being much more well known for working in American comics.

102
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,600
So like Grant Morrison, Garth Ennis, people like that.

103
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,860
I was gonna say, I think I have probably the least exposure to actual Judge Dredd than you do.

104
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,620
Obviously, I've picked up a lot by osmosis.

105
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,920
But all I really know is Judge Dredd is a chin that dispenses justice in a dystopian future.

106
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,700
And has a motorbike.

107
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,900
And that is it, basically.

108
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:25,680
One of the things I love about this movie is the range of emotion Carl Urban can convey with just his downturned mouth and chin.

109
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,480
Yeah, so I think he does a good job of that.

110
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,580
But he is by necessity incredibly limited in what he can do and kind of makes the most of that.

111
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:45,920
And it is an interesting problem to give your film when you have a main character who is basically unable to emote apart from with like the bottom.

112
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,260
20% of his face.

113
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:56,120
And I presume this is why Judge Anderson has this basically contrived thing where she leaves a helmet behind because her psychic powers won't work as well as she's wearing a helmet.

114
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,400
But that is also because if you had your two lead roles both wearing helmets, then I think that would be too much for the film.

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,080
So I can go behind that.

116
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:10,320
I think Judge Anderson doesn't wear a helmet in the comics either because it was the 70s and she was a girly.

117
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,720
So I mean, it's complicated, right?

118
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
But it's the same thing.

119
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,620
It's the same issue.

120
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,940
You know, you've got this issue.

121
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,420
If you're going to say Judge Dredd never ever takes his helmet off, then it makes it hard for both comics and movies.

122
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,140
Yeah.

123
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,840
But it's probably easier in the comics because you can have him think things.

124
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:35,080
You can have him, you can have like little comic doohickeys where they say, where they refer back to things.

125
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,260
No, that is fair.

126
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,980
So I guess the next question is, what did you two think about the movie?

127
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,880
Shall I say, well, thank you for suggesting I watch this because it is.

128
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,600
Absolutely not a film I would ever have watched without the prompt.

129
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,640
Wasn't keen on the subject matter.

130
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Wasn't keen on the ultraviolence.

131
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,080
I did.

132
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:05,860
I was realized I was aware of it when it came into the cinemas because this was designed to be the first kind of 3D ultraviolence film.

133
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,000
I wonder whether you saw it in 3D when you saw it in the cinema, John.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,440
Oh, I mean, it was it was it was 13 years ago, Alison.

135
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,300
Maybe.

136
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,100
I don't know.

137
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,640
Who knows?

138
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,040
But there are a lot of shots that are designed, especially with a connection with the slow-mo drug.

139
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,040
They have been designed to kind of look exciting in 3D.

140
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,240
And so not just watching it on a flat screen, I kind of went, oh, well, that's interesting.

141
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:45,240
So maybe I will at one point put my helmet on in the form of a of a meta quest and watch it again in 3D, because I think that would be quite interesting.

142
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,260
And and resonant.

143
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,860
And I would have to make my reactions to the film solely with my chin at that point.

144
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,760
Yes.

145
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,560
Instead of my reaction to the film.

146
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,340
And I apologize to listeners because this is a visual joke, which was.

147
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:08,460
So it was not bad.

148
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,240
Stephen started and said, oh, it's it's only 95 minutes long and about two minutes into the movie.

149
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,080
I was like, yeah, but it may.

150
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,020
I feel a lot longer.

151
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,060
So I don't I think it drags a little bit in the middle.

152
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,540
It's not very draggy.

153
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,280
And the second act could could be tightened up.

154
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:31,140
But I think in general, yeah, there's not a lot of not a lot of fat.

155
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:37,860
So I do not like ultraviolence and I did not like the violent bits of this and the bloody bits of this.

156
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,260
But apart from that, I think it's not a bad film.

157
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,560
Liz, what did you think?

158
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,940
I thought it was pretty good.

159
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,260
Way.

160
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,340
Yeah.

161
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,180
I mean, I think if I was star rating it, I'd give it like a solid three and a half.

162
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,100
Yeah, that's fair.

163
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,240
Or two.

164
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,180
I don't give star ratings, but two.

165
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,540
So we're definitely on a gradient where John likes it most, Alison likes it least.

166
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,000
And I am somewhere in the middle, as is with like nearly everything.

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,400
Right.

168
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,060
There's always a great.

169
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,780
And for some reason, I'm always in the middle.

170
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,220
That's not true.

171
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,220
You like there's at least there's been a couple of episodes where you've liked something.

172
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,820
Me and Alison have been like, nah.

173
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,020
So, like, it's not always the case that you're in the middle.

174
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,040
But on my.

175
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,940
My private scale, I use the board game geek rankings, board game geek like rankings in my head.

176
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,120
And for me, a three out of five is like the lowest ranking at which I would watch a film again.

177
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,400
Is that true for you?

178
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,540
Would you watch this again?

179
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,400
I would watch it again, but not for a while.

180
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,140
That's fair.

181
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,460
In 3D on goggles for the bit.

182
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,180
If I was around at someone's house and they were like, let's watch Dredd, I'd be like, yeah, fine.

183
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,180
I will watch Dredd again.

184
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,960
It's 90 minutes.

185
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,620
It's quite fun.

186
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,340
Oh, no.

187
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,620
If I was around at someone's house.

188
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,220
They said, let's watch Dredd.

189
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,600
I'd be like, oh, that's good because I've got some little solo games I need to be playing.

190
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,280
You know, I'll go off and do that.

191
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,720
I was going to ask Alison.

192
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,660
So you've you gave it two out of five.

193
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,780
So for me, that would be two out of four, two and a half out of five, two and a half out of five.

194
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:07,280
OK, so that for me is the lowest rank at which I concede that something is good, but just not my cup of tea.

195
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,080
Whereas one half star below that, I'd be like, I don't think this is good.

196
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,740
So what's going on here is that this is a this is a movie that is.

197
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,480
It's absolutely not made for me.

198
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,600
Yeah, I am not the target audience for this film.

199
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:28,680
Nobody is making films like that thinking, oh, gosh, we're going to get the seniors going to a movie on a Tuesday afternoon crowd in to see this one.

200
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,340
Yeah, no fair.

201
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:39,280
Yeah, but they probably were hoping for the people who have been fans of 2008 for a long time crowd.

202
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,880
But I haven't been a fan of 2008 for a long.

203
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,320
So.

204
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,540
So one of the things about Judge.

205
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:54,340
Dredd the comic strip that I'm not sure comes out sufficiently in the movie is the is the satire in the sense of how awful this society that is being depicted is.

206
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,800
I mean, obviously you get that, but it's kind of pushed backwards in the movie.

207
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,560
The reason that the people at the beginning of the film kill a civilian is not because they want to kill a civilian.

208
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,140
It's because they're being pursued by a judge who is going to hand down very long sentences.

209
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,060
Oh, yeah.

210
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,420
So I think that's that is.

211
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,200
In the movie.

212
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
But they kind of they kind of get away with it.

213
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,100
They kind of get away from that as a concept.

214
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:28,700
When when the building gets locked down, it allows them to just say, oh, at this point, the Dredded Anderson are fighting for their lives.

215
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,140
So anything they do is OK.

216
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,700
And I feel like it doesn't.

217
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,740
It just kind of lets all the actual science fictional content slip away in favor of.

218
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,440
Oh, no, we're going to have a lot of gunfights now.

219
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,260
Liz, do you want to talk about that before I come in?

220
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,780
Like, I don't want to.

221
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,700
Yeah, because I would kind of agree with Alison.

222
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:55,400
I thought it would be a bit more satirical and it ends up playing it a little bit straighter.

223
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,960
Yeah.

224
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,520
Yeah.

225
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,940
So I think this is something.

226
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,000
So I've got two.

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,120
I think I've got two thoughts on this, which is firstly.

228
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,340
Firstly, I think you're right in that.

229
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:12,900
I think the movie doesn't try and grapple with the wider satire very explicitly.

230
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,620
It's absolutely we are not supposed to conclude.

231
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:26,220
I think that first chase we are supposed to notice what Alison noticed, which is that the reason that this has gone wrong is because of the way it is being dealt with by the judge.

232
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,140
And then.

233
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,620
But the movie does also want us to simplify with its main characters.

234
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:37,960
And so the reason it locks the block down is because then it can be like, well, there are problems with Dredd and Anderson and the system they represent.

235
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,220
But we can root for them because the people they are going up against are so much more reprehensible.

236
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,780
I will say.

237
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,620
I think there's a moment.

238
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,200
There's a moment.

239
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,680
I do think the movie tries to hang.

240
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,320
I do think the movie tries to talk about this to an extent.

241
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,620
So one of the things that happens right at the end of the movie.

242
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,340
So there's a good there's like a sequence where Dredd and Anderson is sort of clearing people out in the first act.

243
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,260
And Anderson is very hesitant and they are not working well together as a team.

244
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,820
And then at the end kind of climactic sequences.

245
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,780
There's a scene where they're kind of moving into the gang leaders lair and they're clearing out and they're working.

246
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,180
They're working very, very well together.

247
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,200
And it's a nice kind of shadowing of kind of how that relationship has evolved and a very good show.

248
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,680
Don't tell.

249
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,860
But there's a point at the beginning of the movie where she struggles to kill someone who is severely injured,

250
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,900
but is clearly going to try and kill her if she doesn't kill him.

251
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:34,000
And you can see her struggle and you can see like the kind of the difficulty she's having with that.

252
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,480
And then at the end, she shoots someone in the back on a staircase because they're there and they're still alive.

253
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,620
And I think the movie is being quite clear that she has by becoming.

254
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,060
A good candidate for the judge program.

255
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,000
She has lost something about the humanity she had at the beginning of the movie.

256
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,760
And I don't think the movie makes that incredibly explicit, but I do think the movie is aware of it.

257
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:07,460
And I think a careful reading probably doesn't come out in favor of this system of of of of legal.

258
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,940
What's the word I'm looking for?

259
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,960
Law and justice.

260
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,460
I think it's something where.

261
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,340
If there's a lot of people who would like this to be a sequel to this movie,

262
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,020
but I think if it was an eight part Netflix show,

263
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:24,420
you could really get into like a lot of that in a much more satisfying way than you can in 95 minutes,

264
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:24,840
probably.

265
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:30,700
But I do think it's something worth thinking about because I do think I do think it's less pronounced in the movie than in the comic.

266
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,500
And it is.

267
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,800
And I do.

268
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:41,920
The other thing I wanted to do do that here is I think there is also a parallel between Judge Dredd and Games Workshop and Warhammer 40,000.

269
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,900
And Space Marines.

270
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:53,380
Where the two kind of big, big British grown universes are both incredibly pessimistic, incredibly sarcastic looks at the future.

271
00:16:53,380 --> 00:17:01,020
And also both vehicles which have been taken distressingly seriously by some of the fans.

272
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,860
Because I think there are people who probably like Judge Dredd who are just like Judge Dredd is great and not really thinking about this side of things at all.

273
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,660
And there are definitely those fans in the Warhammer 40,000 fandom as well.

274
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:28,300
Well, both both Judge Dredd, both 2000 AD and Warhammer 40K are trying to catch their fans at an age where they might not think too seriously about what it is they're being served up.

275
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,400
So I think that there is that tension.

276
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:42,780
If you if you catch people at 10 or 12 and they're not thinking very hard and then they could maybe get a more nuanced understanding of the of the whole system.

277
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:50,860
At the point where they're already bought in and buying all your extremely expensive little plastic objects or whatever, then that suits you right?

278
00:17:50,860 --> 00:18:01,200
Or you have people who are 2000 AD readers for life because they absolutely loved it and then realised that there was so much more to it than they had thought to begin with.

279
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,680
Yeah.

280
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,440
Oh, yeah.

281
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:12,820
When I was 11 and getting into 40K, I did not have anywhere near a recognisation of what the franchise was doing compared to my sort of 36 year old.

282
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,960
interpretation of the universe.

283
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:53,140
Yeah.

284
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,020
Also from the comics, but also they did do subtle.

285
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,020
There were subtle, subtle differences in the costumes, which helped a little bit.

286
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,340
But that that that names in big letters on the on the other thing is from the comics.

287
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,080
And you have to do it because otherwise you're going to it's going to be really hard.

288
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,660
Yeah.

289
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,500
I think Liz is right.

290
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:12,880
Liz is right.

291
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,580
Obviously, that part works really well.

292
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:23,780
I also want to say they make a couple of other good decisions here, which is firstly the judges they get in the four actors.

293
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,000
Two of them are notably bigger than Carl Urban, and one of them is a relatively petite woman.

294
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,460
So it is quite easy at a glance to tell the silhouettes are very different.

295
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,760
But the other thing is the colouring of the uniform.

296
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,360
So the movie repeatedly uses a kind of primary colour comic book palette.

297
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,340
And one of the things that I think is really important is that the colouring of the uniforms.

298
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,540
the things they use yellow for is very interesting because they use a kind of sickly green yellow

299
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:52,960
for sequences with mama and with gang members and with like the corrupted cd or parts of the block

300
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,960
and they use a kind of like golden angelic yellow to reflect like to reflect the kind of the better

301
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,200
parts of things and that's one of the reason anderson like has blonde hair is because she is

302
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,640
fitting into that color palette but the other thing is if you look at the bad judges uniforms

303
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,740
they have this kind of like sickly yellow tint and judge anderson and Dredd both have a kind of

304
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:22,660
bluish uniform and blue is also used to kind of reflect purity ish in the movie and i think the

305
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,880
movie is very subtle i think the movie is making overt choices but i think it is they have also

306
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,040
thought very carefully about a lot of very detailed things to try and make it obvious to the reader

307
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,800
or the viewer i guess in any given scene like how the colors are fitting in with the story

308
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,560
and i thought that was very effective

309
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:38,620
you

310
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:56,500
I did not spot that at all so thank you john no i mean liz i have seen this movie it wasn't until

311
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,920
like watch seven that i noticed this so i cannot claim too much and the other thing that was

312
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,880
pointed out to me since last time i talked about drag Dredd or podcast is similar which is the

313
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,540
movie does a lot of comic book frames and i think it's a really good movie and i think it's a really

314
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:08,580
good movie and i think it's a really good movie and i think it's a really good movie and i think

315
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:08,600
it's a really good movie and i think it's a really good movie and i think it's a really good movie

316
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,380
and there's a lot of squares and rectangles and every time you look up the block that's kind of

317
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,460
a very classic comic book panel kind of style shot um and and that's very effectively done as well

318
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:27,660
i think those corrupt judges also like i think they did quite good character arcs for anderson

319
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,180
and Dredd and the corrupt judges are part of that because then you see Dredd at the end kind of

320
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:38,420
recognizing that even though anderson has failed by the objective measures he set out at the start

321
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:38,520
and i think that's a really good movie and i think it's a really good movie and i think it's a really good

322
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:38,540
movie and i think it's a really good movie and i think it's a really good movie and i think it's a really good

323
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,500
she would actually be a good thing for justice and so he's prepared to go along with that

324
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,080
yeah and maybe he has unbent a little bit there is a tension in the comic as well where

325
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:58,020
they very much like if you read recent synopses like Dredd resigns in protest about like the way

326
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,340
mutants are treated in the city and there is a plot line where the city is like we will treat

327
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,940
mutants better so Dredd comes back i think the comics do have this tension of well we've got

328
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,500
this character that we've been using for 2400 issues and we've got this character that we've

329
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,020
and so we do have to have him take principal stands and sometimes he has to be right and he

330
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,880
has to be the goody but sometimes he's like they're also the instrument of this incredibly

331
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,760
repressive regime and i don't know how you as a sort of thing it's very difficult to square and i

332
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,980
don't think the movie i think in the comic you probably have a lot more room for that but that

333
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,540
goes back to the movie does want you to sympathize with Dredd even while the movie is not condoning

334
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:38,480
this method of um sorting crime out yeah i feel like they were hoping to start a franchise i think

335
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:46,660
you're probably right um but the movie was just too violent too sad too too much that the franchises

336
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,520
have to have more more light-hearted characterizations and settings i don't want to say

337
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,360
i don't know if i would say you need that for franchise but i would say it feels like yes this

338
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,620
is the first film and i think in some ways simplifies the complexity in order to make

339
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,460
a tight 95 minute film with one pretty linear plot and

340
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,440
where it can deal with introducing the world and introducing Dredd and the judges and also

341
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,720
have all that in there and then you know for the second and future films you'll be able to take a

342
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,600
step back make them wider make them a bit more satirical but they never got to that point well

343
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,340
i think even though i'm not sure what the financial status of the movie is i think carl urban has said

344
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,620
he'd be quite happy to do more but i think the part of the problem is that alex garland did end

345
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,240
up doing a lot of the direction and the production was not a happy one

346
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,080
so i think a lot of the key people from the creative that like um a lot of the key people

347
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,180
on the production side probably wouldn't want to revisit it because they don't have good

348
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,000
memories of it is the impression i get from kind of reading interviews and stuff

349
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,640
it is an amazingly tight film given how unhappy it was in post-production in production and

350
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,940
post-production um i had two i have two big chunky lumps of things to say about this movie

351
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,420
the two reasons that john cited for why this film is good were not because of the

352
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:25,600
Not the reason that I expected him to cite, which is the critical analysis of this film has focused on the fact that it, for a tight 95 minute ultra violent action movie, it has a bunch of well-constructed female parts.

353
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:40,620
This came three years before Mad Max Fury Road, but shares with Mad Max Fury Road the fact that it's named after its male character, but the lead character is a woman and the story is the woman's story, not the man's story.

354
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,740
Judge Dredd doesn't have a lot of character development through this movie.

355
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,160
The primary villain is a woman.

356
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,680
The chief of police, the Lord Chief Justice or whatever she's called, is a woman.

357
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,860
Head judge.

358
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,300
There's a bunch of women in this movie.

359
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,080
The judges are shown as being a mix of men and women with no particular hierarchy there.

360
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,620
That is fantastic for a movie of this kind.

361
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,320
And having said that, it only just passes the Bechdel test.

362
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,340
So despite the fact that it's got a bunch of female characters in, when they talk to each other, they talk about men.

363
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,960
Anderson has a long conversation with Kathy about her, basically about her husband.

364
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,540
Yeah.

365
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,440
People believe that there's a conversation between Anderson and the chief justice at

366
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,220
the beginning of the movie, but there isn't.

367
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,560
It's all conversations with Dredd about Anderson.

368
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,600
There is a little bit right at the end.

369
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,840
So it does pass the Bechdel test, but it's kind of like, well, there are women in this movie,

370
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,900
but they're all kind of put in little boxes where they can't really actually get too uppity, I guess.

371
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,900
I don't know.

372
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,240
I mean, so I think it does great for what it does, but it doesn't really quite do enough there.

373
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,680
That was what I want to say about women.

374
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,260
And John has thoughts about women.

375
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,080
Yeah.

376
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:03,220
I didn't bring this up because I expected it to come up and, you know, I thought I'll let the women on the podcast bring it up.

377
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,720
But no, I think you're right.

378
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,820
I think, I don't think this movie nails the women.

379
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,040
And like, there's a few things I'll come to in a second, but I do think it's notable that this movie has multiple.

380
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:25,280
I would argue the women in this movie have more agency than the men in general, because the person that I think the only man in the movie that I think there were, well, other than,

381
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,680
the corrupt judges who have quite a lot of agency, but are then summarily murdered.

382
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,880
Executed.

383
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,060
Dred is the law.

384
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,780
Yes.

385
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,000
The bit where he says, I am the law.

386
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,960
And he's like, he said the thing.

387
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,640
He said the thing.

388
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,500
Yeah.

389
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,180
It would be great if he'd never said that at any point in the movie.

390
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,960
But no.

391
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,120
So in general, Anderson has quite a lot of agency because she, you know, she's getting to decide her path.

392
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,720
And at the end, she actually rejects it.

393
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,520
The head judge has agency because she is the head judge.

394
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,260
And Mama has quite a lot of agency because she is at the top of her hierarchy and everyone under her.

395
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,100
Is basically entirely at her whim.

396
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,440
And so actually, I think this movie is surprisingly strong for its female characters.

397
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,680
I will say there is a couple of parts where the movie uses sexual violence.

398
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,460
And I'm torn on that because on the one hand, I kind of wish it hadn't.

399
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:19,520
But on the other hand, in both situations, Anderson, who is the kind of intended target, so thoroughly fucks the guy up that it's difficult.

400
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,100
Like the bit at the end where he's trying to shock her and she just stands up and kills him by kicking him in the head.

401
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,240
And.

402
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,000
Breaking his neck.

403
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,860
And you're like, oh, this, this, this, this woman has had enough of the men around her.

404
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,380
And now she is doling out justice.

405
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,580
And so it's tricky because I think there's probably a reading where you didn't need the sexualization of that violence.

406
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:49,120
But I also think the movie is being quite clear that the women in those situations are not going to be actually receiving any and have all the agency in those situations.

407
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,080
Liz, what did you think?

408
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,020
So, I mean, Alison says she thinks like maybe the female characters.

409
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,900
It's kind of a bit put in boxes.

410
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:02,400
But I think kind of all the characters are put in boxes by society, not just the female ones.

411
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,620
And I think I agree with you, which is that I always kind of think, oh, did we actually need the sexualized violence in this bit of the film?

412
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,800
Could you get away without it?

413
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,000
And I think in this case, yes, you could get away without it.

414
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,740
But again, it is in the situation where realistically in this world, it probably would be a part of the backstory of Anderson and Mama.

415
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,500
And yeah, they're both women who one is the main villain.

416
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,200
And is clearly in control of her own destiny until Judge Dredd shows up.

417
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,120
And Anderson gets threatened with it.

418
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,920
But then at the end, she is not super affected by it.

419
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,900
And she gets to kill all the men who have been suggesting it.

420
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,800
So I didn't find it too bad.

421
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,960
I mean, I don't, you know, I'm old.

422
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,480
So I'm used to movies having a lot of sexualized violence in them.

423
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,860
And it didn't seem to be excessive.

424
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,720
It seemed like it was consistent with what's going on in this place.

425
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,360
Yeah.

426
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,480
No, I mean.

427
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:01,900
My reading of it was that what you've just said, which is, you know, it's a present thing.

428
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,820
But I think the movie does a good job of kind of centering and giving the women agency.

429
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:13,180
But I'm just always a little bit worried as a man when I make those decisions in my head.

430
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:19,540
That I might need to chat a little bit around them before I come out strongly with those opinions.

431
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,880
But yes, that basically dovetails with the conclusions I had drawn.

432
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,820
So I am glad I wasn't.

433
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:34,760
The one thing I don't like is I really wish Anderson didn't get shot at the end to give the to make it just Dred and Mama right at the end.

434
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,760
I kind of think Anderson has shown enough competence by that point.

435
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,800
I do think the movie does slightly do her dirty right in that last scene or the penultimate scene, I guess.

436
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,660
But it's a relatively minor, relatively minor quibble, I think.

437
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,700
So I think one of the ways they.

438
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Are stuck by having Dred wear a helmet is it becomes harder to make Dred vulnerable because in a kind of martial arts or action type film, you tend to kind of see the hero deteriorating over time.

439
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,300
You know, they get wounds, they get scratches, they get punches or whatever.

440
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,760
And it feels like you don't really see that with Dred.

441
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:21,720
He kind of despite getting shot and having to do this kind of emergency in the field wound repair, he never feels particularly vulnerable or like he's going to lose a fight.

442
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,480
I think is one thing I felt.

443
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,520
And so again, when.

444
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,640
Like Anderson gets shot, it feels like.

445
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,200
But Dred would be just continuing going on.

446
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,700
It doesn't seem to affect him that he did get shot.

447
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,900
So I think that is one one problem they have with him again wearing the helmet all the time.

448
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,240
He feels a bit too invulnerable.

449
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,420
I know what you mean.

450
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,860
I do think the point where he gets shot and he slowly goes down the thing in the cinema.

451
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,520
I remember thinking, well, how on earth?

452
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,640
Like, how are they going to get out of this?

453
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,900
Because I was like, he does seem like.

454
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,540
And then when he says, wait, and Lex decides to monologue and you're like, and they've.

455
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,740
Lex is such a piece of work and the way he's tearing into Dred.

456
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,920
I'm like, yeah, OK, I would imagine that this guy would do that.

457
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
And he's like, wait for what?

458
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
And then Dred's like, wait for her to shoot you.

459
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,700
And I'm just like, yeah, that's why he's Dred, bitch.

460
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,760
It made me so happy.

461
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:18,780
I think that's why I didn't mind that it's just Dred and Mama at the end because Anderson's had her rescue the hero in a clinch bit there.

462
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,340
Yeah.

463
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,560
This all ties in, though, to my the other major point I want to make, which is why this.

464
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,380
This film is like flow and John's review of flow, which I'm not going to spoil flow too much for you.

465
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,900
I hope.

466
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,860
But John's review of flow was that the BBFC said that this was very mild threat.

467
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,120
And so flow is a U rated film with very mild threat.

468
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:50,240
And I'm going to say that Judge the Dred is an 18 hyper violent movie with very mild threat.

469
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,620
And when my daughter was about, I guess, three, she was just kind of learning.

470
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,660
About narrative and how narrative works.

471
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,000
And she was very scared in movies like flow.

472
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,940
And I said, it's going to be all right.

473
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:13,320
You know, the thing about films, especially films that are made for people like you, is that, yes, the main characters are put into peril, but it is going to be OK for them.

474
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,980
You know, there are there are characters around them like senior mentors who may die off a bit.

475
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,720
But but but, you know, the cat is going to be all right in flow.

476
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,600
And you know that.

477
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,560
If you're above the age of three and you go to see flow, the cat's not going to die.

478
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,880
And the thing about Dredd is Dredd's not going to die.

479
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,380
Anderson's not going to die.

480
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,420
The villain is going to be brought to justice.

481
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,060
And Anderson's going to get a badge.

482
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,660
You know, those things all the way through the movie.

483
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,460
If you're above the age of three, because it's not the sort of movie where those things don't happen.

484
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,440
Anderson could die in previous versions of this.

485
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,520
But but in fact, if you've been reading 2400 issues of 2018.

486
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:00,700
You know that Anderson is a big major character who has a lot of a lot of agency in this world.

487
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,660
And that's the thing.

488
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:08,680
It feels like a very mild threat to me because I didn't think these people were in danger.

489
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,720
And when Dred got shot, as John said, he was thinking, how are we going to get out of that?

490
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,580
He wasn't thinking, oh, no, this is where Judge Dred gets it.

491
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,680
And this is actually a movie about the death of Dred and how the world reacts to that, which an adult movie could be.

492
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,560
You could have a movie like that.

493
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,140
But this was never going to be that movie.

494
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,600
So the BBC, BBFC rates Dred as strong threat.

495
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,380
Yeah, but they just mean they just mean threat with more blood in it, really.

496
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,400
I think the thing with Flo is you repeatedly see the main character nearly drown.

497
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,340
And I would argue that is at least at least moderate threat.

498
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,320
But I think I mean, obviously, the main character in a movie such as this is unlikely to die.

499
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,180
It is.

500
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,940
And it is.

501
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,540
Yeah, there's there's it would have been an interesting choice to have Dred kill him.

502
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,960
And I was not in any kind of point of the movie seriously worried that he would die.

503
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,080
But yeah, no.

504
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,980
So I take the point.

505
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,640
I guess I am more sceptical that that's the definition of threat.

506
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:15,000
But yeah, how you help children cope with narrative is to explain that there'll be a happy ending.

507
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,320
And not all movies have happy endings.

508
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,400
But I'm not really sure that's relevant to Dred unless you were showing your Dred to your three year old.

509
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,520
I mean, I think this is just the narrative conventions of.

510
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,280
Action movies at heart.

511
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,220
It is an ultra violent action film.

512
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:35,620
And, you know, I don't go into like action films expecting the hero to be killed off 20 minutes before the end.

513
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,060
But I do expect to at least give me the illusion that this might happen.

514
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,460
So it is indeed not common in action movies.

515
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,280
And spoiler.

516
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,340
I really like Rogue One.

517
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,320
You know, spoiler for a movie that's a long time ago.

518
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,340
There are movies where where that don't do this, where part of what they do is go.

519
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,960
No, we're going to tell a different story here.

520
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:05,960
You know, if you see a lot of movies that are kind of made for adults, they won't all follow that sort of three act narrative of of of a simple action movie.

521
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,980
They have they do a lot.

522
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,360
Movies can do a lot of different things.

523
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:15,580
I think Rogue One is not the best example here because the reason Rogue One works is we already know the end of their story.

524
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,780
If Rogue One was a standalone film and ends up with them dying and we don't see what happens.

525
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,480
I don't think it works as well as we know this is going to lead into Star Wars and the triumph of the rebellion.

526
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,960
Maybe.

527
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,180
Yes.

528
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,500
I want to bring up something that neither of you have brought up.

529
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,620
Have either of you seen the film The Raid?

530
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,500
Yes, I have, Liz.

531
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,040
Tell me about The Raid.

532
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
So The Raid is an.

533
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,220
I have not seen it.

534
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:54,460
The Raid is an Indonesian martial arts action thriller movie in which a policeman goes into a tower block in search of a drug dealer and is locked down in the tower block and has to fight his way to his home.

535
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,380
He has to go through the top of the tower block to confront the drug dealer.

536
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,460
And it came out in 2011.

537
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,920
So obviously it was in the works at the same time Dredd was in the works, basically.

538
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,280
And they just have coincidentally very similar concepts.

539
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,020
Yeah, it's like it's like is it ants and a bug's life?

540
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:18,720
A similar thing where you end up having you presumably got someone who's been shopping an idea around Hollywood and it causes divergent threads.

541
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,680
I have seen The Raid.

542
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,960
The Raid.

543
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,440
Firstly, I've got two questions.

544
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,180
I've got two comments on The Raid.

545
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,900
Hang on.

546
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:34,820
Maybe I should say that I don't think in that case it was that because The Raid is like a low budget film that was made by a British guard.

547
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:41,440
But in Indonesia, I think I think it's just coincidentally they were making this super tiny film that they never expected to actually go wide.

548
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,160
And then probably Alexander had already written Dredd at the time they were shooting this very small, quickly shot type film.

549
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,720
Yes.

550
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,160
So the poster for The Raid said one ruthless crime lord, 20 elite cops.

551
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,900
30 floors of hell.

552
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,480
And I think that encapsulates my two main criticisms of The Raid.

553
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,180
The fact there are 20 cops makes it a lot harder to grapple with any of them on an emotional level.

554
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,100
I found the movie less.

555
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,640
I found the characters less compelling to me.

556
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,320
But secondly, the poster clearly depicts an apartment building, which is less than 30 stories high.

557
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:24,040
And if you're going to put 30 floors of hell on the poster, pick a 30 floor apartment building for the poster.

558
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,120
Which is not the filmmakers fault, but just absolutely baffling.

559
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,460
Maybe they couldn't get the rights to a 30 story building.

560
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:40,540
I'm always very sympathetic to things that low budget movies have done in order to get made while being very low budget.

561
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,920
And that sounds like one of those.

562
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,260
No, because in the movie, I think it's got it's just the picture they picked for the poster.

563
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,180
It annoyed me.

564
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,860
But yes, I mean, it's a very minor point.

565
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,840
A lot of people very much like The Raid.

566
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,360
I will say that.

567
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,000
So Dredd has a rotten tomatoes.

568
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,780
Dredd's Tomatometer was 80 percent.

569
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:07,120
And the Raid's Tomatometer was 87 percent.

570
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,780
So they are both well received movies in general.

571
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:16,000
I know Tomatometer is not a perfect measure of film quality, but it's not.

572
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,560
It's not.

573
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,020
You know, 80 percent is pretty high.

574
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:23,060
I am now looking at this poster and I believe that what they've done is the.

575
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:28,260
The apartment building is buried eight eight floors into the ground.

576
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,860
So there is a pit around it.

577
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,100
Yeah, there's a lot of headcanoning.

578
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,920
It's really weird because it's obviously a drawing of apartment building.

579
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,680
They could definitely have given it more stories.

580
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,020
I wonder why they didn't.

581
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,880
No one knows.

582
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,560
It's baffling.

583
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,020
But like I say, it's a minor.

584
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,640
But it is.

585
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,080
It is.

586
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,440
It is good to talk about because they are in terms of concept, extremely similar concepts.

587
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,340
I mean, obviously.

588
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,280
The Raid didn't have Judge Dredd in it.

589
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,800
I have one remaining point about this movie, which is a tiny trivial one.

590
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,000
This is Dredd, not the Raid.

591
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,780
Uh huh.

592
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:08,600
Which is that they have a narcotic slow-mo which causes your world to slow down.

593
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,820
So you experience things at a hundredth of their normal speed.

594
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,880
Everything's in slow-mo.

595
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,340
It's a useful narcotic for the plot of the film in a couple of ways, but it doesn't make any

596
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,280
sense as a narcotic.

597
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,880
Why would people do this?

598
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,080
What is the benefit of this particular drug?

599
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,400
I mean, I know I'm probably overthinking this, but I spent the whole movie going, well, why?

600
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,460
Oh, I see.

601
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,760
It's because it suits the movie because they could use it to do things they want to do

602
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,140
in the movie.

603
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:45,280
And otherwise, it was very unconvincing to me.

604
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,240
So that was the only, it seems funny given the context of the movie, but that was the

605
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,220
only time my disbelief suspenders really snapped during.

606
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,240
Yeah.

607
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,320
Yeah.

608
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Yeah.

609
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Yeah.

610
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,180
During this movie.

611
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,280
I went, I don't believe that.

612
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,040
I think.

613
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,340
Okay.

614
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,280
So I'm going to say one thing, I guess, which is I can see, I could see an argument that

615
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,360
it is unrealistic narcotic, but I think for me, the idea that if you're in an unremittingly

616
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:13,040
hellish world, a drug that you took it and it gave you a nice time, but also slowed down

617
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,400
time for the duration of the nice time.

618
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,420
So you spent longer outside of the hell you actually exist in.

619
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,480
I can see that.

620
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,200
I can see that as a kind of.

621
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,300
I can see that as a kind of.

622
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,320
I can see that as a kind of.

623
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,300
Compelling thingy.

624
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,820
Except it doesn't give you a nice time, does it?

625
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,740
Unless you make pretty patterns with the, with the water and stuff.

626
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,680
I mean, if they make you take it and then shove you down a 200 story drop, it gives

627
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,520
you a less nice time.

628
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,440
I will concede that.

629
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,360
Spoiler.

630
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,240
That's not.

631
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Well, that's the first.

632
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,840
That's like very early in the movie.

633
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,180
So, but yeah.

634
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,860
Yeah.

635
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,020
Yeah.

636
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,160
Yeah.

637
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:51,500
So that's the thing is that, that the, um, are they saying that you, you, part of the

638
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,280
experience of taking this drug is like, oh, I'm going to take it.

639
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,680
It's like the bath or whatever.

640
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,000
The, the bit that I went, there was a bit earlier in this movie when I turned to Stephen

641
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,520
and went only the crunchiest, flakiest chocolate.

642
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,340
Liz, what was your view on the narcotics?

643
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,140
They done it because it'll let them do a cool slow-mo fight scene.

644
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,700
Fair.

645
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,820
And I accept this as a narrative convention of action films.

646
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,620
I don't, I don't watch a lot of action movies.

647
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,220
I'm sorry.

648
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,800
It's probably why it's good to give me action films to watch so I could go, oh yeah, no,

649
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,380
that's the thing.

650
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,260
I'm now like, can I?

651
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,520
Can I turn, sell Alison the raid as any kind of science fiction?

652
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,340
The answer is no, but, uh, is it science fiction?

653
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,020
No.

654
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:36,820
So the other thing I will say about slow-mo is I think the things it lets you do is not

655
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,680
just that it fits in with the action movie tropes that Liz highlighted.

656
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:46,040
I think it also lets you do a lot of shots that look like panels from a comic, like the

657
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,360
way that she brings up the water at the beginning that you can imagine being drawn in a comic,

658
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,240
but also the bullets going through and seeing the water.

659
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,280
And I think that's the thing that's so important.

660
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,320
I think that's the thing that's so important.

661
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,380
And I think that's the thing that's so important.

662
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:53,400
I think that's the thing that's so important.

663
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,440
I think that's the thing that's so important.

664
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:53,480
I think that's the thing that's so important.

665
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:53,480
I think that's the thing that's so important.

666
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:53,520
I think that's the thing that's so important.

667
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:53,540
I think that's the thing that's so important.

668
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:53,580
I think that's the thing that's so important.

669
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:53,620
I think that's the thing that's so important.

670
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,120
the blood spatter in slow motion.

671
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,500
That is exactly the way you draw that happening in a comic.

672
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:06,360
And so I think you're right that it is primarily a decision made for visual reasons, but I

673
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,780
think it's specifically some of those visual reasons are to do with the source material

674
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,560
and representing that style in the movie.

675
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,740
And I guess if you're going to make up a drug for your movie, why not make one up that

676
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,220
helps you tell the visual story you want, right?

677
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,040
That was the only thing I had in my note that we haven't covered.

678
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,040
Can I swing back briefly to ultraviolence?

679
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,000
Yes.

680
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,160
Do you think the ultraviolence, do you think loving shots of bullets going through cheeks

681
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,100
or people being skinned and splattered adds a lot to this movie?

682
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,100
Would the movie...

683
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,160
Does it improve the movie?

684
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,400
What is the purpose of doing this?

685
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,860
I think you can't...

686
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,640
The whole thing is a hyper...

687
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,840
Hyper-realistic is the wrong word, but the whole thing is taking what's going on in the

688
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,380
real world and ramping it up to 15, right?

689
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,000
So like, you know, you've got these mega cities which are explicit ghettos and you've got

690
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,700
this justice system which is dispensing justice without proper oversight and you've got a

691
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,080
city in which you can't do anything.

692
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,900
You can't do anything in which people are suffering because there's basically no hope.

693
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,460
And none of that is true.

694
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:24,180
None of that is wholly true in our society or in, you know, 70s Britain from whence this

695
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,540
franchise originated.

696
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,280
But you can see the things that made them want to talk about this.

697
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,780
And so I think that it would be weird to have a realistic level of violence in a movie which

698
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,600
has ramped up all of the social commentary to quite as ridiculous an extent.

699
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
And so I don't think you could make this movie...

700
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:50,500
I don't think you make a 2000 AD based movie if what you're shooting for is a restrained

701
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,960
look on the issue you're tackling.

702
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,600
I think you're going there for the...

703
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,580
With...

704
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:55,680
Yeah.

705
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,200
Unlike in Warhammer 40,000.

706
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,060
Like, again, they're both commentaries on 70s Britain.

707
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:06,560
But like, in 40K, they made Margaret Thatcher into the boss of the Orcs.

708
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,960
And that isn't what she was like in real life.

709
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,880
But you can see how they got there.

710
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,680
But they, like, had to twist a lot of dials very high up to make it work.

711
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,640
See, I don't know.

712
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,600
I think it's a tendency for the source material to go very extreme.

713
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,040
And I think if you don't represent that in adaptations, you sort of think, well, what's

714
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,400
the point?

715
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:35,420
I think I am kind of between you two again, which is I'm not fully convinced by the ultra

716
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:35,900
violence.

717
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,240
But I can see it is part of its stylistic choices to try and be a kind of...

718
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,900
more satirically over the top dystopia.

719
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,360
And also that it does allow them to replicate shots from you would get in the comic books

720
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:55,360
of those very static, violent shots you can get by doing kind of extreme slow-mo ultra

721
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:55,720
violence.

722
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,080
So while I wasn't super keen on it, I am trying to think of the film with that removed.

723
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,160
And I think it would make it just more of a straightforward, like, action-y thriller

724
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,620
type thing.

725
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,960
Although there are action thrillers where they just, they don't even need like a slow-mo

726
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,240
drug.

727
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
They just go for like, okay, this is going to have...

728
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,060
big slow-mo John Woo sections anyway.

729
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:13,720
Hmm.

730
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,480
Oh, yeah.

731
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,180
Like in The Matrix, no one was huffing a narcotic that made bullet time happen.

732
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:18,840
It just happened.

733
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,780
No, but I mean, there's a reason for bullet time in The Matrix, right?

734
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:27,780
You can say it's because they're manipulating the underlying Matrix where...

735
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,540
And I think you're right.

736
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,520
And I think that's why maybe I like the way The Matrix and Dredd do it is that they have

737
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,860
a reason for it to be happening in universe that isn't just, it looks cool.

738
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,220
And like, the reason in universe may end up being because they wanted it.

739
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,640
It's supposed to look cool, but they've actually woven it into the story in a way that I like,

740
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,680
which they didn't.

741
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,160
A lot of action movies do not do.

742
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,680
So that is probably...

743
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,340
I hadn't thought about that.

744
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:49,920
That's interesting.

745
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,640
Do we have anything else to say about Dredd?

746
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,240
Don't think I do.

747
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,760
I will also say I talked about this on a previous podcast, but it wasn't this podcast.

748
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,000
It was Become the Teapot.

749
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,740
And I will put a link in the show notes to anyone who would like to hear me talk even

750
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,620
more about Dredd, which seems unlikely, but is, I guess, theoretically possible.

751
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,100
Yeah.

752
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,280
I think we have more to say about Dredd than I thought we would have to say about Dredd

753
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,000
when I was watching it.

754
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,760
Maybe it's because John has watched it seven times.

755
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,500
I had to prepare for this podcast, guys.

756
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:29,540
I did have to sit down afterwards and go, okay, so what is there to say about this movie?

757
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,960
Oh, no, we made you do some preparation for the podcast, Alison?

758
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,720
Yep.

759
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:33,980
Yep.

760
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,780
I know.

761
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,300
I know.

762
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,640
I know.

763
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,320
It's not like me.

764
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,980
And on that bombshell, that was the

765
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,240
Octothorpe podcast. And it's goodbye from me.

766
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,260
It's goodbye from me.

767
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,880
It's goodbye from me.

768
00:46:46,880 --> 00:47:10,520
How you help?

769
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,460
How you help children cope with narrative

770
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,740
is to explain

771
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,940
that there'll be a happy ending.

772
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,280
And not all movies have happy endings.

773
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,300
But

774
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,620
this sort of movie nearly always does.

775
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,880
But I'm not really sure that's relevant to Dredd.

776
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,740
Unless you were showing your Dredd

777
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,620
to your three-year-old. I mean, I think this is just

778
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,380
the narrative conventions of, like,

779
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,660
Eisen's

780
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,140
coffee spreading.

781
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:38,820
Oh no. Contagion.

782
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,500
The theme music for

783
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
this episode was Fanfare for
