00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,360
Hello everyone, it's John here.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:11,280
Just to let you know, Liz was travelling this episode and she is using a headset mic which has a very attractive low hum during parts of her recording.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,480
This came and went and changed and it made it very difficult to get rid of it.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,880
So there are still some traces on the track and there's not a lot I can do about that, I'm afraid.

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,680
But I hope you enjoy the episode anyway.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,120
On with the show.

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,380
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 151st episode of Octothorpe

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:55,280
Which is lying in front of the bulldozer and wondering why its house is about to be knocked down on the 15th of January 2026.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,559
Happy New Year.

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm John Coxon.

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,680
Happy New Year, I'm Alison Scott.

12
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:00,879
And I'm Liz Batty.

13
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,239
We're a bit rusty, aren't we?

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,479
Look, right, all of the pauses will come seamlessly out in the edit, Liz.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,880
Has it been a while, guys?

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,680
No, I think we should leave them in.

17
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,840
I don't I did send a bad precedent that.

18
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,920
I hope everyone had a lovely festive period.

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,260
Um, yeah, no, no, it was good.

20
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,700
I played a lot of board games.

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,300
I dri a I ate a prodigious quantity of cheese.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:25,780
Do

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,180
Prodigious.

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,260
Well we had twenty two cheeses.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,780
Twenty two cheeses?

26
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,140
That's quite a lot of cheese.

27
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,860
Yeah.

28
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,260
I

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,600
Quite a lot less cheese than Allison, I think, is the answer.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,160
It's not hard to eat less cheese than Allison.

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,080
I have persuaded all my family that what we need is consumable.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,120
Christmas presents and several different people bought us cheese this year.

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,240
Plus I kinda panicked and bought a load of cheese in just in case there wasn't enough cheese.

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,320
There's still some cheese.

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,520
It's fantastic.

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,800
Oh, I don't know if I've ever told this story on the podcast.

37
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:08,619
When I was eighteen, my my mum I'd I'd learnt to drive, so I could be sent on errands, and my mother gave me twenty pounds and the instructions to go to Waitrose and buy Brie.

38
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,700
What do you suppose I did?

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,680
Bought twenty pounds worth of brie.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,320
Alright.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,000
Liz, can you say bought twenty pounds worth of brie because Alison's currently got a mouthful of cranona?

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,520
Porridge, yes.

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,440
Bought twenty pounds worth of brie?

44
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,860
Yes.

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,540
And then I got home and she said, Oh put the change on the counter and I said, What change?

46
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,860
And she went, You don't mean to say you've spent twenty pounds on Brie and I said, Yeah

47
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,420
What else did you want me to do?

48
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:40,700
Anyway, this has passed into legend as a funny thing that John did at Christmas, but I maintain it was the reasonable thing to do.

49
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,480
You know, other soft French cheeses are available.

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,120
I wasn't asked to buy the other soft French cheeses.

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, I mean the the main problem is that it's too much Brie and not enough other non Brie cheeses.

52
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,160
Having trouble with this concept 'cause I feel like you said too much Brie there.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,640
Yeah, too much brie without you know, you want a balanced cheese board.

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,160
Johnny's just bought twenty pounds worth of brie and now there is no money for other cheese.

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,239
To be fair, I'm sure there was money for other cheese.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,520
Really, come on.

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,800
Yes, I think it's fair to say, I mean I don't want to

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:19,440
I I I d I don't want to um oversell our wealth as a family, but I will say that there was probably more than twenty pounds available for cheese at Christmas.

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,040
Which is its own form of privilege.

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,640
It's so oh yeah, so much.

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,400
Check your cheese privilege.

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,000
But also I find that when I have a balanced cheese board, it is common for the soft white French cheese to run out first, so

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,880
I don't think it's insane to have a cheese board that is oversupplied in brie.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,200
I was worried we wouldn't have enough to talk about this episode, but I forgot that we could discuss cheese apparently.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,160
Thank you to everyone who uh wrote us letters of comments.

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,800
I am gonna get the ball rolling.

67
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,280
Casella wrote on

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:02,320
Blue Sky saying, sorry if I missed it, but I've been waiting for weeks now on the whole MathMos business, assuming it was an intricate Barbarella joke setup.

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,519
But apparently not.

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,560
And then um Hispania uh linked um there were there was a group chat where people were like, what is he talking about?

71
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,220
An Hispania linked Barbarello Meets the Matmos, so I'll put a link in the show notes.

72
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,980
But no, we were in fact not just uh in a Barbarella-themed joke with Emily Tesch.

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,800
uh we do not have that level of foresight or planning.

74
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,600
Um but it is very funny so thank you very much Cassella.

75
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,160
Hang on though Barbarella meets the Mat Mouse.

76
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,699
Yeah.

77
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,500
Matmas.

78
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:33,220
So that's probably not the origin of the term in the first place.

79
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,940
I don't think Cassella is arguing that that's the etymology of the tone Cambridge.

80
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:41,220
Although Cassella, if that was the argument, please write in.

81
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,720
No, I th I thought his argument was that we had made this whole thing up from whole cloth as a barbarella joke.

82
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,280
Oh that that would be elaborate for us.

83
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:59,560
The yeah, the one that would be a very elaborate set of forward planning required from us and we would have had to pull Emily Tesh in on the whole joke and indeed the whole audience of your Novicon live pod.

84
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,039
Yeah, your your typical Novicon audience of Cambridge Math Mose.

85
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,360
I just wanna say, you know, um sorry to Cassella, this is in fact real.

86
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,240
This is how

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
Daft it is.

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,760
And I think I think it's worth noting that it is it is probably fair to say that Cambridge University is less believable than Barbarella.

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,080
I can having spent three years at Cambridge University and only two hours in Barbarella, I can confirm.

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
Uh yes, indeed.

91
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,200
So thank you very much, Casella.

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,840
We heard from Paul Weimer, who uh discussed T shirt versus fleets versus shorts weather, the ongoing conundrum.

93
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
Um and he says nine degrees here in Minneapolis.

94
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,480
St.

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Paul is t shirt and grilling weather.

96
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
Uh no.

97
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:53,640
You may you may not know this listeners, but I normally live in a very warm place, and currently I am in the UK where it is not very warm, and I have complained about it near

98
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,200
Additional to this our houses are kind of bad.

99
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,480
I mean not everybody's, but certainly mine has cold bits and I'm sitting in one of them.

100
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,560
Um to record the podcast.

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,919
I've been sitting in perfectly nice warm insulated houses.

102
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,360
Including John's house, but maybe not John's attic.

103
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
I gave you the thick duveilers.

104
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,380
You did.

105
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,420
I had to get and then I had to get the second duvet out.

106
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,620
Yeah, that is fair.

107
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,100
Um

108
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,780
It turns out you can take the girl out of Lancashire and you can take the Lancashire out of the girl.

109
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,819
Paul also says that Nuremberg vs.

110
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,060
Australia is a tough choice.

111
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,419
Uh because yeah, like

112
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,199
And points out that the the Australian one is timed for the for the lunar eclipse.

113
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,159
Solar eclipse.

114
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,199
Solar eclipse.

115
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,560
So that is an extra added thing if you are going on an adventure.

116
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,160
Sorry, solar eclipse, solar eclipse.

117
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,520
Uh Paul actually said solstice, but I think he means solar eclipse.

118
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,199
So I was inferring anyway.

119
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,600
Yeah, we have solstices twice a year, Paul.

120
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
Three times on uh leap years.

121
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,199
That's true.

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
That is a red memo.

123
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,680
Is that a civil service slang for bollocks?

124
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,479
Uh no, it's a blueprint slang for bollocks.

125
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,680
Okay, cool.

126
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Uh the solar eclipse is in Australia.

127
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
It's worth noting it's not in Brisbane.

128
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,960
I am slightly like you would still have to go and stay in a different city after after the world con.

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,560
to see the the solar eclipse and Australia's big enough that that is perhaps non-trivial.

130
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,440
Being Australia that could be eight thousand miles away.

131
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,120
I got an app, listeners.

132
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:38,720
This app I don't think exists on Android, so sorry to the Androiders among you, but there is an app called Eclipse Live, which shows the next like hundred years of eclipses and their paths on the Earth, and you can filter by like types of eclipse and stuff.

133
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:45,320
It goes through Sydney, which is not too far south of Brisbane, sort of relatively speaking to Australia.

134
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,960
Does also go through like a large part of the bit of Australia that's not got anyone in it, so

135
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,600
If you've got a tent and a camper van, you can probably find somewhere to see it.

136
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,720
July 2028.

137
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,640
Yeah, I think it's a reasonable assumption that most of the people going to Australia will probably go to more than one city anyway.

138
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,160
Yeah.

139
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,320
No, and it is quite easy in Australia to get to some very dark places.

140
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:15,960
So we heard a lot about Rwanda um and especially on the visa topic.

141
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,520
So

142
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:23,340
Um Casella and Tammy wrote on Blue Sky about Rwanda.

143
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,220
So Tammy highlighted that multiple people applied for visas and

144
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,760
Meg MacDonald wrote in the Facebook comments that I think it was eight people applied and were denied.

145
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:40,360
File seven seventy has the um scoop in which Tammy says the Swedish authorities are remarkably frank about their prejudices.

146
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:47,019
Uh and also notes that personalized invitation letters were issued despite the reaction of the Swedish authorities.

147
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,459
Frederick Coulter wrote in our Facebook

148
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,500
He's been supporting the Chigali bid because he thinks widening the WorldCon audience is a good thing and he's never been to Chigali.

149
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,780
I've never been to Africa.

150
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,940
I've been to Morocco, but I really kinda think there's some very real senses in which that doesn't count.

151
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:16,500
Well that's interesting because what Frederick suggests and Lillian Edwards highlighted is that it might be that having Morocco as a WorldCon destination, like for example Casablanca

152
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
might be a good way to have an African worldcom that gets around some of these visa issues.

153
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,680
Lilin also says Morocco isn't really Africa in that kind of sense.

154
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,960
It's like a much more

155
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,100
uh on the European side of things.

156
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:34,300
And then says maybe Cape Town in South Africa would be a good venue if you wanted to have an African WorldCon.

157
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,579
So so this is a sort of suggestion that what the WorldCon might need is Africa Lite TM

158
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,380
Well I think what you do is you do what you can to build the momentum, right?

159
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,340
Um and so I don't think anyone's suggesting I don't know if Africa Lights the right framing, because I don't think

160
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,780
I think that has a kind of a pejorative sense that I don't think is intended.

161
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,580
Oh yeah, no it was one hundred percent intended.

162
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:58,940
By me.

163
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:09,500
By well in that case, I think the idea is if you can start if you can have an African WorldCon in a place where it's possible, can you then build to having an African WorldCon somewhere where it's much harder?

164
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:17,520
So Meg notes, um, as someone who works in HEI the rate of visa denial no longer surprises her at all, and that is it's sad but true.

165
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,320
And I don't know how you get around any of this stuff, which is a great shame.

166
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,160
We did hear from Tommy Ferguson by email.

167
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,760
Tommy linked us to the Corruption Perceptions Index.

168
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:39,200
And Rwanda has a score of uh fifty-seven out of a hundred and is forty-third out of a hundred and eighty around the world.

169
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,839
Is that thirty-third most corrupt or thirty-third least corrupt?

170
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,780
So Denmark is the first ranked.

171
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,540
So I think forty-third means that it's the forty-third least corrupt country.

172
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,540
out of 180.

173
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,340
I feel like that's actually quite good.

174
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,740
Well, yeah, so what Tommy basically says is 43 is not bad, but

175
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,340
He says given its location, he would still be looking at restricting engagement with a country at this rating and would be looking at payment controls.

176
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,380
Looking at the list, it seems like it's probably

177
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,000
one of if not the highest African country in terms of its in terms of its ranking on this metric.

178
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,480
It's much higher than Morocco, for instance.

179
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:20,980
Yeah.

180
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,500
I was about to say that.

181
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,940
Much higher than Morocco.

182
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,700
You know, which is a a h a a a common holiday destination.

183
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,620
It's it's higher than Spain and Italy.

184
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,140
For instance.

185
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,500
It's it's higher than China, it's higher than South Africa.

186
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,780
Yeah, so so and it's also increasing sharply recently.

187
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,060
So one of the things that's going on here is Rwanda is clearly

188
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,160
trying to be taken seriously as a safe international country.

189
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,440
And is is suffering some perception issues with that.

190
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,160
Yes.

191
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,600
I think we should not get too f deep into to international

192
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,260
politics and perceptions of Rwanda because it is complicated and I don't think we can really do it soup super full justice.

193
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,940
I I'm wary to draw too many conclusions because obviously we're not experts.

194
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,440
It is.

195
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
It was interesting to hear from someone who is.

196
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,160
So thank you very much, Tommy.

197
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,600
I guess the question is, do we want an African WorldCon for the sake of having an African WorldCon, in which case, like Morocco slash Casablanca might be the way to go?

198
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,880
Or is it because we want to accurately

199
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:26,360
bring in parts of the international community in which case Chigali is the place that seems to actually have some fans who would like to hang out or well

200
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:34,560
Chigali is the place where African fans seem to quite want us to come and hang out, so maybe we should be like not saying, well, have you thought about this place?

201
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,280
It's more acceptable to the Western side of things.

202
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,080
Or is that useful to build momentum?

203
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,920
I think it's a really hard discussion.

204
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:50,360
I'm mostly just heartbroken at how hard it is for the people to actually participate in in the fandom, because it's very sad.

205
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,080
Yeah, I mean eight eight denials out of eight is a lot and a lot of work and a lot of expense.

206
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,840
I think I'd also just say that no, like Rwanda to Morocco is

207
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,580
Quite some distance?

208
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,140
Hmm.

209
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,620
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,580
Well that's everything, right?

211
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,460
Africa's huge.

212
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,380
And the flights internally are not as well joined up.

213
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,980
So it may be that actually that is not a particularly easy destination.

214
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,660
for African fandom to get to anyway, even if they can get visas.

215
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:23,260
So I think I'm with the if they would like to try it in Chicali, let's like help them do it in Chicali, rather than suggesting

216
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,480
you know, do it somewhere else.

217
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
And I think it was a well meaning suggestion.

218
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
I think it's an interesting thought experiment.

219
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,600
But yeah, I don't know I don't know that it's the best way.

220
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:39,960
Another thing that was written on Facebook is uh Meg corrected us, uh, SmothCon43 is being co-chaired by Esther and Vince Doherty.

221
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,380
We got a letter from Christopher J.

222
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,100
Garcia.

223
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,580
Yo.

224
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,980
He says, Jolly Crimbo to y'all.

225
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,260
Hey, Jolly Crimbo, Chris.

226
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
I've never said Jolly Krimbo.

227
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
We could tell from the delivery.

228
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,600
I don't think I have either to be fair.

229
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,720
Uh he also says I am chaotic question mark.

230
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
Let's leave that as a question

231
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,779
for the listeners to answer in the privacy of their own homes, Chris.

232
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,139
Um yeah, he's found some jugger teams in California and is gonna go and buy some merch.

233
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,180
Yeah, and b basically the best thing anyone can do for a seated world con is to throw money at them, which maybe I'll be correct.

234
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,700
This is r relv related to our discussion of Montreal, which we'll come back to later.

235
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,700
But yeah, basically buying memberships and throwing money at them is a great big thing you can.

236
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:33,900
Yes.

237
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,320
The it's the three stats for a world con in ZooCon are people, good will, and finance.

238
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,680
And if you can materially increase any of those points

239
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,740
then you are doing good for that worldcon.

240
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,620
And you know, so volunteering and giving the money to excellent ways to help out.

241
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,780
And he says that Nairobi is the African city WorldCon should hit first.

242
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,580
Possibly.

243
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,620
Interesting.

244
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,220
Yeah, I think that's probably true.

245
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,140
Well uh certainly an argument.

246
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,060
Having seen the Weeble and Bob uh video

247
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,180
About Kenya, I agree.

248
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,740
I mean it's I guess I have been to Kenya and I have successfully, you know, paid for things in Kenya and had no problem with banking and so on.

249
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,620
So he's probably right for the average punter there.

250
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,860
I haven't spent any time in Nairobi though.

251
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,120
Uh it does have lions.

252
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,160
I can tell you that one.

253
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,120
It's also got tigers and it pisses all over Norway.

254
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,880
Would you like photos of lions for the cover art this week?

255
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,839
Uh yes.

256
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,560
Obviously.

257
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,240
Yeah, let's just do that.

258
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,960
I co I could do with I could do with a week off art.

259
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,680
Alright.

260
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,560
Sounds good to me.

261
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,360
Uh and that's that's Chris's potted lock.

262
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,480
I if you could get three lions in a row

263
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,060
I do have three lines in a row.

264
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,940
Yeah, and if and if and if two of them could be wearing glasses.

265
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:45,660
Mmm.

266
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,420
And that might be a stretch.

267
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,980
Might need some Photoshop.

268
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,300
Photoshop is something I can definitely do.

269
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,680
Okay.

270
00:15:53,080 --> 00:16:04,840
Um I have linked to the Weeble and Bob video, Where Can You See Lions in the show notes, listeners, and if you want a slice of early internet, then it is available for you.

271
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,440
The weird thing is

272
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,240
I don't think I've ever seen this one.

273
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,600
I could have sworn I'd seen all of You never see Lions again ya.

274
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,760
It's an absolute classic.

275
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,240
I know.

276
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,199
It's one of the foundational texts of my whole personality, which is a bit worrying, but there you are.

277
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,360
I mean, I've been earworm with it now and we'll have it for the rest of the day, so

278
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,400
I'm just waiting to see if I can hear the sound of where can you see lions leaking out of Alison's headphones.

279
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
Alison looks absolutely delighted, listeners.

280
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,480
Her face is agape, her hands are up, she looks she's radiant.

281
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:43,940
We're going to Kenya A free snorkel with every biscuit.

282
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,460
Yes.

283
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:47,860
Yes.

284
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,220
No, I've never seen that one.

285
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,420
I am I am I would suggest I'm probably better versed in early internet memes than

286
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,400
Any of the rest of us?

287
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,760
I can't do memes now, though my children sometimes send me them.

288
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,480
Yeah, I mean I think the other th but the the thing I would say, Alison, is that

289
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,720
When I was looking at internet memes, you had small children, so Oh yeah, no n no my my internet memes are way before that.

290
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,640
They're like hamster dance and all your bass that belong to that and okay.

291
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,440
Yes.

292
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,400
Yes

293
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm aware of all internet traditions, Alison.

294
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,920
Um I don't we uh we we we know the forms.

295
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,120
We know the ancient words

296
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:39,080
I mean, okay, I'm just gonna say I'm not I'm not gonna try and but I did get the first spam message along with a lot of other people, right?

297
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,440
But but that was cool.

298
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,460
Everyone sit around and what Mar Allison tells you stories.

299
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,019
Right.

300
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,100
Did Chris say anything else, Liz, or was it just a very brief lock this week?

301
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,340
Uh he did also uh talk about hotel breakfasts.

302
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,540
Oh yeah.

303
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,140
I like hotel breakfasts.

304
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,980
Everyone likes hotel breakfasts.

305
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,620
We also heard from Tommy Ferguson again.

306
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:11,300
He said on Smovcon, he's still sad that he missed it, but could confirm on the organizational front, especially for newcomers, that everything you said was true.

307
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:20,639
Amanda Sloan attended on her for her first time on a bursary from Reconnect, and there was nothing for her to register, say hello, or signage on the Friday.

308
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,799
She didn't know very anyone, and it wasn't really until Saturday that she met a few people that

309
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,520
that James and I have pointed her towards, mainly through the fan tables.

310
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
It was a really disappointing start for someone who I think will be a great com runner in the future.

311
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:41,400
So this is something that Lisbon will be looking at and I'm sure Lisbon are already looking at it and I know that Lisbon some some members of the Lisbon team listen to this podcast, so go.

312
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,000
if you've got newcon runners th they need nurturing and and attention.

313
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,760
Um Tommy also says his weekend runs are getting longer, so you will have to make your episodes longer.

314
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,960
I'm going to suggest, Tommy, that you should just run faster.

315
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,820
It's good advice.

316
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,340
That's the standard of sports coaching you're gonna get from Octothorpe.

317
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,940
Run us right in.

318
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,299
But no, I don't think we're gonna make the episodes longer, but we can recommend other podcasts you might like to listen to.

319
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,100
Hugo, Girl! and Critical Friends and A Meal of Thorns.

320
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,500
We should probably do at some point we should make this into a topic because we haven't talked about other fan casts for a while and we probably ought to.

321
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,500
So thank you for the nudge, Tommy.

322
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:32,180
We also heard from Darren Briskman, but we're going to promote this into a full segment, listeners.

323
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:45,059
Um, because Darren is the co-chair of Montreal 2027 and he wrote in with a uh PDF of the Montreal org chart.

324
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,100
I and I do love an org.

325
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,940
Oh, you know I love an org.

326
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,500
And he says, we're very happy you've been discussing our upcoming WorldCon on the podcast, and we always appreciate helpful criticism.

327
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,540
He says that

328
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,600
He knows they need a new website and there is now a new website which is available.

329
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,720
We'll talk about that in a second.

330
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
And then he says, uh, I was surprised to hear the comment about perceived failures of recruiting.

331
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,780
We have a full slate of division heads and a nearly full slate of deputy division heads and most of our area heads.

332
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,060
We're strong believers it's never too early to recruit.

333
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:20,460
and engaged staff and with strong believers in asking in seeking to recruit leaders and volunteers who haven't yet participated.

334
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:16,660
We

335
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,419
He attached a copy of the current org chart.

336
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:33,580
And then he says um it was d apparently it was available in the information packet that was part of the Smovcon QA, um which we did not spot.

337
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,679
Um, but he says that you are unaware of this helps us understand we need to be more assertive in communicating the status of our recruiting.

338
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I would say that the new Montreal website does not have a copy of this on it that I can see.

339
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:54,060
When I go to a convention's website, and I know this might just be me, but the committee and staff list is normally the first place I look.

340
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:02,919
I don't think it's the first place I look, but it's often one of the things that I do want sort of you know, it's on one of the things I expect to see and I will go to the website to try and find that information.

341
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,640
So I will say I will say nice little nice little webpage with all of this on would be would be top notch.

342
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:17,600
But um I will find it on the SmothCon website and I will link it in the show notes listeners so you can follow along.

343
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
But I have a copy open and we can talk a little bit about it today.

344
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,020
Is it definitely on the SmofCon website?

345
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,980
Uh I'm I should double check, shouldn't I?

346
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,180
Doot do do do.

347
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,020
Well that's tricky because

348
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,700
Uh it's actually genuinely unclear to me that the things are still on the SmothCon website at all.

349
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,220
Hold on.

350
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,420
We linked a bunch of these in the previous We did.

351
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,660
Oh Future Conventions Q<unk>A.

352
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,100
It's gone, hasn't it?

353
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,140
Has it actually gone?

354
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,500
It's not just me being daft.

355
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,100
It's like a blank page.

356
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,580
Yeah, okay, so I'm gonna say

357
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:00,360
Further to SmothCon being, I'm gonna say it at this point, a shower, um, the QAs are no longer available on the SmothCon website.

358
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,280
They've been deleted, which is

359
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:05,559
An astoundingly community hostile thing to do.

360
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,559
Okay, so the Q<unk>A's are still there, they're just unlinked, I think.

361
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,200
Because I found some links on file seven seventy and they still exist.

362
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,760
So let's see if it got crawled by the Wayback Machine.

363
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,640
It's not.

364
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,680
Tumbleweed just scrolling across the screen as we're like, can we guess the Montreal PDF?

365
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:33,480
No, because they're not obvious obviously named things, they're like randomly named things.

366
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,800
So we've got this PDF.

367
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,920
We'll try and put a copy of it in the show notes, listeners.

368
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,400
I'll

369
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:48,780
pop it in my dropbox and make a link that way because if it I I think I'm gonna take Darren at his word that it was already publicly available and therefore assume it is fine for us to disseminate it.

370
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,060
So it will be in the show notes.

371
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,580
But Montreal

372
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,980
Put your organization chart on your website.

373
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,580
Ideally not as a PDF.

374
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,780
Ideally ideally as a actual webpage.

375
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,220
But if all we could get is a PDF, that's better than nothing.

376
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,940
Guys, I found I found it.

377
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:07,780
Hoy I found the Montreal QA.

378
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,140
It only lists their uh division heads.

379
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,380
That's the list we'd seen last time.

380
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,519
Yeah, so there's extra stuff in that old chart.

381
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,480
Uh i this may also be um slightly out of date because I've just pulled out the one I could find in the Wayback Machine.

382
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,600
Oh right, okay.

383
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,300
So it's possible it's old.

384
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,060
This is the one I remember seeing.

385
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,740
You think it's the one that was handed out?

386
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,140
Okay.

387
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,660
It probably is up to date, but there might have been a later version we didn't see.

388
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,600
Because I have to pull them out of the Wayback Machine 'cause all the links have gone.

389
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:44,760
So I'm still hammering your website for the download if that was a bandwidth problem because I fished out of the Wayback Machine and then download it from the site.

390
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,960
So they're not gone.

391
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,120
So it's not probably not saving you like

392
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,240
like downloads if that was the what they were trying to do.

393
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,840
So that's bad fired as well.

394
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,840
And also like if it was a bandwidth thing, put them on Dropbox and just link to Dropbox.

395
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,520
Like there are ways around that.

396
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,940
But anyway, yeah, so this has some interesting information in it.

397
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,500
So it restates all of the uh division heads we knew.

398
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,820
Um it makes it clear that there is an online operations division, which I don't think we knew was a thing.

399
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,420
uh and that has no uh division head or deputy division head yet.

400
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,660
And it also makes it public who the deputy division heads are.

401
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:30,280
So we can say that the Deputy Division Head for Exhibits, going in alphabetical order, the Deputy Division Heads for Exhibits is Rene Walling.

402
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,200
The Deputy Division Heads for Finance are Joanne Lawler and Sam Shiner.

403
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,980
The Deputy Division Head for Member Services is Saul Jaffer.

404
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,540
Apologies if I've uh pronounced your surname wrong, Saul.

405
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,660
The Deputy Division Head for Programme is Gary Feldbaum.

406
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,620
The Deputy Division Head for Tech is Paul Timmins.

407
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:54,520
uh who has a note saying that he is specifically uh IT um and then Linda Deneroff is the last DDH and she is Wussfuss

408
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:02,299
And then there is uh some information on area heads which So um what do we think about these Deputy Division heads, guys?

409
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,260
Uh there's one in particular I think we might discuss.

410
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:13,940
Montreal said that one of the things it was going to do was to rehabilitate people who had served their time and that is clearly a reference to the fact that um

411
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,580
Renault Walling is one of their DDHers.

412
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,660
I I think it's been a long time.

413
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,300
I think that's kind of okay, actually.

414
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,340
Um

415
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:31,640
You know, René was extremely apologetic and said he would work better, and that was like over ten years ago, so I feel like that's probably all right.

416
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:40,360
Yeah, I feel like we may need to give some context for listeners who, you know, were not around many years ago on the internet like we were.

417
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,000
So so we we can link two uh page about this, but essentially in

418
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:59,760
Uh twenty twelve, uh an incident of harassment was reported at Redacon, perpetrated by Renee Walling, um, and he was given a two year ban, uh which was later revised to a lifetime ban from Redacon.

419
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:01,539
So yeah, that was twenty twelve.

420
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,899
That was thirteen years ago.

421
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:09,380
I think my comment would be i it's kinda weird to say we are doing like rehabilitation.

422
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,580
'Cause what I would say is it is a while ago, but I don't think I've heard anything at all from Renne, which is probably

423
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,960
As you would expect.

424
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,880
You know, you disappear from Fandam and, you know, do other things.

425
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,840
But I think there will be issues here because

426
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:33,760
What there isn't is any kind of demonstration of anything that has happened in the intervening years, um, because he's been kind of very much in the background

427
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:46,860
So I I guess the issue is and we've discussed this, like if you are going to do this sort of, you know, transformative justice kind of work, then probably you need to be able to show people the work.

428
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,460
And I don't think we've seen that.

429
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:52,539
And possibly they are planning to, you know, discuss this more openly.

430
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,020
But I think there will definitely be some discussion of his position in a

431
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,040
very high level at the um Montreal committee.

432
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:08,520
The problem is that when you let people into a community, you have to think about the people whom that tacitly discourages.

433
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,480
So like it's the parable of the Nazi bar, right?

434
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:20,720
If you have a bar and you're tolerant of Nazis, even if you don't let them be Nazis, if you just let them be in there, any person who comes in and sees the tattoos and doesn't want to be associated with that w will that will leave.

435
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,760
And eventually what you find is you have a bar where only Nazis drink, because you've been tolerant to a point where

436
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,019
only the intolerant people are actually coming.

437
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:33,139
And there's stuff like the t the parado paradox of tolerance and things like that, which which tie into this.

438
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,179
Where it's basically like to make an inclusive space, you actually have to do some include exclusion.

439
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,700
And the problem here is

440
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,200
That Rene might have served his time.

441
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,120
Rene might be genuinely sorry.

442
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,800
Um but that doesn't matter

443
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:57,720
If having Rene as the deputy division head of exhibits makes anyone who has a problem with his previous behavior want to not be involved with your convention, and those people will primarily

444
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,780
Maybe not ho they won't they won't wholly be women, but it will definitely skew towards women.

445
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:11,420
And so you're basically making quite a this is quite an uninclusive move, and it is an uninclusive mood which will affect women more than it affects men.

446
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,620
And that is a thing I would not want to do if I were a WorldCon chair.

447
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,380
Even if he is sorry, it will still put more women off than it puts off men that he is involved at all.

448
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,059
And that is a problem, I think.

449
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:32,640
I entirely understand where you're coming from on this, but I this is the approach that means that it's very hard for people who've been imprisoned to get jobs.

450
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:40,420
people go, oh oh I I don't care that he w served six months, eight years ago, but um uh

451
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,340
But but I'm not having him working in my business, you know.

452
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,620
And I I feel like th this is a real problem.

453
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,780
We have to accept

454
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,780
That that people can change and get better.

455
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,740
I agree with that, but I think it's a lot easier to accept that someone's changed and got better.

456
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,640
if you see the work they've done, which I think is the point Liz made, it's not clear to me what the work there is.

457
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:13,320
And the fact that they haven't said I actually think the fact that they haven't hung a lantern on this and said, like, we're gonna do this and we want Renee to be involved and we think he's served his time and like

458
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,840
you know, here's a you know, here's his take on it and stuff.

459
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,040
I think I would say two things.

460
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,120
One is I mean, it's not a job.

461
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
It's it this is your hobby.

462
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,120
It is personally harsh if you say to someone you can't be on our committee because

463
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:39,760
you know, because of your personal actions from twelve years ago and that we don't think there's any way to change that, but it's not gonna prevent you know, it it's not like gonna leave people destitute or anything like that.

464
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,640
I think so I think there is a bit of a difference there.

465
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,600
I I will say I agree with Alison.

466
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,520
I do think rehabilitation is important.

467
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,080
I do.

468
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,240
It's been a long time, guys.

469
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,960
But then that's the question is, should it just be should it just be time?

470
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,280
Should it just be time?

471
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,720
And secondly, does it matter if you lose a lot of volunteer resource because of this decision?

472
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,400
That is bad for your WorldCon.

473
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,780
I guess and that's I know I guess that's a choice you can make eyes wide open.

474
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:17,900
If you're like, you know, we gotta start it somewhere, we think this is philosophically an important thing to do, and we're happy to reduce our volunteering because we think this is an important thing to do.

475
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,039
That's a fair choice.

476
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:26,799
But again, I think you need like a letter from the chair explaining that or like setting out that philosophical perspective.

477
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,720
Like you need they need to hang a lantern on it and make this case.

478
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,560
Um I think what you'd say is we're we've recruited Rene into this role.

479
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,120
He's learnt his lesson, he he has not exhibited any more

480
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,580
untoward behaviour, which I believe is true.

481
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,900
Um we hope that won't cause anyone to um feel uncomfortable about volunteering for the convention.

482
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,460
Um and I'm very happy to talk to anyone who is concerned.

483
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,340
Something like that.

484
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,740
You know, hang a lantern on it, as you say.

485
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,600
I don't think they've hung a lantern on it, have they?

486
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,400
And I don't I will also say for those who aren't as familiar with this, we will try and dig out some resources um from the time.

487
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:11,820
But I also believe I'm right in saying that there wasn't like a huge number of accusations.

488
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,779
There are a lot of people who basically said he's a bit weird.

489
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,500
But there wasn't like it wasn't like one person made a complaint and then twenty others came forward.

490
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,779
I I think maybe one other came forward and I think

491
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:37,220
Uh i this is a case where people go, no, Rene was a kind of awkward dog to a degree that I and I know that that is used as a cover up for a lot of people who are predators, but you know, I don't

492
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,100
I think I agree with all of that.

493
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,900
But and I think there's also a thing here which is Liz's point about it it's not a job, it's volunteering.

494
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,500
Like I think we should let

495
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:10,179
If you go to prison for murder and you are then released, I think you should be able to get a job afterwards, and I think it is possible to be sort of sorry and reintegrate society after you've murdered someone.

496
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:19,320
Although I am not sure that if there was a uh murderer who'd been to jail and then had been released, I'd want them like working dealers from an Easter Con.

497
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
Because those are different things.

498
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,240
Like there's a thing there about volunteer positions and building communities that is a bit different from

499
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,580
Letting people work to make money to live.

500
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:36,540
And I don't know exactly where that line is, and I'm not sure I've got the social science background to confidently draw it.

501
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,820
Uh and I suspect there's an awful lot of people who have thought a lot about this that I'm unaware of.

502
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
But it is tricky because these aren't jobs.

503
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,200
These are volunteer positions in organizations that are being run as hobby projects and

504
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,760
That makes it harder.

505
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:58,280
Well, I think what I would say is about you know, Alison's proposed statement, which I would agree with, is words are not actions.

506
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,520
It doesn't say he'll be working in this position and

507
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,560
What we are gonna do is anyone in this division will be able to go straight to the chair and discuss anything they feel like.

508
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,360
And also

509
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:19,140
We will be running a series of workshops on how to combat sexual harassment in your convention and how to create an environment which is welcoming and things like that.

510
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,420
Like there is more you could do.

511
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,660
I will also notice note that

512
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,440
For instance, there is no code of conduct area head yet.

513
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,880
And I think that's the other thing.

514
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,440
If you are going to make someone who has been accused in the past of this sort of thing one of your DDHs

515
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:40,659
You need to have those policies, you need to have those roots.

516
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,059
They need to be in place before you make that appointment.

517
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,299
And that's unfair because I think a lot of other conventions could do that a lot later.

518
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,919
But if you are going to do the rehabilitation, you need to make damn sure that you have your safety procedures in place before you start trying to do that.

519
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,880
And I am not confident Montreal has achieved that.

520
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,080
They've got a code of conduct.

521
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:06,720
They have a code of conduct, but like they don't have anyone who's in place to be the code of conduct person, and I don't see anyone else who's like in charge of

522
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,580
safety or listeners or anything like that.

523
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,380
You know?

524
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:18,500
Like having a code of conduct's great start, but it is not enough for a convention where you have appointed

525
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:24,020
someone with those previous accusations to a position of that seniority, I think.

526
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,980
And I freely admit that is not a standard I would hold a WorldCon to if they had not taken this decision.

527
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,820
But I think it is fair to hold a WorldCon that does take this decision to that standard.

528
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,220
Yeah, and I think also you need to the code of conduct um

529
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:45,379
Is totally fine but it also reads very much about the convention and not about the pre convention lead up.

530
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,020
Um

531
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:53,639
So then you need to make sure and make it clear that your code of conduct applies to all precon activities and volunteers and so on.

532
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:08,579
I I do feel a bit sorry for Montreal here because I realise that they have uh you know, in good faith emailed us a copy of their old chart so we can see that they do have a bunch of people in place and are doing, you know, reasonably well at recruiting and and staffing up, although there are obviously still quite a lot of gaps.

533
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:09,579
to be filled.

534
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,579
Um but what it has unintentionally done is given us this entirely separate discussion.

535
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,980
I mean I think like and I think there are some positive things about this org chart, right?

536
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,780
Like finance seems to be mostly staffed, which is good.

537
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,260
Um the communications division seems to be mostly staffed.

538
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,619
Um again I will say I think it is a problem

539
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,460
D Darren is also the area head of editing website content in the communications division.

540
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:40,260
And and at some point I do think you need to probably recruit someone specific for that.

541
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,140
Um because I don't think it should be a chairs level job because the chair is probably busy.

542
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,020
The Worcester Division has some area heads, it's mostly the usual suspects.

543
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:54,700
Keith Smith and David Wiener are the website infrastructure area heads in the tech division.

544
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,020
And Keith has worked on E's to cons.

545
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,100
I'm assuming it's the same Keith Smith.

546
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,800
I don't know.

547
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:13,560
Smith is a common enough surname that I might be wrong, but like there is a New Zealand there is a New Zealander in British fandom called Keith Smith who does a lot with tech and things, listeners, and has done some good work over the past volunteering, and I'm assuming it is the same Keith Smith.

548
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,180
Apologies to both Keith's if I am wrong.

549
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:19,859
I I mean that Keith does not do websites.

550
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,900
So I think some um my assumption would be it's a different person.

551
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,920
They are stuffing up, it seems to be probably about where you would expect ish.

552
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,480
I don't know.

553
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,960
I don't habitually scrutinize WorldCon old charts.

554
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:34,339
you know, eighteen months out.

555
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,619
No, it's tricky.

556
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:41,779
I do worry that we're holding Montreal to a different standard to other world cons, but it's

557
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:51,960
I don't know whether that's just because we're I think the problem and this echoes something we said last time, which is once you're grumpy with a convention, you start paying more attention and that snowballs.

558
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Whereas if a convention's doing well

559
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,760
it can often escape that level of scrutiny, which isn't fair, but I think is true.

560
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,359
And I don't think it's only I is just true of the whole shebang.

561
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,920
I don't think it's like just true of the three of us

562
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,380
Yeah, exactly.

563
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:18,900
I think we are I'm probably being harsher to them um because we have been harsh to them until now I'm scrutinizing everything they do um in a way that I'm not like

564
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,980
looking at LA's committee and stuff and going, ooh, that division head is an area head.

565
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:32,340
There was a thing that Montreal released about giving people second chances some time before the bid.

566
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:42,460
And I said, Oh, at the time, oh, that must mean that they've got Renee Walling as a division head which means that I think that they were deliberately leaving

567
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:43,160
Renee's name.

568
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,520
But it the the the the org chart that went to SmovCon was division heads only, it wasn't the full org chart.

569
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,280
Yeah, no, because the one that went to the s also the one that went to the SmovCon QA

570
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,220
is not necessarily one that they may have been distributing at Smothgotton, because I've seen people do this like on paper and so on.

571
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:05,740
I think basically because of their disorganization, it's very easy to jump to other explanations when probably it's just that

572
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,320
the left hand is not quite talking to the right hand and the website is obviously about a week old.

573
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,760
I don't yeah, I certainly don't think any of this stuff is being done in bad faith, if that makes sense.

574
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,880
Even if I

575
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,260
Disagree with it quite strongly.

576
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,819
I th I think got a little technical I've got a little technical issue for us.

577
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,859
Um Genevieve Valentine's original reports of

578
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:32,779
Her um harassment by Renee Wallinger no longer on the internet and they don't appear to have been copied out anywhere in terms.

579
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:35,740
As best I can remember it, he made

580
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,080
a number of comments which he thought were positive about her appearance, but she did not welcome.

581
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,520
She told him to stop.

582
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
He continually hounded her

583
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,800
later at the convention in order to try to apologize and explain how sorry she he was and ask for her forgiveness.

584
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,480
I ev and she told him to stop that and and he didn't and at at least at first.

585
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,780
And eventually he did stop, but he was very clueless about it.

586
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,180
So that's why it was persistent harassment.

587
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,020
But it was because he was trying to say sorry but but didn't realise that his apology was neither required nor welcome.

588
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,980
I think

589
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,660
I think that matches my recollection of how it went.

590
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:18,059
You can fish the report again out of the Wayback Machine.

591
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,420
No, I mean I literally as in I have just done that and I have found it.

592
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,220
Hey!

593
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:25,900
But I would also say that I think twenty twelve is I think

594
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:33,240
About when people were really starting to flip from, oh that guy is well meaning

595
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:48,279
but oblivious to his harassment, you should just ignore him and, you know, tell him to back off and I'm sure he'll back off to know this is actually a serious problem which is deterring a lot of people from coming to our conventions 'cause this happens over and over.

596
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:54,580
And yeah, I think it did lead to a big uh shift in how conventions treat it.

597
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,180
I think it led to us taking it more seriously, and that was a good thing.

598
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:05,960
But I do think this one incident probably this incident was repeated at many conventions around that time and did not become

599
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,500
quite the point of change that this one did.

600
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:18,940
And that must have been in part because Rene had been the chair of the two thousand and nine WorldCon, and s smoffs kind of gathered round him at first.

601
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,460
Ooh, did they?

602
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:28,280
Yes, Redacon gave him a two year ban rather than giving him a lifetime ban because of all the people going, Oh, really?

603
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,440
Uh despite the fact that they had a zero tolerance policy and uh commitment to lifetime bans for harassment.

604
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,240
I think what came out of that

605
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:46,520
Partly was that having zero tolerance policies that mandate lifetime bans with no um with no nuance at all

606
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,460
is not always the best way to write your policy.

607
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,619
Can someone who's not a man say that?

608
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,380
'Cause I think it's true, but maybe it shouldn't be me what says it.

609
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:59,020
I think it's fine and I think you can leave it like that.

610
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,080
I think it's fine, yeah.

611
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,200
Can I say can I say something before we move on?

612
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:03,920
Yeah.

613
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,800
I think I just want to say to listeners, our priorities in this community

614
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,440
are the safety, happiness, and well-being of everyone in the community.

615
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,080
And I really hope that it comes across that we have tried to conduct this discussion with um

616
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:29,640
thought, compassion, delicacy, and uh awareness of the safety of all attendees, including um those who are marginalized.

617
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,400
And we are we are attempting to have this discussion in good faith and I hope that came across in the preceding section.

618
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,140
So, uh moving on to a totally different topic

619
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:58,740
We got a letter from uh Hugo winner and fanwriter Renee, who has the Intergalactic Mixtape fanzine and also runs that giant Hugo spreadsheet with a very timely

620
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:09,119
uh letter featuring their new guide to how to participate in the Hugo Awards and it is a very good brief introduction

621
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:18,880
that tells you all the stuff you need to know about how you participate in the Hugo Awards and will make it kind of very friendly for new people who go, Oh, I've no idea how this works.

622
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,400
What are all these different types of memberships?

623
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:20,960
What do I do?

624
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,160
What is a Worcon?

625
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:34,359
And it kind of lays it all out and it's it's very well timed uh since the deadline is January 31st to join LA Con in order to get to nominate in the Hugos

626
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,039
John, I believe you have more information on this.

627
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:44,480
Molly Templeton, who is someone who writes for Reactor, among other things, and handles the Ursula K.

628
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,240
LeGuin Prize, among other other things.

629
00:42:48,359 --> 00:43:01,480
Basically skeeted, saying she had read Renee's newsletter and it reminded her of the conversations that she had had that year with curious, well-read folks who have no real idea how the Hugo voting process works, that anyone can do it, or that you get a voter bracket.

630
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,660
And this sparked a lot of discussion between Molly and Renee.

631
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:10,220
What came up was a discussion about gatekeeping.

632
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:20,240
And I highlighted that both Renee and Molly have platforms that they could use to demystify some of these processes in the way that we try to here.

633
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:29,340
And I said, one of the things from my background as a physics lecturer is that you have to be very careful when you're explaining things that can seem complicated.

634
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:38,420
that you don't start with, this is very complicated and hard to understand because that is a really good way of making people think that things are too complicated for them to bother with.

635
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:46,780
Um so one of the things you have to say is this will seem complicated, but actually I can explain it to you in a way that will make it much less complicated and then you will understand it.

636
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,160
And I have to do this with with plasma physics and things like that.

637
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:55,800
And I've used this tool in both lecturing and in terms of science communication with kind of primary school kids trying to explain to them.

638
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,299
fundamentals of how it all works.

639
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:03,339
And then, you know, we had a bit of a lively discussion, which I think was quite constructive.

640
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,619
And I said, like, one of the things we should do is we should work on

641
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:18,720
a resource that people can point to to be like, this is the simple explanation of how the Hugo Awards work, how they are voted on, how you can get involved and all of that.

642
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,339
And then I thought, yeah, we should definitely do that.

643
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,619
Uh and now it's five months later and uh Renee has written it.

644
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:35,140
uh and sent us a letter of comments with the uh resulting document which we will link in the show notes and this is very good.

645
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,980
Uh so Rene wrote a few

646
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,960
Weeks, months, I forget when.

647
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,480
It turns out it was ages.

648
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,359
What is time?

649
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,440
Um John and I tussled on Blue Sky regarding Hugo participation

650
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,060
Uh, don't remember the details because gestures to lif living in the fascist imperial corps.

651
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:50,620
Fair.

652
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:59,580
And uh her main takeaway was that we agreed that to solve the participation problem we had to stop making the Hugo process seem opaque even as a joke, because that joke's backfiring.

653
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:08,359
And uh a while back, Renee had an offline pal ask about the process and she had their first chance to explain without that it's hard joke and he appreciated it a lot.

654
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,000
And then

655
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:16,079
Renee had the brilliant idea to turn the email she wrote for him into a general guide that now lives with each Hugo spreadsheet.

656
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,480
And she says it's probably imperfect

657
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,380
It's written for non-Wusfuss people.

658
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,100
And I have read it and I think it's pretty damn good.

659
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,540
It's well it's well designed.

660
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,380
It's got nice little um ribbons next to each um little heading.

661
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,799
And it explains everything quite concisely.

662
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,039
And yeah, I think it's really good.

663
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,839
So this, I think, is 10 out of 10 smash in.

664
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,440
And we will link it in the show notes.

665
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,319
Yes.

666
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:49,740
And I would also say the the beauty of it being like a Google Doc is that it's got a big register for LA Con in the middle, a big button saying register for LA Con.

667
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,560
Which can obviously be updated every year to just point to the right spot.

668
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:01,560
And yes, I would say that the deadline for being a member of LA Con in order to nominate in the Hugos is the 31st of January.

669
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:15,940
They have just announced that they have virtual memberships available, which are eighty-five dollars, which will get you you'll be able to then nominate and vote in the Hugos and get the voter packet and have a access to all the online convention.

670
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:18,380
And I think that will include the business meeting, right?

671
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:20,700
You just have to be a virtual member, you don't have to be a full member.

672
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:21,099
Yeah.

673
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:21,660
Yeah.

674
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,420
No, that will include the business meeting.

675
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,220
Which is good, because I've just bought one.

676
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,980
About which I will say more in a minute.

677
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,260
I will say LA

678
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:42,660
With who are a bit mean to uh Montreal, I will also be slightly mean to LA, which is just put a great big like join LA button in the middle of your like in the middle of the top of your website or something.

679
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,500
And then on the actual registration page put a big like click here to join button.

680
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,580
Cause it's way down the page.

681
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,460
And Molly Templeton is the

682
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,300
Editor of Reactor.

683
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:01,460
Yeah, and so she has also in Reactor put a guide to how to vote in the Hugos.

684
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,360
I haven't seen if she has, but she might've done.

685
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,720
Anyone can vote in the Hugo Awards and here's how.

686
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,840
So so when you said as editor of Reactor Mag

687
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,080
you have this huge platform where you could be demystifying the process.

688
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,000
She took your advice, John.

689
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,720
You might have had a ding-dong with both Renee and

690
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,600
Molly, but they have both as a result published guides to how to vote at the Hugos.

691
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,240
So I think you should take some ding dong credit there.

692
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,040
I do

693
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,960
Try and only ding dong for good, not for evil.

694
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,240
Oh that's um I know there are a lot of reply guys on these.

695
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,460
Um, I to try.

696
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,940
I'm not sure I always succeed, and I think sometimes I could probably word things better.

697
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,340
But I am um I am very glad to see that on Reactor, because that is also fab.

698
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,500
And I think this is exactly what I wanted.

699
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,820
I think the more we publish ways to demystify this, the better we will all be for it.

700
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:58,339
And yeah, we will link to the reactor mag in the show notes.

701
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:05,859
So I will say that during the start of this podcast I was registering for LACOM.

702
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:14,099
Which all went very smoothly, but then I realized the phone call I've missed is my credit card company saying, Did you make a suspicious payment to lacom.

703
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:15,060
org?

704
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,740
and cancelling the payment.

705
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,900
So I'm gonna have to sort that out.

706
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:26,819
Um watch out overseas users um because I did have some problems getting that payment through.

707
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,619
And right now I have not paid but I do have membership.

708
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:30,180
So

709
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:39,020
Sorry, LA, I'm gonna have to email them and sort this out if it doesn't automatically like come back and say you Can I find whether I'm a member or not?

710
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:49,160
I cannot help you with this problem, but I mean I suggest you just search your emails for an email that is titled um

711
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:53,079
LACON 5 registration confirmation.

712
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,800
And if you have it, then you registered.

713
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:03,320
But if you didn't so if you voted through site selection, and this is actually a a rant I was gonna have later

714
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,940
to show that we don't just um criticize Montreal.

715
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,420
We criticise all worldcons.

716
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,940
We do criticize all world cons.

717
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:17,620
LA Con does not have a membership list on their website and there is no way to check your membership status without writing to them and asking.

718
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:24,200
So I wrote to them and asked, uh, I still don't know my membership number, so I have to reply and ask, yes, but what is my actual membership number?

719
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:26,680
Because it's not linked on Planarama and I want to put it in.

720
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:34,859
So I wrote in, I am a supporting member, but I've never had an email from LA to confirm that or tell me that or anything.

721
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,200
Uh I have you checked your spam?

722
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,880
I I nearly said butthole there, but I said spam because I got an email

723
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:49,620
No, but I got an email on the sixth of September twenty twenty four saying that I was a Worcester member because I had voted in site selection.

724
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,260
Twenty twenty four, yeah, no, two days after the WorldCon.

725
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:52,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

726
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:53,540
You can't.

727
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,020
Did you s

728
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,140
But so so I did get an email, but yours might have gone gone astray for some reason.

729
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:06,100
But I do I do ha I searched using the search string Liz has just given me and I did find my registration confirmation.

730
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,260
So I am a Wusf member.

731
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,860
No, I do not I do not have that email.

732
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:16,380
I do sporadically check I do relatively often check my spam, but

733
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,940
But it's just frustrating, right?

734
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:28,900
Because if there's one email, it could go in someone's spam, and there should be resources on the website where you can look up what the list of members is and you can look up whether or not you are one

735
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,380
Like why is there no login portal?

736
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,300
Or at least look up your own membership.

737
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,859
I'm sure Seattle had a login portal at this stage.

738
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,300
And when it says

739
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,460
Upgrades from Wusfus only, which I am and I now want to upgrade to virtual.

740
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:48,300
The website says contact us, which is as a as a kind of proper nerd, that that is not what I want to see on a website.

741
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:57,640
So I think LACON's registration approach is quite poor if you have already voted in site selection.

742
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,560
It may be quite good if you haven't.

743
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,440
But this is distracting from Renee and Molly's excellent resources.

744
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,039
So thank you very much to both.

745
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,559
Um I think these are great.

746
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,760
It's it's really good to have

747
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:16,819
multiple ways of explaining things simply because th if y you don't always resonate with one person's explanation to having multiple

748
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,420
persons explain is really really good.

749
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,539
So hurrah!

750
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:27,859
And if you're listening to this listeners, you can be a voter in the Hugo Awards and we recommend it.

751
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:35,880
Um, so given it is Hugo registration season, which will probably shortly be followed by

752
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,740
Hugo nomination season.

753
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,260
Um I thought I would highlight a couple of things.

754
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:47,660
One is to highlight Renee's uh Intergalactic mixtape uh I I like to call it a fanzine.

755
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,220
I think it is, strictly speaking, a

756
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,540
Mailing list.

757
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,260
Mailing lists are a subset of fanzines.

758
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,700
Yeah, I think so.

759
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:03,700
Um But Renee does basically link to a ton of stuff, including a lot of book reviews, a lot of recommendations, essays.

760
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:08,220
And, you know, given the time of year is there a lot of like end of year roundups.

761
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,420
So I think it's a good time to be going looking at

762
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,600
what has been recommended by people and then you might say, Oh, that sounds really good.

763
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,520
I've got time to read it before Hugo nominations open.

764
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And separately I was going to highlight uh a similar essay that Kat Corbetty wrote on their website.

765
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:34,920
Because I think they've highlighted some stuff that people might not think about and think is actually eligible but they're really interesting.

766
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,440
So for intro instance they've nominated um

767
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:46,720
An album, a science fiction concept album from a Dutch prog rock artist called Arjen Lucasen

768
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,340
um which I might go and listen to.

769
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:55,620
Uh they've nominated a lot of the sort of nice YouTube commentary and essays that I quite like to watch on various science fictional topics

770
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:06,119
Um but the one I'm gonna really pull out because I've also read it and agree it's great, is a very long essay by Elizabeth Sanderfer called The Cuddled Little Vice.

771
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:14,960
which is all about basically it's the Neil Gaiman it it basically puts Neil Gaiman's whole career in context

772
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:26,360
Um, mostly focusing on a lot of his early comics work and but it's a really good kind of overview of of his work at a time when we are kind of reconsidering

773
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,120
what we know about him and the legacy is left to fandom.

774
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:37,480
Um and so I really, really recommend it and I think it is definitely going to get one of my spots for best related work.

775
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,779
And I think that's the one thing I would recommend everyone goes and has a read through if you feel like you can.

776
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,299
Have either of you guys read it?

777
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,420
Apparently it's sixty one thousand words, which I didn't realise

778
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,200
when I was reading it as a blog post, it doesn't feel nearly that long, but it is a very substantial piece of work.

779
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,720
I've not read it yet.

780
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,640
Um and that's exactly why I'm mentioning it in January.

781
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,240
I should have made it a pick really.

782
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,799
I I I feel like I do want to w

783
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,480
To read the whole of Last War in Albion, not merely this chapter of it.

784
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,240
In that case, just start with the first one, right?

785
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:10,960
Yeah.

786
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,320
This is book four?

787
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,040
Oh god.

788
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:13,920
Hmm.

789
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:14,400
No.

790
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,060
What?

791
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,620
No.

792
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:23,020
The m Gaiman the Gaiman one is book two, isn't it?

793
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,780
It is chapter three of

794
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,280
Book four?

795
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,320
Oh, okay.

796
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,040
Interesting.

797
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,720
I might have gone a bit confused.

798
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,800
So is the whole book serialized on her website or can you buy it as an actual book?

799
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:38,099
I think it's serialized, but you may be able to buy them.

800
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,460
Cause that's the problem.

801
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:45,380
I'm not gonna sit and read a website for like an hour, but if it's on my uh ebooks, I might well.

802
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,820
So like, yeah.

803
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:53,440
Might might need to dig around and see if there's like a proper book copy, whether that's E or otherwise.

804
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,960
I mean not all the not all the things are sixty-one thousand words.

805
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:02,420
The Last War in Albion is a history of British comics and she started it in twenty thirteen.

806
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:11,299
This is a thing like I'm like how figure one the great bearded wizard of Northampton, how can I not have previously been aw aware of this?

807
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,140
Cause you're not omniscient.

808
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,140
As it turns out, none of us are.

809
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,620
There's just too much stuff to know everything.

810
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,900
I how did that happen?

811
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,340
When did that happen?

812
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:24,260
I th I think the failure here is that I have never mentioned it to you.

813
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,460
You might have.

814
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,020
I will say that when I go on her when I go on that thing

815
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,360
The little thing at the top says Last War in Albion Book 2.

816
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:40,400
So I'm very confused that it's chapter 3 or Book 4 because Oh, it's the new epilogue to book 2.

817
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:40,700
Okay.

818
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:47,180
So it is so I could so you've only got to read two books to get to this epilogue, Alison, if you do it in order.

819
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:55,020
I might just read this article because But if the epilogue is sixty one thousand words, that does rather raise the question of how long the books are.

820
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,859
So you could buy the first book as an ebook.

821
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:01,900
I've certainly found it on Amazon, it's probably in other places, and it's about it's 788 words.

822
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,859
So it's hefty.

823
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:04,380
Seven seven hundred and eighty-eight words.

824
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:05,980
Sorry, seven and eighty-eight pages.

825
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:06,460
Ah!

826
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,180
Okay

827
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,440
Yes, but it's probably got some pictures in it.

828
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Well anyway, yes, thank you very much for directing our uh um attention to this, uh Liz and Kat, because

829
00:56:16,059 --> 00:56:16,619
Hurrah!

830
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,059
This sounds great.

831
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,420
It's not expensive.

832
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:23,740
It's free with Kobo Plus, which I had a for a while by accident, but I've cancelled now.

833
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:25,260
So I might take it again.

834
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:33,420
I can't remember whether Sandafer's uh previous book, um, about the alt right and so on, was on the Hugo shortlist.

835
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,180
It may have been in the nominations

836
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah, I I'm so much more interested in the history of the British comics than I am in the alt right.

837
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,599
I'm sorry, I know that's No, that I mean, I think that's fair, but yeah.

838
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,440
It was kind of the alt-right as it.

839
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,280
Connects with fandom in some ways as well.

840
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,560
Yeah, I think I'm interested in how things got where they are, but

841
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,740
So book one or volume one is on is available as an ebook.

842
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:04,020
Doesn't look like volume two is yet, um, but Kobo tells you the actual word count.

843
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:07,060
So volume one is two hundred and thirty-three thousand words.

844
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,440
I'll put a link in the show notes.

845
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,520
Yeah, I think it's just when they are complete and collected.

846
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,560
Nice.

847
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,400
I love the cover.

848
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,980
Handsome Grant Morrison versus Alan the Gentleman Moore.

849
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,740
I met Alan Moore in nineteen eighty-five.

850
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,140
Alan Moore came to talk to Custavus in nineteen eighty-five, j which was just bef

851
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:34,160
while Watchman was being written but before any of it had been released and everyone was extremely excited about it.

852
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,880
That that night had a great impact uh had a profound effect on me.

853
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,400
Touched by the presence of extremely stoned genius.

854
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:52,799
Um, 'cause we all went back to somebody's college room for a party where he was showing round pictures from you know, r uh early, early art from Watchmen.

855
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,319
That was fabulous.

856
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:54,900
Oh nice.

857
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,820
Take take opportunities, guys.

858
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,780
When you get chances to do interesting things, do them

859
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,000
Shall we go to Picks?

860
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,279
Uh go quick.

861
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,240
My pick is K-pop Demon Hunters, which I I had been vaguely aware of

862
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,800
Because I am vaguely aware of memes, but um Netflix says you might like K pop Demon Hunters over Christmas.

863
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:33,859
through memes in multiple locations, including ukulele forums and trivia quizzes, before I got round to watching it.

864
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,140
It is a film about a girl band who also

865
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,780
Fight Demons.

866
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,620
Um, it's an animated film.

867
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:45,980
It is not Korean, it is American, but it um essentially channels a lot of Korean

868
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:51,380
Culture it's entirely made by Koreans and Korean Americans and I really enjoyed it quite a lot.

869
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,500
And there's a sing-along version because it's actually a musical.

870
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,300
Um

871
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,660
And yeah.

872
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,579
It's it was a lot of fun.

873
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,619
I I think I'm going to suggest it for your Hugo consideration.

874
00:59:02,859 --> 00:59:06,940
Um, but it's obviously not maybe the deepest movie in the world, but it will

875
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,600
Mm take away all of your cares for about one hour and forty minutes and what more do you want from life?

876
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,920
K-pop demon hunters, I submit.

877
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,520
I liked it.

878
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,940
Yeah, I've watched that.

879
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,820
It's fun.

880
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,580
But you enjoyed watching it, right?

881
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,020
You're glad you saw it and it was fun.

882
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,820
And also I'm now down with the kids because, you know

883
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,320
Children know what this movie is.

884
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:32,120
Well, and also you'll probably have seen one of the best dramatic presentation long form finalists when the Hugo Awards dropped.

885
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,360
I did say, for your Hugo consideration

886
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,760
But I would be surprised if this wasn't on it, 'cause it has achieved cultural penetration.

887
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:48,079
But we had some people in uh K-pop Demon Hunters costumes uh trick or treating, so Yes, I now understand a lot of

888
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:56,180
photos I saw on my feeds around Halloween because Netflix nobody thought they would need to make a billion

889
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:03,039
K-pop demon hunter costumes and put them on the market as a result of which there were none to be had and there was a lot of creative costuming going on.

890
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,200
Liz, do you want to do your pick?

891
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:11,780
Yes, my pick is going to be an exhibition, just because you guys are always picking exhibitions and I never do it.

892
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:19,460
Um and so I went to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich with some chums who may be listening to this podcast.

893
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:19,940
Hello.

894
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:33,660
Uh and we went to see the Astronomy Photographer of the Year exhibition, which does feel very much like someone saw that the National History Museum make a lot of money from Wildlife Photographer the Year exhibits and thought they would have a space one.

895
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,180
Um but on the other hand

896
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,660
And space is very cool.

897
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,100
So it's very similar to that.

898
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,300
There's different categories of photo.

899
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:45,380
There's one for auroras, one for like galaxies and nebula and the sun and the moon.

900
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:50,100
And it's just like the best photographs taken of those objects.

901
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,240
I think in the last year.

902
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,599
I think this one might have been in twenty twenty four, twenty twenty five, possibly.

903
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,839
And they're all nicely laid out.

904
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:02,440
What I did find is that a lot of because a lot of like astronomy photos are

905
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,339
generally kind of composites of different time lapses and different length exposures.

906
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:13,260
So it feels a little bit more like these are all kind of things people have put together and need a high level of skill.

907
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:17,420
Whereas if you look at like wildlife photography year, even if I couldn't take those photos

908
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,900
I do at least get that feeling of, oh yeah, that's great.

909
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,339
You just have to be in the right place to catch the llama or whatever.

910
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:27,619
But some of these are like, you know, some of these photos were taken with like

911
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:33,600
the deep space observation telescope in Chile and things like that, which are a little more distant.

912
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,720
I know I could not actually take the Wildlife Photographer of the Year photos, but at least I have

913
01:01:38,859 --> 01:01:47,180
feasibly taken photos of wildlife in a way I have not feasibly taken photos of the M thirty nebula in the hydrogen spectrum or whatever.

914
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,560
But I did enjoy it still as well.

915
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:56,120
I think what I would actually love to see is a bit more about how people do do the process of compositing and so on.

916
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,480
One of the best bits was they had a big video where you could

917
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:07,319
Uh they did interviews with a couple of the winning photographers and they talked a bit more about how they took the photo and and what they did and that was pretty cool.

918
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:18,460
And there's also like an open category which uh you can use any data, so it's a lot of like repurposing and reprocessing and imaging of like data from like space telescopes and stuff, which was quite cool.

919
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,340
Anyway, it was fun.

920
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:23,660
It's in the National Maritime Museum, which is uh pretty good as well.

921
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:28,780
It's a nice fun day out, and you can go and see some photos of space

922
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:30,599
Space.

923
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:40,599
There's a I mean this won't surprise John, I'm sure, but obviously astronomy photos there's a bunch of kind of recolouring and reprocessing and filtration.

924
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,520
There's a bit of Photoshop and

925
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:52,660
uh you know, it's i there's a ton of stuff going on here and in fact there is a page on their website saying how the winning image was created and there's a lot of different stuff going on there.

926
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,339
So and it does explain it all.

927
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,500
So at just at the point where you were saying I wish I

928
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,440
There would be more about how it was done.

929
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:04,280
I was reading or looking at an article about how it was done, which I will I can put in the show notes.

930
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,560
Uh alright.

931
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,800
I'm gonna pick um uh Blast from the Past.

932
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:14,220
Uh I'm gonna pick the Umbrella Academy, which you can watch on Netflix.

933
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:15,900
Have you finished it now?

934
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,900
I've seen the first two seasons.

935
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:18,700
It's good.

936
01:03:18,859 --> 01:03:24,140
I was a little bit skeptical of season two, but I think it does keep being good.

937
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,820
Uh yeah, we just finished season two and it was it was very enjoyable.

938
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,660
We're taking a short break before we dive into season three to watch Pluribus.

939
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:38,000
I have watched the first episode of Plurverse, and I will say that I have the same problem with it as I did with the Planet of the Apes remake.

940
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,840
And what is that problem, John?

941
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:47,819
People working on these things would have better understanding of how quarantine works than it is exhibited in those works of art.

942
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:53,740
I have suspended my disbelief, but there's no way any of the things in the first fifteen minutes of Pluribus would ever have happened.

943
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,859
But once I got past that, it seems to be cracking.

944
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:00,540
Fur first episode of Pluribus is very much not like the whole of the rest of the show.

945
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,020
I'm looking forward to experiencing the rest of the show.

946
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,260
And that was the Octothorpe podcast.

947
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:06,540
And it's goodbye from me.

948
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,820
It's goodbye from me.

949
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,579
And it's goodbye from me.

950
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,200
I would like to make a personal appeal to Ed Morland.

951
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,520
Ed, please write us more letters about Cyclocross than I can annoy John and Allison.

952
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,760
Ooh, and we can talk about Flam Rouge.

953
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:45,180
I I like Flam Rouge a lot, but my family it's one of these games where one of my family doesn't like it and so we don't it doesn't get played.

954
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,020
Johnson's like, why not just play Heat?

955
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,260
And I'm like, well A, we don't own Heat

956
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,560
And B, they're not the same game.

957
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,520
They're not the same game.

958
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:57,680
I will say I think I am on Jonathan's side that he is probably my preference of the two, but they are both cracking.

959
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,480
I mean Cyclocross isn't the same as like

960
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,240
The Tour de France stuff, is it?

961
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,920
I don't know what Cyclocross is.

962
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,960
What's cyclocross?

963
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,680
Is it like mm marathons but for cycling?

964
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,079
No.

965
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,359
Is it like steeplechase but for cycling?

966
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,580
Is it the one where you go round around in a circle?

967
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:17,580
I don't really know what you mean by steeple ch you mean running steeple chase.

968
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:19,580
Obstac I mean like obstacles.

969
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:24,120
I don't really want to talk more about Cyclocross because I don't even watch very much Cyclocross.

970
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,160
I just was having a little anti-cricket moment.

971
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,240
Shall we go on with the pod and do another letter?

972
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,680
We can do it if you like.

973
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:36,220
The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin McLeod and Compatech.
