1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Can I suggest that this is extremely tedious podcast content and we should move on?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,700
 You should clip that bit. Yeah, and just put it in a sound deck and then you can use it every single fortnight

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,960
 Even though I have eaten apparently I can still be angry

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,440
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,680
 127th episode of Octothorpe a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,040
 Which is coming to you on the 30th of January 2025. I'm John Coxon

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,080
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,640
 We have some letters of comment

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,160
 So we got a couple of comments on blue sky one from Abigail Nussbaum

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,280
 Who also wrote the letter which we will get back to you later and Abigail reckons that she and John are not easily mistaken for another

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,480
 So John any comment. I don't remember saying this so I'm deeply confused. I think I said it

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,960
 It was a joke about how I'm confusing Abigail for me. You see

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,200
 Your test audience of two says hmm

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:26,120
 We also heard from Edmoreland as part of a blue sky thread in which they're talking about how it's nice to see a war

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,240
 season

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,320
 Going from like a very broad range of stuff and you know people slowly narrowing it down to the set of nominations

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,000
 And yeah, I think that is a nice conversation. It's like to be in that conversation. I also

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,600
 Love the process by which

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,560
 Everything that happened last year and it starts to turn into well here are some frontrunners that we're thinking about in lots of different spaces

20
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,440
 So people's frontrunners very quite a lot as well and Edmoreland also wrote what's on Facebook Liz a double threat

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,840
 We should say that we said we were getting our hugo chat out of the way early because we want to have it all done before

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,780
 nominations open but

23
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,320
 nominations are not yet open so we're gonna carry on but obviously these are not my recommendations anyway

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,880
 These are recommendations from our listeners who probably in many cases read quite a lot more than we have watched quite a lot more than we have so

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,160
 All good recommendations. They're all good recommendations Brent Ed pulls out the West Passeritz by Jared Pesser check

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,360
 Which I've also heard good things about but I believe is not out in the UK yet

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,960
 So you'd have to get an input coffee and also private rights by Julia

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,560
 Enfield which I meant to mention and was one of those things where I forgot to mention it last

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,200
 episode

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,720
 Rosanna Pendlebury also pointed out that that was a good one that we didn't mention and there's a bit of a discussion of that on Facebook

31
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,520
 But basically I also really like that and just forgot about it. It's basically the story of three sisters and

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,820
 their relationship with their father

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,280
 After he dies, but the backdrop is all basically

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,680
 England that is falling apart due to climate change slowly and it's really kind of all about sort of the the

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,840
 psychological effects of living with a world that is slowly disintegrating around you

36
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
 Oh, it's very interesting and I was it's quite different to anything else we mentioned last

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,480
 Episode so if you like that sort of thing you probably gonna give that a go

38
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,880
 It also mentions best game category really enjoyed tactical breach wizards which I saw trailer of and looks amazingly fun

39
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,480
 But his window is only so yeah, no, I

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,760
 Tactical breach ritzes is a game

41
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,280
 I would have certainly put bought and played were it available on Mac and

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,600
 When I spoke the last time about a lot of games being very trivial to play on Mac using whiskey

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,120
 Which is a port of open source front-end to apples?

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,920
 Open gaming thing that doesn't really apply to anything. That's got like graphics in it. It's great for you kind of little

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,360
 Little games that are kind of retro as 80 games and things like that

46
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,760
 But but games that actually have a lot of stuff probably won't work that way. Tell me if I'm wrong

47
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,080
 I can't remember if I kept that bit in

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:06,280
 This is the sort game that I would play the absolute shit out of if it was on switch

49
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,400
 Hmm, it does it like a perfect a perfect thing that should be ported to switch assuming that the controls would not be completely

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,120
 Impossible to to do I want to have it in my pocket

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,800
 Well, I'm a switch doesn't fit my pockets, but you know, I know I could technically

52
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,640
 Buy a PC use steam link to play it on my Apple TV with a controller

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,000
 But like and I could get steamed egg

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,120
 I don't really want a steamed egg

55
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,400
 I mean a steamed egg seems more likely for that kind of thing

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,600
 But basically I have succumbed to multiple consoles in the past year, so I'm not getting anymore

57
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,360
 Not right now. We also heard as I mentioned from Rosanna Pendlebury who recommends the West Passage and private rights as well

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,720
 But also 381 by Alia Whiteley

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,040
 Metal from Heaven by August Clark and in universes by Emmet North and I have at least one of those sitting on my Kindle waiting to be read

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,040
 So I might get through it in time, but probably not in time to give you opinions on it next week

61
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,360
 So I have read some of these

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,640
 381 I

63
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,360
 thought was

64
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,000
 quite poor, but I

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,280
 also

66
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,880
 Thought Skywood in by the same author was quite poor and it might just be that I don't gel with that author

67
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,360
 Both books

68
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,520
 I thought had very interesting ideas that I was keen to see where they went and then they went to the square root of nowhere

69
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
 And I was a bit peeved that I had

70
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,560
 Mmm, I I I would like more coherent books, which is a very me statement

71
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,360
 however in universes is the next one on my list and I am absolutely fascinated by it and

72
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,880
 I've heard really good things about private rights, which I am

73
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,000
 Intrigued at some point to read. I don't know if you like it

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,280
 But I think it's absolutely the sort of thing that feels like the clock should be thinking about because I don't think it's gonna get nominated

75
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,280
 Anything else because it's a small

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,200
 Second a second book by a like a small British author, but it's also the sort of thing. I think a lot of clutches might like

77
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,720
 Anyway, can't be any of that and podcast me if I may be permitted on a tiny tangent, which I'm gonna cause it's my podcast too

78
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:19,440
 There is some discussion in the comments between me and Rosanna about what constitutes like science fiction and what is kind of

79
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,080
 Climate fiction and and so there is some discussion of that and what I'm thinking is also

80
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,720
 Between reading that and the Ministry of Time quite quickly back to back where the Ministry of Time like climate change is just

81
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,480
 It's a background thing that people talk about heat waves and extreme weather events like

82
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,880
 If I write a book set two or three years from now where they happen to just be extreme weather events

83
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,800
 Is that science fiction now or is that just sort of realistic?

84
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,960
 Strapolation and what's the difference?

85
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:52,080
 Right, exactly and if we were a serious science fiction podcast, we might discuss that but actually I think we're gonna go on

86
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,680
 Just make more jokes. Someone else wants to do a letter

87
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:02,280
 I want to do one very quickly which is that Fara said please put in a shout in nominations for the eight days of Diana

88
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
 Win Jones, which is a podcast

89
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,640
 about the first nine of Diana's books by Emily Tesh and Rebecca

90
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,440
 Fremo and this had not crossed my radar at all and I'm like oh no, I'm gonna listen to this next week

91
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,620
 So Fara says it's very good Diana's stuff's very good. So podcasts about it good Emily Tesh is very good

92
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,220
 What's not to like haven't actually listened to it yet? I will let you know. I've also had good stuff about Rebecca Fremo's

93
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,400
 Novel which let me just get the title up

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,680
 So so thank you for that recommendation Fara. That's a great shout

95
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:44,600
 Yes, Lady Eve Laskon is Rebecca Fremo's book which I have heard good things about it is basically

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,080
 It says it is describing a good read as a suffix space sci-fi

97
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,580
 It sounds kind of fun and it really doesn't narrow it down these days doesn't know but it sounds a bit like what I wanted

98
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,320
 That Mary Robinette Cowell novel to be that was like

99
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,200
 Murder mystery on a on a interstellar space cruise line

100
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,880
 This sounds like what I wanted that to be except more lesbian. So yeah, I should probably pick that up

101
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,840
 Then you can take one for the team fun light-hearted saffron mants. Hey, it's your 99

102
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,280
 Yep, I will take that one for the team Johnny Badley says is Keanu Reeves eligible for the astounding award for best new writer

103
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,760
 Yes, if you think he is the best new writer if you do not do not nominate him one of the six

104
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,160
 What are the five best new writers? What you mean?

105
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,520
 I'm not allowed to nominate him just because I think it's hilarious

106
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,720
 I mean that I'm worried right because to an actual debut author

107
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,320
 It could mean a lot to be nominated for the sounded

108
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,880
 The sounding and I am a bit worried that Keanu Reeves name will be there for the memes and then I'm a bit worried

109
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,640
 He might win. I really hope that we don't give Keanu Reeves the sounding award because sure he's lovely

110
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,240
 But I'm not really sure that's for the good of the genre or so

111
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,760
 I didn't like the book of elsewhere

112
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,360
 I thought it was deeply misogynistic and unpleasant

113
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,920
 So there is also that listeners has he actually written any

114
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,760
 SF on his own or is it just in collaboration with China Mayville?

115
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,840
 He's done some comics and stuff before I'd actually reasonably say he so it's okay for the to the wuss was

116
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,280
 Constitution is it okay to be a lobulated for the astounding award if

117
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,000
 If you've written your booking collaboration with a long established award-winning lovelist

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,840
 It's genuinely good question. I think I think so this I can mention

119
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,800
 Someone who is eligible for the astounding and I haven't read their book

120
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
 So it's a bit cheeky

121
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,800
 But Michael Green was great on a panel at Wilcom to the point where I put their book on my like, you know

122
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,600
 List of books to be bought and read at some point

123
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
 So I cannot vouch for the book

124
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
 But if it's as good as they were in the panel, it'll be good. So give that a give that a go

125
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,280
 There's probably people currently shouting at their radios. I'm assuming everyone listens on radio when we

126
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,520
 broadcast on the FM saying John you fool

127
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,160
 Don't you know that the astounding eligibility isn't in the Constitution and listeners I had forgotten so

128
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,600
 I've stopped looking and someone can look it up and write in it's up to a standing is it I assume so also

129
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,480
 It's still referred to as the John W Campbell award in at least one place in the Constitution

130
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,080
 So that probably ought to be changed go

131
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,400
 Where's the nit-spick nit picking of fly-spicking

132
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,400
 Exactly right come on guys all right nitpicking I

133
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,560
 Cannot find it in the most recent version. So are you definitely on the most recent version? I'm on the

134
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,760
 One as of August 12 if I type Campbell it appears in section 3.0. It does final award ballots

135
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,100
 She'll listen to the Google was the John W Campbell award for best new writer and the low star award best young adult book

136
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:04,280
 So Glasgow was in contravention of the Constitution because they didn't call it the John W Campbell award on the ballot

137
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,840
 This is why this is why going back to last time

138
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,640
 I'm not too bothered when call when

139
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,640
 Conventions ignore stupid parts of the wuss was called sution because if you rigidly obey the whole thing it doesn't make any sense

140
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,400
 Then we also heard from

141
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,280
 Ally Baker Brooks who says that she is gonna go through her reading for last year for load star recommendations

142
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,040
 Thank you very much to Ali. We also heard on Facebook from Neil

143
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,600
 Ottenstein who says I haven't even considered Wallace and Gromit even though it was magnificent

144
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:45,080
 Since it is only 79 minutes long. I believe we'll go on to short form instead of long form and we also got a letter

145
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:52,720
 We also heard from David in Salter who commends the French animated feature Mars Express to us as worthy of nomination for a

146
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,600
 Hugo and

147
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 Thing is that both of these actually have run times under 90 minutes and so therefore they could go into best dramatic presentation

148
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,120
 Short form however, it feels weird in spirit to do that because they both feel like films and so should go in long

149
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,360
 form with other films and

150
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:18,360
 There is precedent for this in that according to the wuss was constitution, which obviously I have open you know for

151
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,320
 Checking at all times

152
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,880
 It does say that you can basically move things between categories if they are within 20% of the

153
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,000
 length boundary

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,240
 So basically if it was like a duck and it quite like a duck and it is within 20% of the length of a duck

155
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,480
 You can put it in the category of ducks and the present here is Wallace and Gromit curse of the were Abbott

156
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:48,360
 Which was in best romantic presentation long form in 2006 although there are no details in the detailed notes to say

157
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,520
 Whether it just says qualifies for both long form and short form voters placed it in the long form category

158
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
 So I assume it was only nominated there

159
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,000
 Interestingly that was the year when we had nominated Dr

160
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,800
 To the empty child and the doctor dances to parta, which is says qualifies as both long form and short form and voters place it in the short form category

161
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:12,560
 So I think that means we had a something in short form which was longer in runtime than something in long form

162
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,560
 Which is very confusing anyway, why wasn't Gromit curse of the were Abbott did not win

163
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,540
 Which is obviously a travesty even though there were other good stuff there

164
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,400
 Yeah, but still in hindsight

165
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,240
 Curse of where rabbit and ventures most foul is very good if you haven't had a chance to see it then

166
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,660
 Do try and have a look at it before you nominate am I allowed to go and find my

167
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,840
 Friends review of curse of the were Abbott, which is the best review ever

168
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,520
 Yeah, it's also worth knowing so David asks in his email like when putting these things in the big Hugo spreadsheet of doom

169
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,480
 Which tab do you put them in like cuz technically they're in one but you might think they should be in another

170
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,280
 My impression is in general the administrators will move votes to the

171
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,400
 Category that voters put the most votes in so if everyone nominates it in long form except for like three votes

172
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,400
 Those votes will be moved, but if the reverse happens they'd be moved the other way

173
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,560
 Like in general Hugo administrators try and respect the will of the voters

174
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,760
 So if you think you know it depends what you want to encourage your fellow nominators to do

175
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,360
 But if you think it quacks like a duck I would put it in the duck tab

176
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,600
 Would be my recommendation that that would be my strong recommendation when nominating is is nominate ducks

177
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,360
 In there, but each sort of poultry should go into its individual poultry category

178
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,680
 So David mentions Mars Express original release in France in 2023, but North American release in 2024

179
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,440
 which

180
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,400
 Makes it eligible for the Hugo's in Seattle

181
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,800
 But if you are a British listener of which I believe we have some it is coming to the UK in May 2025

182
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,600
 So if it ends up on the ballot, it will hopefully be in cinemas just in time for you to make an informed decision

183
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,720
 Yeah, I think I totally missed this. I'm not sure ever got a release here

184
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,880
 David does say it's a cyberpunk noir detective story that feels a bit like if Mobius a directed Blade Runner

185
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,720
 And that is ahead of a logline. So yeah, I am interested in the movie from

186
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,920
 The email that you've sent David. So I will be keeping an eye out for it for sure

187
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,640
 Yeah, no, I'm gonna watch this when it gets this UK cinema release in May apparently

188
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,640
 So I will look out for it and go and see it at the flicks David did also write

189
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,240
 Having said all that I will now express an opinion which will probably make you discount everything that's come before at the rambling of a man

190
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:40,280
 Who has clearly no taste and is possibly out of his mind the substance is a no good awful bad highly overrated film

191
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,840
 It's over long by more than a bit repetitive pretentious and insufferably didactic

192
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,480
 And I should know as I've been accused of being all of those things at one point or another

193
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,880
 It doesn't succeed as sf it doesn't succeed as horror and it doesn't succeed as social commentary

194
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,640
 I'd say it also doesn't succeed as comedy only a did chuckle a couple of times

195
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,280
 But they were half-hearted chuckles at best

196
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,920
 It assumes its audience consists solely of simpletons who have no hope of understanding even both basic of thematical plot points

197
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,760
 Unless we're bludgeoned over the head would said thematical plot points again and again and again

198
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:14,000
 Until we put our collective hand up to bock the next blow whimpering we collectively get it now. Will you please stop?

199
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,800
 Also today

200
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,080
 I found out the surest path to mega stardom in 21st century Hollywood is hosting a Jane Fonda style workout show from the 80s

201
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:30,320
 Who knew and then he and then he concludes the email by the way love the podcast except for the bits where you repeatedly praised the substance

202
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,800
 Now I I did quite like the substance, but I did

203
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,600
 I mean I can I can see this reading of the substance and yes, it was very well put and it made us trough at all

204
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 So thank you very much David

205
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,960
 I I see where you're coming from but the thing that I think it succeeds that is satire

206
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,520
 Which is not any of the things you mentioned but is something I really like in movies and do not get enough of

207
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,320
 And I think it's quite a good satire and there we go

208
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,920
 I do take the point about the fitness show though. Yeah, no, that's completely right

209
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:11,440
 You're dead all there hadn't occurred to me at all and then you mentioned it and I oh yeah, that doesn't it's there for the body for the stuff about

210
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,000
 Body obsession. It makes sense in the context of the movie and for the satire, but yes, no

211
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,160
 It's it's a cheap target wait. What's the thing about the submarine arrays of the last arc?

212
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,840
 Erwin Hirsch wrote in with a small clarification for us

213
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:32,760
 He says hi octa thought casters that is already a naph. It's the national and Dora fan fun

214
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,880
 And then he sent a quick clarification saying no Australia not and Dora and then sent a link

215
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,000
 Thank you very much to Owen for it again

216
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,220
 I was I was saying I was like I'm sure there's already a naph and I was like I can't think what it would be

217
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,200
 But yes the national Australian fan fund which is another example of the national fan funds

218
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,920
 We were talking about in reference to cuff so thank you very much for reminding me

219
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,920
 Oh, when and a great choice for a national fan phone because as I know now Australia is quite big

220
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,120
 You may think it's a long way down the shops to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to Australia listen that we also

221
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,800
 Got a letter from Amigail Nussbaum who thanks us for mentioning her book track changes as being on our prospective

222
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,240
 Hugo ballots because it very much is and concurring with our praise for Briar Dean books a

223
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,240
 Micropress which produces books of long-form SF criticism

224
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,960
 You may know them from I was mentioning their books many many times

225
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:35,680
 Briar Dean books this week opened pre-orders for their next book which is color fields writing about writing about science fiction by Paul

226
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,920
 Kincaid and I know there have been collections of Paul Kincaid critical works before but this is his collection of critical works

227
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:51,320
 Writing about critical works about science fiction. So he's looking at different histories works and biographies and studies of the field of science fiction

228
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
 Oh, this is inception, isn't it?

229
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,320
 This is getting quite meta. Yes, because if we have enough of these books that are writing about writing about science fiction

230
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,680
 We can have writing about writing about writing about science fiction, but it's got a really lovely cover

231
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,040
 So it does who did the cover?

232
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,840
 Tom joys

233
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,400
 And I do very much like how all the Briar Dean books are you know

234
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,800
 They have distinctive and original colors, but they all feel like they fit a theme

235
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,800
 They're gonna look all very nice on my shelf and I'm not really a collecting books because they look nice on the shelf person

236
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,360
 Abia also has an interesting thought about again the best romantic presentation short and long form categories

237
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,880
 Which she says reflects a trend of treating those categories as respectively best TV show and best movie

238
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,000
 Which does have the effect that sometimes for best short form?

239
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,880
 It's not always the single best episode of something but becomes one which is more representative of the show people like as a whole

240
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,040
 Which is interesting?

241
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:52,320
 And she's come around to the practice of nominating whole seasons of TV in the long form category

242
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,560
 And so she has some recommendations in the long form category

243
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,200
 recommends the anime delicious in dungeon and

244
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,520
 The only season of chaos the Netflix show a few watch down to those. No, I picked chaos. I think oh, yeah

245
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,400
 It wasn't me. Yes. Well, yes neither of you have watched it's likely on the one who picked it

246
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,080
 I thought it was very good. We were we were quite sad to hear it to be cancelled because we enjoyed the first series

247
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,520
 I would definitely go to watch the second. Yeah, the other problem

248
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,040
 It's had is that now I know it only has one series. I'm like oh, I'll get around to it at some point

249
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,520
 Rather than being like these ask about the next one

250
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,000
 Well, you'll you'll get round to it if it's nominated which it won't be it might be here

251
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,920
 It was nominated. I might know watch all 13 of them before the things and it's 13

252
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,400
 It's probably 10 or 8 or some weird number of the Netflix I

253
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:46,120
 Feel like it's eight don't quote me Abigail also lists some short form TV episodes

254
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,080
 She will be putting into short form which include Doctor Who's dot and bubble

255
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,580
 Which I did really like actually and then four things I haven't watched namely Star Trek discos

256
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,560
 Whistle speak their body detectives the case is a very long stairway future armour quids game and interview with the vampire

257
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,560
 Don't be afraid just start the tape. Yeah, I haven't watched any of them

258
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,720
 I'm so behind although to be fair I ground to a halt in Star Trek discovery part way through series four and stopped

259
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,440
 I'm here also says ps please update your blue scare can with the latest episodes

260
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,200
 So I can repost it and fair cop. I'm in charge of blue scare count

261
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:23,040
 Which means quite often I don't post in your episode for several days if you want to be notified the instant the episode comes out

262
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,800
 Please subscribe to our RSS feed. It is more reliable than my brain

263
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,080
 Yeah, if you subscribe to it in your favorite podcast listening program, then it'll just turn up

264
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,200
 It doesn't solve the problem of people very nicely wanting to me skaters, but it's also another problem

265
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,880
 We heard from Louise Hughes who says I stayed in Wolf himself for long-con 3

266
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,760
 it was a long way and the tube let me down several times and

267
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,480
 Yeah, that that sounds like it would have been quite the commute

268
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:59,120
 Yeah, the tube the tube doesn't actually go to excel. So normally it's DLR that lets you down especially in 2014

269
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,960
 It's slightly better now

270
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,240
 Raj also wrote in on master don

271
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,320
 Basically saying he's going to Belfast because he's an Ulster man and he will support the first not an Irish East Comfer enough

272
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,000
 And then he also mentioned he was surprised that we didn't mention Agatha all along which has been getting good reviews

273
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
 And he liked it and that is true

274
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,240
 It has been getting good reviews and Raj did like it

275
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,800
 Have you seen it either of you seen it not yet, but it has been I have heard good buzz

276
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,840
 So yeah, no people have told us told me it's great

277
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,680
 So it's gonna be Disney plus so Liz doesn't have Disney plus the thing with Disney plus is it makes

278
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,280
 Someone sent me to buy it a year at a time

279
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,640
 So I buy it watch the free year and then leave it lapsed until something comes along that I absolutely have to

280
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,160
 Resubscribe for and Agatha all along was not it and all season two will be it

281
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,280
 Oh, yeah, that's fine. They're gonna make one. Are they making one? Yes. Yeah, excellent

282
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,040
 And spending an enormous amount of money on it

283
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,280
 We got a letter from Andrew Openshaw who says I

284
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,400
 Love a 99 P Kindle recommendation. So thanks for the tainted cup

285
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,880
 I also love 99 P Kindle recommendations, but want to point out that they are also

286
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:17,040
 Generally, kobo recommendations or ebook recommendations in general. So there are other ebook stores apart from Amazon are available

287
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,200
 He suggests from bat Hague who we discussed like like I've read the humans

288
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,200
 Which is really funny and how to stop time plus the nonfiction books how to stay alive and notes on a nervous planet

289
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,440
 I actually saw him speak at Newcastle library a few years ago

290
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,280
 Where the two revealed that in the 90s he had a nervous breakdown in Newcastle's very own Eldon Square

291
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,680
 Which was the experience that set it on the path to become a novelist

292
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,200
 So this is kind of a warning to John really if you're ever anywhere near Eldon Square clearly a dangerous place

293
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,360
 Chris Garcia wrote in and he tells us that Bella is very excited with their first fan art

294
00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:00,800
 And yes, well done Bella and then he writes mother things and he says that there should be a US Mexican

295
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,040
 Fan Fund because there is good fandom in Mexico that US fandom rarely interacts with and yes

296
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,440
 That would be great. That should definitely happened and it could it could be called

297
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:17,160
 Muff the Mexico US fan fund and says that he has no 2024 reading to nominate

298
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:24,920
 But he would nominate as long form Tim Travers and the time travelers paradox and Deadpool Wolverine

299
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,080
 Thank you very much for bringing Chris

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,040
 Claire Briarley writes in having listened to our

301
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:36,880
 episode to a podcast for the first time in longer than she wants to admit and she writes

302
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,440
 To my amazement I found that you're still referencing my old letters of comment and we to Bix

303
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,520
 How did you know I was going to listen this time or are we in a time loop?

304
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,160
 I'd like to say that we stopped in the middle and talked about other things

305
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,000
 But that's not really true

306
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,800
 I very much enjoyed Liz's comment on the new naming channel of Wilcom's wuss was membership as it now relates to attendance at the wuss was business meeting

307
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:05,360
 Maybe they should form a committee to discuss that she also mentions the Australian naff and then she makes some recommendations

308
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,280
 one of which yes, she enjoyed reading the Mars house by Natasha pulley and

309
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,720
 She also mentions the novel. It's my pick for this episode

310
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,200
 So I will talk about it then and she recommends short fiction

311
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:27,320
 Why we why don't we just kill the kid in the Omeles hole by Isabelle J Kim and a catalog of 21st century ghosts by Pat Murphy

312
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:34,040
 She also thinks Sandra Bond's poems are well worth nominating and yes, she recommends time flies

313
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:41,000
 foolish foal and the planetary model or Rutherford was such a bore and between narnia and never where

314
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,360
 From Sandra's book. She says she also has her we to bits still has her we to bits no globe, which is good to know

315
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,760
 Yeah, I don't think we've talked about we to pick every episode

316
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,280
 I like to think that we said we to bits and basically this like sets off some alert

317
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:03,800
 Like it's like a you know quantum butterfly or something which leads to Claire listening to episode the we to bits symbol lights up over croydon

318
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,400
 Hmm. She does say that naff might have gone the way of cuff and it may no longer be extant

319
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,760
 Hard to tell with Australian funds. Yeah, I think that is

320
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,320
 Potentially an issue with poetry is that it is for a poem

321
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:24,680
 And if someone has published a long book full of poems, then there's a lot of potential there

322
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,080
 So it might behoove you to uh

323
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,120
 See if other people are putting things say on the big hugo spreadsheet so that you can coalesce around something

324
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,040
 Otherwise, you're just going to have like 20 poems

325
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,080
 None of which quite meets threshold. This is what this is why poems a bit of a daft hugo

326
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,600
 But there we go not for podcast. I think it's all right. It's this there's a one-off one. All right. That was like as a client

327
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,120
 Jesus Christ we've been recording for an hour and ten minutes

328
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,200
 Well, we haven't quite but oh, I'm gonna say I've only got 56 minutes

329
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:59,000
 So either time dilation is occurring between here and your castle. I looked at the zoom rather than my uh recording app

330
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,160
 But yeah, um

331
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,240
 So let's just go straight to pick and go to bed

332
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:10,600
 We should I think first list discuss the Belfast Easticon Belfast have sent out an email

333
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,480
 With the subject wants to be a program participant at reconnect

334
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,680
 And so if you want to be a program participant at reconnect

335
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:25,000
 You can visit a link in that email and then you can log in to plan z their program planning system

336
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,720
 And fill in your bio indicate you'd like to be on the program and such other things

337
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,400
 They say they're aiming to finalize their program in mid-February for release by the end of February

338
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,080
 So get your skates on listeners go do that

339
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:45,240
 Yeah, but I assume that is finished for people to say what they would like to be on not finished for putting out onto the internet

340
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,800
 And there's always some panels that needs to make sure people

341
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,840
 Indeed

342
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,440
 Maybe you can sign up and indicate your interest on being on octa thought the podcast

343
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,560
 I will do that. I'd love to see who else does that. I know it would be funny

344
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,040
 I know they probably won't have it open for sign up, but it would be funny program person mega mc.dodle writes

345
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,480
 Belfast is aiming to have three rooms streaming out with playback

346
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,280
 If community takes up interest either in volunteering or by online memberships, then

347
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,680
 They might try and go to five streams in but they're in the planning stage and looking at the art of the possible

348
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:25,160
 So that is their current plan and they're currently looking for volunteers to be involved with the online side of things

349
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,720
 So if you're interested in that do get in touch

350
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,760
 with the Belfast Easticon

351
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,040
 Email them and let them know that you might want to volunteer

352
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,800
 It's exciting that there will be streaming. I hope that means there will also be replay, but I don't know

353
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,200
 Well, I mean, I think if you've got three streams then it makes a lot more sense

354
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,040
 For people to join virtually than if you just have the ones so you know

355
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:54,120
 Get it out there that there will be quite a lot of program for you to engage with and I know that they're thinking about the social side as well

356
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,360
 So the other thing is that if you're doing three streams then

357
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,400
 I think probably going from zero to one is more work than going from three to four

358
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,000
 So I'm glad that they're doing some because I think it will make it easier to scale up

359
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,440
 And honestly like I don't know if I think

360
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,240
 Because there are enough um program items at least con that probably don't need streaming

361
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,560
 Um, but equally I am glad that they are doing some and I've been banging this drum

362
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,840
 I would bang in this drum since sort of I don't know

363
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:31,480
 2011 maybe but like I've wanted Easter cons to do more for supporting memberships and committing generally to do more for supporting members

364
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,400
 For a long time. So I am glad that we're kind of keeping the momentum going on that and I'm glad to that belpha star

365
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,440
 Taking that board. I think that's really really good. Um, so credit where credit is due. I reckon

366
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,800
 We we recorded a lot of the program at folicon in 1988

367
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,720
 And then

368
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 Somebody lost the real three real tapes

369
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,120
 Like, you know, oh no

370
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,560
 And you know, we'd spent quite a lot of money on the recordings. It's it's it's

371
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,800
 It's just the process after a convention of actually getting all that sorted to a doubt to be too much for the people who had done it

372
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,920
 So this this argument's been going on a long time belpha if you're planning to record things unreal to real tape

373
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,440
 Well, that was no don't do that. Well, if you're gonna do it don't lose them

374
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,400
 Hang on. Do you mean when you say don't do that?

375
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,040
 Do you mean if your planning to do it?

376
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,400
 Don't tell us or do you mean don't plan to do it?

377
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:27,560
 Don't don't do it on real three or five. They're a better they're a better more appropriate recording media

378
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,640
 for modern

379
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,840
 Have you heard of a little thing I like to call mp4?

380
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,720
 I am relatively sure that no one at uh belpha is

381
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,160
 Even vaguely considering real to real tape, but I might be wrong

382
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,080
 Anything else we want to say about belphaast. We're excited about belphaast. Oh, I'm really looking forward to belphaast

383
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,280
 I've really enjoyed the previous two conventions. I've been to there and I'm very much expecting to enjoy this one a whole lot

384
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,440
 And yes, if you're a listener and we don't already know you come and find us

385
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,160
 We will almost certainly be in the bar for some or all of the weekend. Do we want to

386
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,880
 Have do we not for pod necessarily but closer to the time?

387
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,520
 Do we want to say we will be in the bar for this 90 minute period

388
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,000
 And this will be the official time

389
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,440
 That people can come and chat to us if they'd like to and the three of us can have a drink and whoever else could join

390
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,200
 Would that be nice?

391
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,240
 Kind of like a table talk except not organized by the convention just organized by us. Yeah

392
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,280
 Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, that sounds good

393
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:35,240
 So at belphaast what we are planning to do at some point in the convention is hang out in the bar as a trio and

394
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,680
 sort of

395
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,520
 Be officially available for listeners to talk to us even more so than the usual available

396
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,240
 We are for listeners to talk to us which is very

397
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,960
 the whole of the rest of the weekend felt

398
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,600
 Without

399
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,120
 Explicit consent, please do not talk to me when I'm in my hotel room

400
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,920
 And please do not talk to me while I'm on the loo

401
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,320
 But if I'm like in the bar

402
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:05,560
 Do talk to me the show art should be the flow chart of how to tell if you can talk to john and allison and liz

403
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:11,240
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no. Okay. Yes. That will be good and it could be utterly ridiculous

404
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,440
 Though, I mean, I might not be the best person on the pod to do a flow chart

405
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,200
 I'm just saying but I probably am really I'm really excited about belphaast

406
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,680
 I'm really excited about koflu and belphaast and that whole two week period when

407
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,720
 Anytime the time in order to convention of those two week periods and firm about a week either side

408
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,320
 There are going to be people staying in my house which sauce pretty exciting. Hey

409
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,120
 So that's gonna be good

410
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,440
 [Music]

411
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:48,120
 Pics should I go first if you like so so my pick is three men in orbit by sandra bond

412
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,280
 I don't think any of us either of you two have picked it. Nope. Nope. I'm ready yet

413
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:58,840
 Okay, so three men in orbit by sandra bond. This is as you might guess from the title a pastiche

414
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,440
 of

415
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,960
 three men and about by jerem kjorom in which the three men are living in a a universe where

416
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,480
 Cavorite is fuel it has fueled a new space age

417
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,640
 Cavoritis hg wells is anti-gravity guffin thing not my guff is not quite the right word

418
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,360
 you know unexplained technology and

419
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,380
 I have been

420
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:25,480
 Chorkeling throughout because I think what's really good about it is that sandra manages to both

421
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,320
 do a very good pastiche of jerem kjorom

422
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,960
 Whilst also being funny in some of the ways that the original is funny and also some new ways

423
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,760
 Whilst also sounding distinctly like sandra who I know but but you know so having her own

424
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,240
 authorial voice as well and also bringing a lot of the kind of politics and the way people behave

425
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,760
 if not up to date because it's still clearly a victorian steampunk well-sian

426
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,360
 sort of a uh science fiction story but but sort of in a way that isn't going to

427
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,840
 jar with people reading it now and I'm just really enjoying it it's so funny every page has things

428
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,680
 that make me chorple because science fiction comedy is quite difficult right lots of people

429
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,680
 write science fiction books that are intended to be funny and aren't so when I read one that's

430
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,640
 intended to be funny and is I really like that and so I would recommend it to you all

431
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:21,320
 it's available where ever good books are sold I don't think that's true I think it's available

432
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:28,040
 from sandra or on auson or on e-pub by emailing sandra's publisher and asking for an e-pub copy

433
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,800
 and it has a lovely cover by Dan Stefan which is hilarious and perfect and I'd recommend it

434
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,480
 and you have to draw a veil over um if three people this incompetent went into space um they'd

435
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,960
 all die horribly because space is really difficult but you know I think we it's not that sort of

436
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,200
 book really they didn't drown in three men in the boat and they're not and they're not going to

437
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,840
 be sucked into the vast horrors of space of this novel either that's fair shall I do

438
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:59,640
 so I do my next all right I am going into one of my occasional forays into romance novels

439
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,080
 and I am picking a book called nine rules to break when romancing a rake by sarah mcclean

440
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,840
 this is going to be one of those books where I think if you like the idea you'll really like it

441
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,720
 and if the idea makes you go then it is pretty much what you think it's going to be and you won't

442
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,320
 like it so it's a historical romance the heroine is called lady calpernia heartwell

443
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:26,840
 it's a good name um and she is uh spinster wolflower the type always goes to the balls but never

444
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,640
 dances with anyone her younger sister has gone to the ball and made a love match and so now she's

445
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,880
 kind of feeling all the stuff she's missed out on and essentially she makes a bunch of rules

446
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,400
 of things that ladies should not do that she wants to break and inevitably she finds a dashingly

447
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,960
 handsome yet reluctant to commit rake in order to break these rules with and that's pretty much

448
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,800
 what it is it's fun it is pretty improbable in that all the rules to break are things which you

449
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,000
 know would get you thrown out of polite society but she somehow managed to break them anyway and

450
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,120
 has a lot of sex in places where you really would not get away with that I don't think and so kind

451
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,000
 of the tension is not there like you're supposed to be like oh will be discovered but you're like no

452
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,080
 you won't be discovered because then the ending of the book will be much more depressing but it's

453
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,280
 still kind of fun and the characters are great I was totally sort of won over and I sped through

454
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,680
 it in a kind of like oh I know what's gonna happen but I won't see them get together so yeah it is

455
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,720
 fun one of my biggest complaints is it does this thing that kind of modern modern historical romance

456
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,080
 books do where they do a series that are all kind of set in the same universe and so it sets up

457
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,280
 during the book the siblings and cousins and so on of the hero and heroine who are going to be

458
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,760
 the lead characters of the next book but it means you get plot threads that just never get resolved

459
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,320
 because they're going to get resolved in the next book and then you're like okay yeah fine

460
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,920
 you were setting up this concept for the next book that's nice why couldn't you do it in the next

461
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:53,720
 book but other than that I did enjoy it doesn't sound like your thing does it John Arson no have

462
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,440
 you have you read the Mars House by Natasha pulley because you might really like it but no I would

463
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,240
 I'm accepting this in like a fun romance novel which I read in an evening in a way I probably

464
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,160
 wouldn't in a book I was supposed to be thinking about seriously for such six awards I would never

465
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,360
 I wouldn't give this an award other than being fun okay so so turn your brain off and then

466
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,360
 read the Mars House because the romance bitters of it are great I quite like romance I just very

467
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:25,080
 rarely actually get round to reading it much like crime fiction really like crime fiction but

468
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:31,560
 relatively rarely actually managed to read any I read a ton of romance in my 20s before I logged

469
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:39,000
 books on the internet and now I kind of go oh well you know I haven't seen every possible plotter

470
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,280
 romance could have and I probably still will read some I can you know I read books that are not far

471
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,520
 off in that in genre and I might read some hair because I haven't really read very much

472
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,400
 or anything like that but maybe one or two a year and crime similarly lots of good crime novels

473
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,040
 that I mostly don't get round to reading yeah I would say this is nowhere near like as kind of

474
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,080
 witty as the best hair can be knows it have that social commentary to have a lot more sex so I

475
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:10,120
 do quite enjoy sex that's start the episode isn't it I I remember I remember that that was good that

476
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,560
 was a flagrant thirst trap for the listeners yeah I mean if you're going to say what you know romance

477
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,880
 published in the last 10 years Elizabeth Red would you want to read I would not put this one at the

478
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,400
 top of the pile it's probably like another 15 ahead of it but it's still fun oh what should I read if

479
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,640
 I'm going to read a romance book published in the last 15 years what would be the very best one

480
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,400
 oh well I think you should probably read some Courtney Milan it can have a lot of sex in it by

481
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,440
 the way that is fine they have less sex in it I mean there's nothing wrong with it it's just that

482
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,760
 like there's probably a bit too much of it that doesn't advance the plot and also like in

483
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,040
 probable locations like in a gentleman's fencing club and so on I have just seen the covers of

484
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:56,120
 this book oh yeah the cover is very classic like hello boobies I've been clicking my pen for five

485
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,760
 minutes sorry John you're gonna have to ignore that uh I'm just glad that we've got the episode

486
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:12,280
 title no we can't do that no no I am going to pick a movie I'm going to pick sliding doors which

487
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:19,160
 is a movie from 1998 starring Gwyneth Paltrow and John Hannah so I'm like really finger on pulse here

488
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:25,160
 peeps I thought it was going to be a romantic comedy and it isn't really it's more of a

489
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,240
 explanation or a visualization of multiverse theory with a woman who misses a train in one

490
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:38,520
 reality and catches the train in another and it sort of describes how her life diverges from that

491
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,600
 point and it's very good Gwyneth Paltrow is very good in it I thought but John Hannah stole the

492
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,080
 show for me I thought he was excellent and I think it is probably science fiction I thought it was

493
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:54,760
 very well done I had not seen anything do what it did quite like it does it the ending is a little

494
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,320
 bit melancholy and kind of I think explicitly genre in general I thought it was really very good

495
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:08,120
 so I would recommend it to listeners I saw this movie in the cinemas in 1988 in 1998 so yeah

496
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:14,280
 or maybe 1999 you know but that's all the time it's cat lips of Londoners because it it does two

497
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,480
 things that Londoners love in movies it has lots of stuff that's kind of London being it's prettiest

498
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,640
 and it also has ludicrous geography so that people can mushroom complain about it sometimes I'm very

499
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,760
 glad I don't live in London yes I think it's a great movie and I'd say it was science fiction yeah

500
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:37,000
 it's two parallel universes yeah I saw it but probably in about 2000 some things that I have no

501
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,480
 memory of it hey I liked it that was good is it on the list of our top 100 science fiction movies of

502
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:52,040
 all time because it probably ought to be no it is not we did also we did continue to go through that

503
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:59,480
 but I don't think I've got any pics from it I think that might be it I feel a bit incoherent but so

504
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,600
 listeners if you're feeling the lack of a deep topic that we might get into that we didn't get

505
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,480
 into this episode right and tell us what it should be for another time yeah because we have just done

506
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,480
 all the stuff around the edges of the deep top of the big topic of the week but haven't done a big

507
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,520
 talk with week but we've been kind of plenty long enough so you know please do continue to write in

508
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:26,360
 with your Hugo award recommendations if you haven't already done so or if you read anything that's

509
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,960
 eligible between now and the end of nominations we would love to hear about them that would be

510
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:38,200
 great that was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye for me it's goodbye for me and it's goodbye

511
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:46,200
 for me

512
00:41:46,760 --> 00:42:05,240
 what's Elden square do you want it's a square with a statue of Elden in it that's not as helpful as

513
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:11,880
 it's I don't know what you want me I mean it's uh it's in Newcastle city center uh there's also a

514
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,440
 shopping center named after it but I imagine he was actually in the square he might have been in the

515
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:24,280
 shopping center don't know oh I like this it is bordered by a nando a wagamama a burger place

516
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:32,680
 and a micro pub sometimes it has things in it like stalls of a market it's a short walk away from

517
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,680
 monument metro station no I did assume he meant the shopping center um so you know maybe it was just

518
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,640
 three yes so like shall I read from the wikipedia page of the shopping center um which says it

519
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:49,000
 Elden square the shopping center now rebranded as uh what she was rebranded as into Elden square and

520
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,520
 is now stylized as Elden square apparently was built on site of old Elden square a famous part of

521
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,080
 georgia Newcastle this redevelopment which left only the eastern terra stunning has been criticized

522
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,680
 with writer calling it the greatest single example of architectural vandalism in britain since the

523
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,800
 war sounds splendid oh oh I think there are a few competitors for that has he been to south

524
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,000
 ampton yeah I was gonna say the the Grafton centering Cambridge but I don't know what that was built

525
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 on top off old Elden square which was a public square no no no the Grafton center oh they demolished

526
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,560
 um loads of victorian terra's housing to make it oh it was it was that it was an absolute outrage

527
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:38,520
 oh uston station also yeah uston station is an abomination that is true anyway that was our

528
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:44,760
 olden square corner sorry I didn't realize it was going to spin off like that neither did I or I

529
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,080
 would never have gone there listeners right in with your favorite architectural disasters of the

530
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:57,400
 UK hey I have a I have an anecdote about Patrick Nielsen Hayden and UK architecture which you know

531
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:04,040
 he'd be going around beautiful bits of British of British cities and see hideous brutalist buildings

532
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:10,040
 and people would explain oh oh the war you know it's an area that was bombed and he hadn't realized

533
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,000
 that the buffer had been in the business of dropping concrete monstrosities all over the country

534
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,320
 if you go to the european cities that were bombed you just you do not discover hideous

535
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,120
 brutalist buildings in them as a rule but they're kind of knocking down the hideous ones and so

536
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,600
 only the good brutalist buildings will be left at some point and then people will go oh I don't know

537
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:35,080
 why everyone was so down on brutalism shall we move on from architecture corner it's not a statue

538
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:41,880
 of lord elton it's a war memorial so that was our factually incorrect architecture corner it's

539
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:49,960
 what you're telling me yeah but apparently it's st george okay who just happens to look a bit like

540
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,280
 lord elton i've never really looked at me and didn't really know what lord elton looked like it just

541
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,360
 sort of made sense to me that there's a statue in a square named after a bloke probably a statue

542
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:04,600
 of the bloke but no the theme music for this episode was fanfare for space by kevin mccloud
