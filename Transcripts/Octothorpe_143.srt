00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,180
And thus it was, Alison announced her retirement from the podcast.

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,560
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 143rd episode of Octothorpe,

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,660
a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,260
which is going downstairs to get some pizza

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,060
and coming back to a room that appears to be on fire on the 11th of September 2025.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,660
I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm Alison Scott.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,280
And I'm Liz Batty.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,400
And today we have Alison back.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,420
We do, though I'm very troubled by how we had tons of letters of comment saying how marvellous Lori was.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,980
So I'm afraid we're back to your normal not-so-marvellous service.

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,200
I mean, Lori can't help being marvellous.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,440
I also do not own any bra tape.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,580
And I was going to write you a letter of comment last time.

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,060
I did not write a letter of comment, but had I done, it would have said,

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,780
Lori really didn't need to worry about whether I was concerned about what had happened to the roll of ribbon I gave her.

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,680
Because when I gave her the ribbon, it went out of my life.

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,780
And I no longer felt any responsibility for it or to it.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,980
I did say that. I was like, you can't be worried about Alison following up on these things.

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,060
Because, yeah.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,120
100%.

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,460
But yes, no, Lori was very good.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,040
And we talked about books and everything.

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,820
I really enjoyed listening to the podcast.

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,180
I'd like to listen to it every time.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,020
That sounds really good.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,040
We could just have a series of stunt Alisons.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,360
And thus it was.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,120
Alison announced her retirement from the podcast.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,100
No.

31
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,280
Don't retire, Alison.

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,080
That would be double plus on good.

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,440
Especially don't retire by announcing it on the podcast.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,860
Oh, I feel like if I retire from the podcast,

35
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,880
it's likely to happen while we record.

36
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,700
on past evidence.

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,140
Here's another thing I might have written in my lock,

38
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,620
as well as remarking on Lori's dress.

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,800
John said a little bit in the last episode

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,240
about Randy Shepard commenting on Dune.

41
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,320
And Randy's done this before.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,780
A couple of years ago, I saw him

43
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,220
allegedly accept Hugo on behalf of a studio,

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,860
but in practice use that to have a diatribe about the studios who don't respond.

45
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,260
Now there's two things.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:35,500
The first is that the vast majority of studios for game and for best long-form and short-form dramatic presentation do respond.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,560
And we've been working with them as finalist liaisons.

48
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,840
And they are just as happy and delighted to be finalists as anybody else would be.

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,140
There are exceptions.

50
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,200
And in those cases, it's almost certainly that our email isn't getting to the right desk,

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,060
which is a problem in a big studio and in a big environment.

52
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,460
That's not really a problem with the studios.

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,140
And I feel like we really shouldn't be saying this sort of thing on stage.

54
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,780
It's unfortunate that not everybody responds,

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,260
but it's not something that we should be making big public pronouncements about.

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,380
And I think it's unprofessional of the ceremony director to use that platform to say things like that.

57
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:25,460
And I think you're right. I'm going to say one exception is Nintendo. I think they just have a policy of ignoring everything.

58
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,920
Oh, yeah. No, Nintendo could get it as son.

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,080
But yeah, I think it is tricky. Like we did it. We managed to make contact with someone on the Mad Max Furiosa team.

60
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,300
But it was like two weeks before the ceremony, before we finally got a lead in.

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,580
And it was because one of the other finalists had a friend who'd worked on it.

62
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:51,380
And I do think it is, I don't know whether the ceremony directors are aware of how difficult it is to contact some of these people.

63
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:57,640
Because we, like, it was Nicholas doing the emailing at this point because he had not yet resigned.

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,020
He sent multiple emails trying to contact various of the BDP finalists.

65
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,440
And sometimes it worked, but sometimes you sent like six emails and you don't get the person that you need.

66
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,840
and with Dragon Age the Veilguard the person we were in touch with at EA got made redundant between

67
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,540
making contact and the ceremony so like I think if that had won I don't know if there would have been

68
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,580
a speech but that was because EA that was because EA made someone redundant and it's like I don't

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,620
think it's because the people who worked on the game didn't care I believe the venture capitalists

70
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,959
in charge of EA might not care it's really tricky capitalism's hard I think the people making the

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,180
art might care more than the people counting the beans and um i think randy's anger might be better

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:48,420
directed at the beans hariko i'm just gonna say beans are hard too it's not surprising that teams

73
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,040
get broken up when projects are completed if your beans are hard you should boil them longer awards

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,540
management is probably something that studios should have a greater awareness of and have a

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,220
plan for i think we're at the point now with the hugos where the vast majority of people directing

76
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,600
science fiction films read science fiction in their youth and knew about the hugos and we are seeing

77
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,380
that in the comments that they make when when they write to us and how excited they are to come to the

78
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:24,019
world con and be at the ceremony so this episode marks the return of an important person to octothorpe

79
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,960
and that person is a luminary in the field,

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,240
a Hugo Award winner,

81
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,280
and wears excellent t-shirts.

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,420
I speak, of course, of Christopher J. Garcia,

83
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,960
who has written us a letter.

84
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:36,020
Yay!

85
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,140
And he has lots of things to say.

86
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,240
The number of Hugo trophies vary every year

87
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,200
between three and as many as you need.

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
When we won and we were a five-person team,

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,820
we got five.

90
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,480
And I guess that's the other thing,

91
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,780
which is the convention will make

92
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,180
a certain number of trophies,

93
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,660
And I guess there's no reason that that number of trophies is the number of winners.

94
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,700
So if you have more, if you have fewer trophies, you might have to charge to get more made.

95
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,260
But if you have more, then some teams might get, you know, more than three.

96
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,900
So that's actually good feedback, but couched in a very Garcia way.

97
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,980
So I appreciated it on two levels, Chris.

98
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,940
We're going to come back to this later, but he says,

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,500
On the other hand, I've mispronounced names during a Worldcon masquerade for MetaHead

100
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,960
and someone whose name I have said hundreds of times and can say today.

101
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,220
that said there's a level of mistake that's acceptable on stage john's mispronunciation

102
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,340
of claire's name is a great example but this clearly went beyond that he says i'm complete

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,400
i'm absolutely full of hate that seattle hasn't seemed to have apologized for the problems

104
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,860
um looking at la cons blow up they got their apology out in a few hours

105
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,260
and well yeah we're going to come back to that chris but you foreshadow some of our sentiment

106
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,799
he does indeed it's almost like chris is very in vibe with this podcast and he also says that

107
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,400
Edmonton has phenomenal Ukrainian food and I'm looking forward to phenomenal Ukrainian food.

108
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,220
That sounds really good. We heard from Alan Fleming and David Bamford.

109
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,520
That's interesting. It's from both of them but it uses the single person first person singular.

110
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,720
As long as I've been in fandom this must be Alan. It seems that conventions have consistently been

111
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,399
terrible at advertising both what conventions are and advertising that to the widest potential

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,220
market in advance. I can't say we'll do any better, but as co-chairs of the 2027 Eastercon,

113
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,880
it's called Unconfined and we'll put the URL in the show notes. It's something of which we are

114
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,160
acutely aware. People volunteer when they learn about conventions and fandom, but we need to

115
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,760
advertise away from our traditional avenues in order to recruit the next generation of convention

116
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,319
lovers. That has to be online and creating campaigns using tools and platforms with which

117
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,100
few of us are familiar because that's where the potential new audience is at. I think one of the

118
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,520
reasons why we have embraced Discord to some extent is that that's one of the places our audience is

119
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:01,000
at but I agree they have to find Discord first and also saying as people who are helping running

120
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,520
conventions you can't volunteer all of the time at a senior level burnout is and has always been

121
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,780
real and they're taking a step back for the conventions in advance of their Eastercon which

122
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,280
I think is probably quite sensible. I believe in other roles having a great pool of volunteers and

123
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,220
area heads and maybe even future chairs is to make sure that there are strong local and national

124
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:24,160
conventions um and that's definitely true and that is why the fact that a lot of these conventions

125
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:30,100
are disappearing in the u.s is is such a problem one of the things that made us want to start a

126
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,180
local group in newcastle was that it seemed like the through route of like local groups into fandom

127
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:42,760
was was faltering um because that's how i got into fandom mostly was the p of a group um but

128
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,040
if that doesn't exist then you're going to struggle we heard from jake seller brookins and i'm going

129
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,660
to take his uh letter and facebook comment because he says the thank you diagrams and the hugo stats

130
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:00,320
release are great thank you um i think casella did them last year maybe for an artillery review of

131
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,840
books or possibly the year before basically various people have done them before and i like them and so

132
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,600
i decided we should just do them automatically and spent quite a long time figuring out the code in

133
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,140
order to do that and it was probably more effort than it was worth but I still quite like them so

134
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,040
thank you everyone who has enjoyed the figures but will it work automatically every year now Liz

135
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,820
yes if they have my code and can run it because it's not particularly like it's not documented

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,740
it's like it takes the dump from something and you run this and then you run that and also it has

137
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,920
some tweaks because I didn't properly account for things like it doesn't properly calculate things

138
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,440
like how many rounds of eliminations there were I just sort of hardcoded it as six and then had to go

139
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,840
oh no wait there are only five in that one so it doesn't really do the it's not kind of just turn

140
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,740
the handle but it's fairly turn the handle so no then well yes and no right like it is not a piece

141
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,820
of code where you push one button and the graphs come out but it's a piece of code where you might

142
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,040
have to tweak half a dozen things and then the graphs come out yeah it's it's it's the it's it's

143
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,820
up to it's academic code yeah like if you want to run it and you've got the email address of the

144
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,200
person who wrote it it will take you maybe half an hour to get it working yeah that's fair because

145
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,300
Stella also says, how dare you impugn June 2?

146
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,480
Sarcasm.

147
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,500
Villeneuve is a generational talent when it comes to filming sand,

148
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,480
not actually sarcasm.

149
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,100
Yeah.

150
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,840
He is.

151
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,660
That is true.

152
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,780
That is a good point.

153
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,920
The sand does look good.

154
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,060
And it's much better use of sand than, say, you know,

155
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,500
the discussions of sand in Star Wars.

156
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,540
How dare you?

157
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,860
Not Phantom Menace.

158
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,580
What's the next one, John?

159
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,300
Attack of the Clones.

160
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,780
Yeah, Star Wars Attack of the Clones,

161
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,520
which is the other notable sand discussion I can think of.

162
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,400
Compared to Lawrence of Arabia.

163
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,200
I think we should talk about Lawrence of Arabia here.

164
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,660
Attack of the Clones has attained memetic dominance

165
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,040
and Villeneuve's films have not made an impact

166
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,620
on the cultural discussion of sand at all.

167
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,560
George Lucas, preeminent sand discusser.

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,500
I mean, there is a lot of sand in the Dune films.

169
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,100
Yeah, which makes it all the more remarkable

170
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,100
that not any of it has reached GIF status.

171
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,900
Look, right, Lucas didn't do much good with the prequels,

172
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,340
but that scene was very GIF-able.

173
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,980
I'm not sure I recognise the GIF.

174
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,100
Well, it's not. It's actually a meme, isn't it?

175
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,500
I don't care about Lawrence of Arabia.

176
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,000
Lawrence of Arabia is not a genre movie.

177
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,100
Well, I mean, it's a major movie in the sand genre, really.

178
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,660
And it does have aliens in it.

179
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,380
Sari Polvinen writes in.

180
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,180
I'm very sorry if I've pronounced that incorrectly.

181
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,060
Sorry, please let us know.

182
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,720
I talked a little bit about Finland and FinCon,

183
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,600
and I said Finnish fandom right in, and Sari did.

184
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,620
So thank you very much.

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So Finland's con culture is very different from the Anglo-American one,

186
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,740
And it's one of the reasons why there won't be another world con bid from Finland anytime soon.

187
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,120
There's no culture of bidding for Fincons.

188
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,140
Fincon is a con that is basically organized in rotation in four cities.

189
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,480
Helsinki, Tampere, Turku and Ivaskela.

190
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,620
And when Findom, which is a great word, is organizing another big event like Archipelagon,

191
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,580
it usually means that Fincon sits out.

192
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,480
And there was also no Fincon in 2017.

193
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,200
So like the 2025 thing was not part of a global trend.

194
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,000
It's part of a Finnish trend.

195
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,600
Interestingly, although the influx of volunteers at Worldcon brings that you mentioned did happen in Finland after 2017,

196
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,840
and it did bring volunteers to the national fandom,

197
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,760
it also inspired proportionally even more people to go to and volunteer in European Worldcons.

198
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,780
So maybe there is a new generation of Finnish fans who are more at home with Worldcon culture.

199
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,220
And then, yes, thank you very much.

200
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
That is a very good comment, and that is useful to know.

201
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,400
And, yeah, thank you for writing in.

202
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:29,860
Information knowledge.

203
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
All knowledge is contained in the listeners.

204
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,020
Yeah, and I think it just shows that when we do try and draw generalisations

205
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,980
between different countries, they can only go so far

206
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,920
because the cultures are just different.

207
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,820
And we don't know the ins and outs of all of them.

208
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,520
Yes.

209
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,380
So, Doug Faunt wrote in to say,

210
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,900
I'm at Worldcon and John Hertz is sharing my room.

211
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,100
I'll tell him he was mentioned.

212
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,100
Please tell us what John said, Doug.

213
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,160
But thank you very much for letting him know.

214
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,560
And Jesse Lip wrote in,

215
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,340
I was correct, shocking,

216
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,160
The whispers is appointed two managers or prosecutors.

217
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,260
They use the word manager to avoid the term from the criminal justice system.

218
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:13,340
And those managers will make the whispers case to the members of the trial committee who will act as the jury and judge.

219
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,720
So like the equivalent of the jury and judge.

220
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,320
And Warren Buff and Randy Shepard are the two managers.

221
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,440
The trial committee reports back to the LA meeting with findings and recommendations.

222
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,140
And then there is a majority vote to either adopt or reject their findings.

223
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:36,400
so that is how it will work thank you very much for writing in jesse i also wanted to pick out a

224
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,220
comment that frederick colter made seattle was his first world con since 1992 and his fourth

225
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,000
world con overall poverty followed by children put a big cramp on his vanish activities that

226
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,600
seems like a double whammy that would do that given the length of the agenda of the business meeting

227
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,620
virtual pre-convention meetings are essential because there's just not enough time and i did

228
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,980
not do this um he says second we did manage to address one additional item at the convention

229
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,960
um so there was they did take up the rest of the agenda after site selection and they considered

230
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,860
the artist hugo reform proposal but i have not read the minutes he's like you might want to read

231
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,920
the minutes before the next episode i did not do that so we should do that for next time i haven't

232
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,940
seen them and i did look for them but i haven't seen them so if someone's got the minutes can

233
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,700
they point us at them listen have you seen the minutes for the hugo bit for the artist bit no i

234
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,500
haven't looked at official minutes i mean i think they did take up that one and then i think vote

235
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,980
send everything else to committee which is basically a way of say it'll come back next time but we will

236
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,920
look when the actual minutes are here oh we've been around this loop a few times with artist

237
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,240
yeah keep sending it to committee i don't know if we sent artists to committee i think we sent the

238
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,720
other things on the agenda to committee uh okay interesting oh that would make more sense yes okay

239
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,680
frederick also makes a point um which is basically on the subject of conventions going away um

240
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,820
Since he retired a month or three ago, he has more time to go to conventions, but the number of local cons has plummeted.

241
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,440
As far as he can tell, there's only one left in Florida, which I presume is where he lives.

242
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,360
And that is not great because there should, yeah, a country that size, you'd expect there to be more.

243
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,540
But the one thing that retirement has done for him is open up his time.

244
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,540
he basically says it in addition to trying to get younger fans involved it might also be productive

245
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,020
to get old geezers who had life getting in the way of fan-ish activities to get back into convention

246
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,540
and like i know for instance like i think there are some com runners at high levels um who are

247
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,260
basically people who used to have full-time jobs who have now retired and are bringing their expertise

248
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,680
to bear me and some other people are exploring taking on ownership of the northeast tabletop

249
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,780
Expo because it has been relinquished by its current runners and one of the considerations

250
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,400
the rest of the committee is very keen on and they're like if this becomes a full-time job we

251
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,040
want to be able to draw a part of a salary because it will be a full-time job and I'm like this is

252
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,420
very different to the Worldcon where people do the full-time job but it would be laughed out of court

253
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:04,520
if you tried to suggest they get paid for it but it might not be tenable to expect people who have

254
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,880
jobs to do that like to do a second full-time job that does limit the pool quite a lot but yeah

255
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,420
thank you frederick there was a lot of food for thought in your lot i mean i think that's very

256
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,560
reasonable but it seems to me that you'll have to be running a very big expo to get anywhere near

257
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,520
the amount of money needed to pay even a part-time salary to someone i don't think that's necessarily

258
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,980
true i think game convention finances work quite a bit differently to science fiction convention

259
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,660
conventions but like air con's only been running a decade and like admittedly it's big but it's in

260
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,800
harrogate convention center so it maybe gets for a games convention it's not that big and it has

261
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:48,120
someone working uh two days a week on it as salaried stuff yeah the um i always look at

262
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:54,020
folk festivals and the way they have moved from being um committee-run volunteer events to

263
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,780
largely company they vary a lot but companies limited by guarantee where at least one person

264
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,100
is getting paid for admin work and it's the same sort of thing that the amount of admin work has

265
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,240
become too large to have it operate on a voluntary basis and i don't really have a problem with the

266
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:19,500
idea of having someone paid to do that stuff i think that is probably sensible from the perspective

267
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,880
of from the perspective of not burning volunteers out like if you can have one or two people doing

268
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,600
work in that way that is probably something that will lighten your volunteer load in a good way

269
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,620
so i don't know and it's tricky right because there was a good discussion in anonymous claire

270
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:44,980
about how people feel about volunteering for kind of corporations and like you know there's a

271
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,600
consideration there where you don't want to give your voluntary time to a for-profit company to

272
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,900
help them make a bigger profit but you you know if if worldcon had paid for a day a week of like

273
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,480
the chair's time would that have meant the worldcon went smoothly for any given world more smoothly

274
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,540
for any given worldcon maybe it would have done and like i don't know whether there's the money

275
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,160
to do that but there might be it's an interesting thought experiment i think yeah and i wouldn't be

276
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,679
against it i just think you know if you think let's say let's say we try and employ you try

277
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,980
apply someone for two days a week in the uk minimum wage whatever you probably need about

278
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,640
10 grand which is yeah not insurmountable um but it means whatever you're doing needs to get

279
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,460
like 10 grand basically of surplus assuming that person is happy to be paid the minimum yeah yeah

280
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,840
i think you're probably right i think that's the absolute benefit but yeah i mean and it's a

281
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,560
consideration i don't know if it would work for easter cons because i don't but i think that

282
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,700
partly because we don't charge enough for easter con which is a conversation we keep coming back

283
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,260
to. I think the membership for East Con is stupidly cheap. Maybe we'll come back to it when you hire

284
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,480
someone. And of course there are many corporate structures in the UK for operating with a mixed

285
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:02,640
economy of paid staff and volunteers and indeed Mike Scott wrote to us to point out that two of

286
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:09,320
our emergency services, the lifeboats and mountain rescue, are almost entirely staffed by volunteers

287
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,560
Of course, both of those will have paid stuff as well and probably all be incorporated as charities.

288
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,480
But I do not know.

289
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,340
RNLI is a charity because they have charity shops.

290
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,460
Yeah, there's a lot of lifeboats that aren't RNLI though, which is something I only just discovered.

291
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,720
I bought something that was, this is raising funds for the Independent Lifeboat Association.

292
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,000
I was like, the what?

293
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,780
And there's hundreds of independent lifeboats.

294
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,920
I had no idea.

295
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,880
Interesting.

296
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,360
mountain rescue is a charitable incorporated organization listeners right in because i don't

297
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,700
know what the difference between that and charity is but the fact it doesn't say charity makes me

298
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,580
think there is one and let's move on from discussions of charities to the facebook

299
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,420
comments on 142 liz do you want to take the lead on those we also got some facebook comments on

300
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:05,220
our last episode thank you to everyone who was very nice about our stunt allison lorry um

301
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,820
Meg McDonald points out that Glasgow 2024 did have to issue an apology for the Hugo ceremony,

302
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,580
which I'd forgotten about, which was because there were mistakes in the Chinese captions on the slides,

303
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,040
which obviously I didn't notice at the time.

304
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,200
Meg says they had a crisis com plan and a complex coms triage and management process

305
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,980
for the number of issues that they had to communicate with members and the wider public,

306
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,940
which sounds very good.

307
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,420
Yes.

308
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,960
We also heard from Sheila La, who enjoyed Lori's ribbon story.

309
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,740
We got a comment from Lori Anderson, who likes the title of her episode.

310
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,460
We also heard from Ali Baker Brooks and Farrah Mendelsohn.

311
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,400
Mike Scott says, John, there were seven seasons of Deep Space Nine.

312
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,120
A message I know has been relayed to John through multiple channels.

313
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,900
But John, there were seven seasons of Deep Space Nine.

314
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,940
I didn't correct you at the time because I thought, no, I'll leave it for our listeners to write in.

315
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,180
And they did.

316
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,500
It's still too many.

317
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,500
That's like more than The Expanse, isn't it?

318
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,100
The Expanse is too many.

319
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,220
Just throw it up and finish The Expanse, Alison.

320
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,240
We are going to finish The Expanse.

321
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,120
you will

322
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,680
just not necessarily a 2025

323
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,080
I mean at some point you should just admit you don't like it and stop watching

324
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:09,900
oh hello

325
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:10,880
oh hello

326
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,300
if it was just me I would have done that

327
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,500
alright anyway

328
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,540
there are seven series of Deep Space Nine

329
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,740
Roger Coulter wrote us another

330
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,520
letter of comment on the latest episode

331
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,400
to say that a follow up

332
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,700
he reached out to both LA and Montreal about volunteering

333
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,960
yay excellent

334
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,520
and that yes the pronunciation guide

335
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,940
for the Hugo should have been prepared

336
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:39,040
i have some guidelines from toastmasters about how you actually lay out uh a script so that you don't

337
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,160
end up missing anything you know you don't end up anything trailing over onto another page you don't

338
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,260
end up missing anything and that you should have it all in a binder which all sounds very sensible

339
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,420
yes i mean that's sort of what we talked about last time like but yeah you there's there's errors

340
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,180
that you can make there's errors that you can prevent in the layout process that will make

341
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,920
these things less likely to happen they won't make them impossible but they will make them less likely

342
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:08,840
what you want do we want to do the skeets as well got some skeets paul wemer skeeted to say he also

343
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,040
heard hugo road in the sound of the train bells on the way to the airport so it's clearly a thing

344
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,820
yes that's good i like that thank you for writing in paul we also sort of got a lot from gotham

345
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,360
butier to say that uh there is going to be a book set in the same world as the sentence and he is

346
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,360
working on it right now and that's very exciting um so yes looking forward to that and raj bought

347
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:40,240
the wrong book called the sentence um so yeah that is that is distressing i mean maybe that

348
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,160
one was good too right in raj let us know sorry raj

349
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,280
so listeners uh we think we probably can't record an episode next time so we have pre-recorded

350
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,140
a bonus episode for your enjoyment

351
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,060
and it is on the movie Dread.

352
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,100
So if you would like to watch

353
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,120
the movie Dread, then you will be well

354
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,900
prepared for our bonus episode.

355
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,380
And optionally, you can also

356
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,220
listen to Tansy Gardam's podcast

357
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,280
on Dread, which she released

358
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,880
slightly before our podcast on Dread

359
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,300
and is much better. But anyway, listen to us.

360
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,380
It's only, it's much better

361
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,200
in some ways, but she does prefer The Raid,

362
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,180
so she is wrong. Oh, I like The Raid though.

363
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,240
I haven't seen The Raid. Unfortunately,

364
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,880
Dread is not available for free streaming anywhere in the UK,

365
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,160
but you can rent it for £3.50 on the internet.

366
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,640
And it may be available in other territories for free.

367
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,700
It's available in my house for free because I have it on Blu-ray.

368
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,040
So everyone just come to my house.

369
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,260
Open invitation.

370
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,320
The art this time is an illustration by Arthur Thompson,

371
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
which has not previously been published.

372
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:51,420
It was the art for the column head of a Walt Willis column

373
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,220
in the issue of Hyphen that would have been the next one

374
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,740
if there had been another one, but there wasn't.

375
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,140
And I'm very glad that we have the opportunity to publish it now.

376
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,200
And it means that it will be eligible for best fanzine cover

377
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,900
in the fan awards,

378
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,220
were it not for the fact that we're not a fanzine, so it isn't.

379
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,140
But, you know, thank you very much, Adam,

380
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,680
for inadvertently doing us an Octothorpe cover.

381
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,320
Yes, hurrah.

382
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,260
And I've been meaning to use it for months,

383
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,160
so, you know, because I bought it to the Corflux auction.

384
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,660
It's a good bit of art. I like it.

385
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:40,860
One of the things that I missed as a result of not being here last week and you having to have a stunt Alison was that I missed being apoplectically angry about the Hugos and the result of it.

386
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:47,760
And now I've been in Germany for a few days chilling and drinking local beer and I'm not apoplectically angry anymore.

387
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:56,600
So, but at the time of recording, we still do not have any sort of apology for the mispronunciations.

388
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,720
I did draw a cover for you, though.

389
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,360
Yes, it was very good.

390
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,880
It had a Iron Throne made of Hugo Award, which was lovely.

391
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm glad you knew what it was, because Stephen was like, I don't know what that is meant to be.

392
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
And I said, really?

393
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,580
Come on, Stephen.

394
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,200
Maybe I should draw better.

395
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,380
Maybe if I could draw better.

396
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,760
Listeners who look at the show notes will know that I put the alt text for the image in the show notes.

397
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,500
and so if you don't understand a reference it is often explained in the alt text in the show notes

398
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:32,320
so that is the the the way to find out if you're unsure fun fact sometimes john explains references

399
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,560
i didn't put in the picture oh what do you mean when what how does that work

400
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,100
you've said oh this is very funny because of x and i was like oh i had not realized i did x

401
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,720
i think that i am not it is a problem when the hosts mispronounce names on stage but accidents

402
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,760
happen mistakes are made and honestly the thing that affects my reaction much more is how quickly

403
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,640
you apologize and how sincere apology happens to or how sincere your apology appears to be

404
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,780
and if there had been a full apology on the sunday or the monday saying we are really sorry for the

405
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,140
people whose names were mispronounced and didn't read out on stage it was because of process errors

406
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,420
in the ceremony that we're going to address by talking to LA and Montreal about what they could

407
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,920
do differently and again we are really really sorry I'd be completely unfazed by this and sitting

408
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:28,600
here in a state of complete peace and calm but the fact that at the time of the recording it's now

409
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,000
been over two weeks since they made the mistake and that's what's making me really angry at this

410
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,480
point like say sorry you did you did wrong thing and you say sorry and the saying sorry is important

411
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,280
and it reflects onto the sort of person you are if you don't or the sort of organization you are

412
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,920
if you don't and i think that reflects badly on the hosts and on seattle at this point so i'm a

413
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,220
bit cross listeners but yeah that's basically the only update i have they'll probably have apologized

414
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,720
by the time this episode comes out though i swear to i hope they have yeah i think the reason i was

415
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,679
angry was because i knew because i'd worked on it that the um wussford's administration the

416
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,040
WSFUs division had collected all the pronunciation information and had passed that information to

417
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:20,100
events and the process of generating a ceremony had failed to generate the sort of scripts that

418
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,740
Frederick Coulter mentioned earlier with all the names embedded in it which seems to me to be

419
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:32,040
a key part of the job that you wouldn't not do that bit that's why I was angry so I'm still

420
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,660
channeling kind of leftover anger there i don't think we have anything else on seattle's apology

421
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:45,680
and stuff like another thing at seattle that caused consternation was so the chair of the

422
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,100
mark protection committee donald eastlake the third attended a mark protection committee meeting

423
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:59,060
at seattle um having tested positive for covid and proceeded to take his mask off in the meeting

424
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,800
and was then asked to leave the convention.

425
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,460
File 770 has a post about this where Donald answers questions.

426
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,400
He says, I'm not sure this was a code of conduct violation.

427
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,800
There is a separate health policy that I had not read.

428
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,700
The health policy says, even if you do not feel sick, which I did not,

429
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,140
if you have tested positive for COVID, please do not attend.

430
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,640
It is my fault for not reading the health policy in advance

431
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,220
or otherwise really realizing the error in what I did.

432
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,620
So I'm going to say that I don't think, maybe I'm off base here,

433
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,920
but if you've tested positive for COVID or flu,

434
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,760
or you strongly suspect you have norovirus,

435
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,720
and you go to a convention in that knowledge,

436
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,440
then you, that's bad.

437
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,660
And I feel like I'm insane, because I'm like,

438
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,280
I thought we knew that was bad.

439
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,900
Did we not know that was bad?

440
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,240
This did a giggle, which is why I've like my voice has gone up.

441
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,280
But yeah, like if you've got COVID.

442
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,460
Yeah, I'm trying to think of like,

443
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,760
apparently we need to put in the code of conduct

444
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,960
that violating the health policy and coming in.

445
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,880
Well, you know, you have COVID.

446
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,300
It's a violation of the code of conduct.

447
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,260
But it's like if I was projectile vomiting

448
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,800
and decided to come into the convention,

449
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,740
then I think that would be a code of conduct violation.

450
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,840
Like even if it wasn't explicitly written in the code of conduct.

451
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:27,340
If you have mumps, if you have measles, if you have whooping cough, also don't go to the convention.

452
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,240
Like, this isn't a COVID thing.

453
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,000
It's like, it's a disease.

454
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,760
Like, if you are confirmed diseased.

455
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,800
Diphtheria, tuberculosis, leprosy.

456
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,420
Oh, God.

457
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:50,900
Like, I don't want to disenfranchise people, but I think discriminating on the basis of disease vector is reasonable.

458
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:56,640
yeah and i mean we've had loads of conversations about in this current era there are some discussion

459
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,560
about whether people with symptoms which could be the symptoms of an infectious disease but are not

460
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,040
necessarily and they don't appear to have an infectious disease whether you should come to

461
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,760
the con or not but we're not even in that territory we're in the territory of you definitely have it

462
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,379
and you thought i'll come to a meeting and take my mask off it's just weird don't understand it

463
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,920
I'm so cross, but I'm also so confused that it's undercutting my crossness.

464
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,940
I can't understand it to such an extent it makes me laugh rather than making me want to yell.

465
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:29,200
Well, I think the thing that I find strange is why would somebody...

466
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,500
If you want to carry on attending the convention despite the fact that you might have COVID,

467
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,800
the thing to do is to not test, right?

468
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,400
Why would somebody test and then go, oh, I've had a positive test,

469
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,200
but I'll carry on doing just what I was going to do anyway?

470
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:49,720
what was it was it in the covid was it 2021 where it was it was it was reporter six at an american

471
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,340
convention who tested positive on the thursday and then there was a massive list of all the places

472
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,900
they had been after testing positive i can't remember which convention it was i remember we

473
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,980
talked about it on the pod there was there was a us convention i think it i don't know if it was

474
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,800
discord or maybe it was like one of the other cons um that was reported these but yeah it was like

475
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,379
person well they were positive and they went to all these things and then thought they'd mention

476
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,680
it later oh i was positive i better report that uh but yeah yeah anyway john i think you are missing

477
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,900
out i think you've missed out the best part uh which is that donald eastlake was re-elected as

478
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,140
the chair of the moral protection committee i want to know from the minutes who voted to re-elect him

479
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,900
because i think someone with that level of i have worked with donald eastlake and i have thought

480
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,319
that he was not a particularly switched on person for a while but i think if you voted to confirm

481
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,100
of his chair after this like you need your head examined for covid well if you were there and

482
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,260
you re-elected him you should probably at the least go and take a rapid test yeah

483
00:31:52,540 --> 00:32:02,759
it was noted on blue sky and this was actually long enough ago at 13 27 on the 21st of august

484
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:11,820
2025 wayo de old bear did a post on blue sky basically pointing out that the los angeles world

485
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:17,860
con had some theming on its website which was reminiscent of westward expansion and manifest

486
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,860
destiny um so they were referring to their guests as pioneers they were referring to their venue as

487
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,619
the frontier um the con newsletter was called the telegram and they had like a picture of a mission

488
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:35,180
in one of the icons on their menu um and i don't i don't i don't think that's a completely exhaustive

489
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,260
list but i do think it's it's it's kind of it gets most of the problems that were noted um later that

490
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:51,840
day there was a statement from the la con 5 chair joyce lloyd which um basically said it starts with

491
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,759
la con 5 apologizes for using words and icons that connote western expansion and the displacement

492
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,500
and colonization of indigenous peoples this does not reflect the vision or values of the convention

493
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:07,000
and at the point that statement was made which i think was about 12 hours after the original skeet

494
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,900
la had completely removed those things from their website it was it was incredibly fast reaction

495
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,540
and then actually um weo the old bear who had been the person who originally noted it skeet is saying

496
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,740
that they were genuinely happy and surprised to see a change in an apology and they tweeted

497
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:35,400
or sorry they skeeted that on the 21st of august at 1944 so the original skeet was 13 27 and the

498
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,540
follow-up was 1944 which is a six-hour turnaround so i'd done them dirty i'd said it took them twice

499
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:48,520
as long to respond as it had compare and contrast listeners um six hours versus the 14 times 24

500
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:55,220
336 hours it has taken seattle to apologize uh for their fuck up and i wanted to talk about this

501
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:01,480
a little bit because it wasn't good that la con did this and i don't think i think one thing i

502
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,100
want to say is like this website had been up for over a year at the point that this was noticed and

503
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,800
no one else had picked up on it and there must have been lots of fans who visited that website

504
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,580
who did not notice that this was a problem but as soon as it was pointed out that it was a problem

505
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:21,500
la con made damn sure it stopped being a problem and apologized for the fact that they had screwed

506
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,419
up very quickly very thoroughly very comprehensively and i think this reflects really well on la con

507
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,379
because you can't not make mistakes but the kind of convention you are comes out in how you react

508
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,399
and la con has done itself proud here i think yeah i mean i think this is right because you do kind

509
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,419
of go well how did they decide to use that theming in the first place because there's been problems

510
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,240
with Westercons in the past using that sort of theming and getting not unreasonably hammered for

511
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,780
it. So you'd have thought it would still be in the memory, but fair do. So basically, they saw the

512
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,820
problem, they sorted it out straight away, and that's great. Well done, Eloicon. So they clearly

513
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,200
have a good system for managing escalation and apology, which, you know, if you're a newly seated

514
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,579
Worldcon, I'm looking at you, Montreal, you need, is the sort of thing that you need to be setting

515
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,600
in place quite early because you never know when something's going to go wrong but something will

516
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,820
go wrong yeah i mean i don't i don't want to make it sound you know i think we're complimenting a

517
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,760
lake on on their fast reaction but you know we should be clear that they did do this and one of

518
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,400
the issues with the fact that someone reported it in a skeet is that it that is still going to spread

519
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,060
even after you have corrected the problem right like i'm sure that initial skeet probably went on

520
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,560
being re-skeeted and passed around the internet for quite some time even after the person who

521
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,140
it would have you know noted that they'd apologize because that's just how the internet happens so

522
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,120
you know you're better off not doing it but yeah well done on like very quickly taking it down

523
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,100
because i think it was down even even before the apology i think i went to look and it's like oh

524
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,680
those those bits of the page have gone no i mean you're certainly right that it would have been

525
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,840
better had it not happened and um i think you are also right that people did continue to talk about

526
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:15,640
it after it had been apologized for but i will say that like it's been a week and most people

527
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,160
have completely moved on whereas the anger over seattle has just sort of grown and grown and grown

528
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:27,080
um so i do think apologizing quickly does help but also like yeah you can't choose you also can't

529
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,240
choose how people will continue to discuss it but you can just make sure that you do all you can to

530
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,540
do the right thing it's tricky because i understand i do understand how that happened because it is

531
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:42,660
the the history of california if you are celebrating california's history um then it is very wrapped up

532
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,700
in those things so i understand how if you are focusing on that and not the cultural aspect you

533
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,860
might make this mistake but i'm glad they unmade it it is not a coincidence that british world cons

534
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:59,040
tend not to celebrate british history because ho ho there are some minefields in there better better

535
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:06,540
to avoid that uh yeah i spent some time in australia and in particular and at australian

536
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,400
historical sites where they've had to do an incredible amount of work to end up with a site

537
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:19,540
that is really respectful of all of the people involved in the in what was going on in historical

538
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,540
times and and doing it in a way that has made everybody mostly content largely content i think

539
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,560
i mean i will say and i've just checked and i was right about this that the the 2005 world con in the

540
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:35,460
uk did have an entire academic thread which was called the matter of britain about the kind of

541
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,480
portrayal of britain in science fiction fantasy yeah but twitter and facebook were both founded

542
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:45,800
after that so i mean yeah but you can obviously it can be done and it can be done carefully and well

543
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,540
but i guess the most recent ones have strayed away from that probably can be done not sure it's worth

544
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,080
The risk.

545
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,500
So, as expected, since they were the only bid,

546
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,820
the 2027 Worldcon has been awarded to Montreal.

547
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,620
They have put up some minimal information on their website,

548
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,500
including the guests of honour,

549
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,080
who are Joel Walton, Eve Maynard, Chris Barkley,

550
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,280
and they said more,

551
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,540
but I think they've already announced Jeff Jack

552
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,200
as their guest of honour.

553
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,500
That all seems good.

554
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,760
Their website is still a bit rubbish

555
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,620
and I don't know who is actually in the committee

556
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:28,880
or anything like that.

557
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,560
But they do have a website

558
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,080
and you can register for a membership.

559
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,300
And yeah, their guests of honour, I think, are pretty good.

560
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,140
You're in Montreal.

561
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:40,040
Having an author who writes in French

562
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,180
is a good thing to have.

563
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,900
I'm excited by Jo Walton.

564
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,040
She does good science fiction.

565
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,900
But I'm very excited by Geoff Jakes.

566
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,280
I think that's how you pronounce it

567
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,400
because the subtitling rendered it Jakes,

568
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,700
like J-A-K-E-S.

569
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,460
And I was initially like, who on earth?

570
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,040
And it spelt Jeff with a double F.

571
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,580
So I was like, who is Jeff Jakes?

572
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,860
And then I worked out what must have happened.

573
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,240
I've always assumed it was Jakes.

574
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,000
No, because I just don't know.

575
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,360
So maybe I assume it's Jakes then.

576
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,240
I think it's Jeff Jakes.

577
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,820
I might be wrong, but I thought it was Jeff Jakes.

578
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,200
And I don't know why I think that.

579
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,720
I've been a fan of Jeff Jakes' work for a long time.

580
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,220
I read all of Alice Grove as it was coming out and questionable content is effectively the only

581
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:30,300
webcomic that I've been reading I mean at this point I must have been reading it for over 2000

582
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:35,840
days right because I think I came in at about strip 100 and I think he's on about strip 2500 now

583
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:43,020
but I've always been a huge QC fan and so I am I'm really excited by this because QC is definitely

584
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,800
science fiction and um i think it's a really imaginative choice and a very canadian choice

585
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:55,520
so i'm i'm well i'm well enthused it's a great great pick i think we should have a sweepstakes

586
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,100
on the number of days of questionable content they have been oh is it oh no is it like 5 000

587
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:11,500
5 646 john oh so i've been reading it for how many how many years is that a long time yeah no

588
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,540
I've been reading it for 15 years, listeners.

589
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,280
About 23 days in strip time.

590
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,660
I mean, I think it's been at least a year.

591
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,340
Yeah, it has.

592
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,380
Questionable content doesn't move very fast,

593
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,500
but it has become much more science fictional lately.

594
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,300
I think early in the strip,

595
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,360
it wasn't very obvious what the SF elements were,

596
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,780
but now, of course, it is completely.

597
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,100
The main character lives with an AI, Allison.

598
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,700
Clearly science fiction.

599
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,800
Don't we all?

600
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:40,900
Don't we all?

601
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,020
I'm going to say I am also very excited about Jeff Jakes

602
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,680
and I am very excited about Joe Walton,

603
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,520
who, of course, has been a friend for a long time.

604
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,620
So that's lovely.

605
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,280
And I'm sure the other two guests are lovely too.

606
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,360
Are you excited about any of these guests, Liz?

607
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,780
Yes, but I want us to get to picks.

608
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:57,660
Sorry.

609
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,340
Liz, do you want to pick first?

610
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,300
Yes, why don't I pick first?

611
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,080
I am going to pick a book.

612
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,000
I am going to pick the book Luminous by Sylvia Park,

613
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,460
which is a debut science fiction novel.

614
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,740
It is about three siblings in Korea.

615
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,240
This is a Korea which has been unified between North and South Korea

616
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,520
and also a Korea where they have highly advanced robots,

617
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,720
which in many ways may be indistinguishable from humans, or are they not?

618
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,180
It's basically all about sibling relationships and family relationships.

619
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,880
And apparently I keep picking books about family relationships,

620
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,800
but it is also about the idea of robots and what it means to be human and what it means to be a

621
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:51,440
robot. I think it has a very nice aspect here where Jun, who is one of the siblings, is a trans man

622
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:58,920
and Jun was injured during the reunification war between North and South Korea and as part of that

623
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:06,400
has many kind of constructed parts which also act in a way as giving Jun like the body he always

624
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,680
wanted to have and so that I thought was a really interesting kind of modern twist on what is maybe

625
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:17,080
not the most maybe not the most modern of stories you know there's many many stories about you know

626
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,200
robots and humanity and what it means to be a robot but I thought it had a really good setting

627
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:27,140
and kind of definitely had some interesting aspects to it that I hadn't seen before so I enjoyed it

628
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:34,119
um I think Sylvia Park is probably a candidate for the astounding award unless they've published

629
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,380
too many short stories before which is possible but i think it's a great debut novel i really

630
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,980
enjoyed it that sounds that sounds really interesting i think that's on my big list of

631
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:49,760
things to read i suspect it will be submitted for the clark award i think so yeah has been published

632
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:56,260
in britain yeah so i will probably read it when it gets submitted yeah okay now i think i think uh

633
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:05,320
Sylvia Park has two previous short stories and so is therefore not eligible for the standing award

634
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:12,360
which unfortunately I think it's a solid choice it looks like Sylvia Park also wrote a short story

635
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:18,780
for Tor.com which is in the same uh universe so you might want to uh you can probably read that

636
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,960
oh hello what's that called so this is a 2019 story called more real than him which I think

637
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,540
you could give that a read and yet it is certainly similar to the world and the setting of the the

638
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:35,100
novels if you like that you might like the novel i'll put it in the show notes alison do you want

639
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:41,560
to do a pick i'm struggling here so a couple of weeks ago my daughter said i said to my daughter

640
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,580
what have you been doing and she was like well i've been playing a lot of slay the spire and

641
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,020
obviously i played a lot of slay the spire a long time ago but i appear to have fallen back into a

642
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,860
slay the spire hole for no particularly good reason so i'm going to pick slay the spire which i'm

643
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,700
I haven't picked before but somebody else might check for me which is an iOS game and many other

644
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,720
things game PC game Steam game everywhere game that lots of people have already played but

645
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,680
apparently it's one of those games that you can keep playing a lot even after you think you've

646
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:19,620
finished it because there's more and it is a card-based deck building roguelike so you know

647
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,840
I apparently I do these things where every so often I fall down a rabbit hole of one of these

648
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,840
and just play it until it's played out.

649
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,440
You are trying to explore a spire,

650
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,620
but really you're just hitting things and doing damage.

651
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,160
I mean, you know, stuff like that.

652
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,660
Trying not to die.

653
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,700
Dying, starting again.

654
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,360
That's not much of a pick, is it?

655
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,360
But otherwise, I've just been in Germany doing German things.

656
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,480
I don't know.

657
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,720
Continuing to be addicted to slay the spire seems good.

658
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,600
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,080
No, no, but I stopped being addicted to slay the spire

660
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,980
for months and years.

661
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:53,580
Years.

662
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,180
It's been years.

663
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,860
but apparently you could fall off the wagon and and just just you know go oh i'll just play one

664
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:04,960
game for old time's sake we had a lot of travel on thursday like our many many many hours of travel

665
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:09,160
so it was quite nice for that but the rest of the time i'm like no i could be reading new things and

666
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,900
doing new things and playing new games why am i playing old games why am i playing old games

667
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:18,180
readers write in i am going to pick a game but i'm going to pick a tabletop game

668
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,100
And I'm going to pick a game called Flick Fleet.

669
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,540
So Flick Fleet is a science fiction game.

670
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:36,760
It is published by Eurydice Games, although it is very funny to listen to a lot of people call it Eurydice Games.

671
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,600
So, yeah, and it's designed by Jackson Pope and Paul Wilcox.

672
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:48,420
I shall disclaim that I was provided with a review copy of the deluxe based game.

673
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:54,760
But I bought the first expansion with my own cash because it had asteroids.

674
00:45:55,370 --> 00:46:05,580
And so FlickFly is a game where you play the Imperium or the Uprising, which are, you know, legally distinct terms.

675
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,320
And you build lists of ships.

676
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,880
Each ship costs some points.

677
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,780
You build a list with a certain number of points.

678
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,700
And then you do battle.

679
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,500
So far, so space war game.

680
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,560
The interesting thing about Flick Fleet is that instead of rolling dice to see how well you shoot,

681
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,320
you put a dice on your ship and you flick it towards the enemy.

682
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,880
And if it hits the enemy, do damage based on what the dice rolled.

683
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,080
And the other interesting thing is that you move your ships by flicking them as well.

684
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,160
So it's a dexterity game.

685
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,960
But it's a very well thought out dexterity game.

686
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,480
It's made by a man called Paul in his garage in Leeds on his laser cutter.

687
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,980
And it's just really good.

688
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,800
It's been out for a while, but it's sort of been getting more and more kind of word of mouth and traction.

689
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,740
It's been given a must play by Tabletop Gaming Magazine.

690
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,320
And it's really interesting.

691
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,460
It's not quite like anything else I've ever played.

692
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,320
And so I do like it.

693
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,940
And you can play a game in like 20 minutes.

694
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,840
So yeah, it's really cool.

695
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,880
I highly recommend looking it up, listeners.

696
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,260
We will put a link in the show notes.

697
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,300
Sounds good.

698
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,800
So is it literally a man cutting all the bits up in his garage and posting to you?

699
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:15,300
Yeah.

700
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:15,960
Wow.

701
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,160
And each box you buy has a handwritten note from him in the lid of the box

702
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,960
saying that he hopes your battle against the Imperium goes well

703
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,940
and has a number out of the number that they made.

704
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:28,660
Oh.

705
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,620
Oh, that's great.

706
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:31,220
Yeah.

707
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,860
It's very...

708
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,440
I mean, and I will also say,

709
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,420
Even if you have no desire to ever play the game, listeners,

710
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,520
you should go and check out the box art on BoardGameGeek

711
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,440
because if you ever wanted to see Chris Foss-esque illustrations

712
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,600
of giant ghostly hands flicking dice into spaceships,

713
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,120
then the box art of this series of games is the box art for you.

714
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,440
I've often thought my life is lacking in Chris Foss-esque spaceships

715
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,180
being flicked around by giant otherworldly hands.

716
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
I do often say that, don't I, John?

717
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,500
You do. You do indeed, Liz.

718
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,860
It's one of your catchphrases.

719
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:04,380
Hmm.

720
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,340
And that was the Octothaw Podcast.

721
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,000
And it's goodbye from me.

722
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,480
It's goodbye from me.

723
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,180
And it's goodbye from me.

724
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,240
Did I ever tell you about the time that Chris and I had two dinners?

725
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,020
Has there really only been one time like that?

726
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:40,360
Yeah, I think so.

727
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,100
Chris took me for Chinese food.

728
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,820
I mean, you haven't explicitly said this, but it's not sounding particularly surprising.

729
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,700
I thought it was going to be an amusing anecdote, but you guys are just like,

730
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,580
that sounds like the sort of thing that would just happen any dinner.

731
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:53,740
And I'm like, well, fair enough.

732
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:54,540
No, no, no.

733
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,460
Any dinner involving you and Chris Garcia.

734
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,900
Therefore, it is an amusing anecdote.

735
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,000
Go on, carry on.

736
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,640
It's not.

737
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:13,880
It's just they used to be this Chinese place near Chris's old house that did like an amazing peanut oil on their dumplings, which you can sort of replicate by frying peanut butter in olive oil, but not quite.

738
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,900
But we went there for dinner and then he was like, we should go somewhere else and have steak sandwiches now.

739
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,720
And so we immediately after a full Chinese meal got in his car and drove and ate steak sandwiches.

740
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,660
And I'll be honest, that was a struggle.

741
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,920
It was a struggle I was willing to endure, but it was a struggle nonetheless.

742
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,860
Witness my hardship, listeners, and despair.

743
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:34,960
Ah, yeah.
