1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,820
Can you turn off your virtual background just because I like to see the cat?

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,780
One, two, three.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,980
Okay, that'll do.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,400
Right.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,500
John, the cat behind you, whichever one it is, like when you did the clap, the little head came up.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,760
And then they were like, oh, nothing's going on. I'll put my head back down again.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,520
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the ninth episode of the Octothorpe podcast, a podcast about science fiction and SF fandom.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,480
I'm John Coxon.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,540
I'm Alison Scott.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,840
And I'm Liz Batty.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,580
And this week we have letters of comment that have arrived since the previous episode.

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:55,600
And we actually have three letters of comment, a comment of comment and a reciprocal letter of comment, sort of.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,760
So, firstly, Helena McCallum writes in to say that you can send locks if you're not called Mark or Andrew.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,800
I like this is a sort of meta letter of comment in that it's telling us a thing and also doing that thing at the same time.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,360
So I approve.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,840
But we had, in fact, already had letters of comment from Claire.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,040
Yes, that is true.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,700
Who is not called Andrew or Mark.

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,840
But we had a lot of Marks and a lot of Andrews.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,820
I think there are now an equal number of letters of comment from people called Mark, people called Andrew and women.

21
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,740
And that may be something we want to address at some point.

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,760
Maybe we need to be diversifying our listenership.

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,740
We're like the board of directors of a company, aren't we?

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,360
Yeah.

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:47,660
Graham Charnock used to berate his female readers every episode about their inability to write letters of comment to his fanzine vibrator.

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,220
Yeah, that seems...

27
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,940
I tell you what, there are some coolest people out there in the world.

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,240
I think we will be coming on to that later.

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,700
Mark, someone called Mark, did also send us a letter of comment to keep us in letters of comment from people called Mark.

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,620
And he says that he is most disappointed that we had omitted letters of comment from people called Mark.

31
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,480
And he accuses me of having transitioned from the Mark Protection Committee to the Mark Neglection League.

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:26,040
So I would like to publicly apologise to all Marks and to admit that I have not done a good enough job of protecting their feelings and their opinions.

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,020
And I will rededicate myself to the Mark Protection Committee from this day forth.

34
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,400
Well said.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,180
He also says that he thinks I'm wrong about the Worcester's business meeting and perhaps a bare minimum business meeting is the right way to go,

36
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,680
given the state of the world at the moment and the amount of work the Con Zealand Committee are probably doing to make Con Zealand happen.

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,220
And that is a good point.

38
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,780
Yes.

39
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,920
So basically he agrees with me on that.

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,940
Yes.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,200
He says,

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,020
He says,

43
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,800
Alison and Liz,

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,940
I don't mean to neglect you,

45
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,140
but you seemed pretty clear that you're holding.

46
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,620
Dr.

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,720
Hugo Award finalist Mark neglecting the boy coxswain responsible here.

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,740
Keep on casting.

49
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,060
So props to you two.

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,400
All of the criticism directed in my direction.

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,100
Correctly.

52
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,860
Yes.

53
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,440
I mean,

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,760
I can't say it.

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,080
I can't say it's not reasonable.

56
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,060
However,

57
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,940
I had some vitriolic criticism directed this my way this fortnight from one Lillian Edwards,

58
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,080
who accused me of accused all three of us of not mentioning her new podcast.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,480
This never happens,

60
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,080
which she is doing with Christina Laker and Ian Sorenson.

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,200
And there will be a link in the show notes.

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,960
It's very good.

63
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,080
You should go and listen to it.

64
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,900
And we are not.

65
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:47,660
We are completely unapologetic about the fact that we did not mention this podcast last time because we recorded our previous episode on the 17th of June.

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,920
And she released the podcast to the world on the 18th of June.

67
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,360
So we would have to have been more than usually prescient to have mentioned it.

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,460
So Lillian,

69
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,100
tough.

70
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,280
We are mentioning it now.

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,160
Is that good enough?

72
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,780
I claim my five pounds.

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,140
I mean,

74
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:16,220
what I like about that is that you addressed her criticism with tact and kindness in a way that definitely won't stoke any fires.

75
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,400
So that's good.

76
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
Isn't stoking fires what it's all about?

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,660
It could well be.

78
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,740
It could well be.

79
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,700
So and also,

80
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,700
I think the other Mark asked us to say when we're recording and we're recording this one on Sunday,

81
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,440
the 5th of July,

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,600
and it'll go out on Wednesday,

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,320
the 8th of July.

84
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Unless it doesn't.

85
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,640
Yes.

86
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,520
All being well.

87
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,920
Unless it doesn't.

88
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
Why this podcast is not late.

89
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,760
It turns out to be easier to get podcasts out on time than fanzines,

90
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,360
which is something I had not realised.

91
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,920
I mean,

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,340
so I'm just going to say,

93
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,200
and obviously this comes from a place of love,

94
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,200
but I suspect it is also easier to get podcasts out when you have your co-host do the editing of the podcast.

95
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,220
On time.

96
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,380
On time.

97
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,580
Yes.

98
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,380
How many podcasts,

99
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,860
how many fanzines have you done,

100
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,460
Professor the Boycoxon?

101
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,320
Me?

102
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,200
A few.

103
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,780
Off the top of my head.

104
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,360
On time.

105
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,920
On time.

106
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,200
On time.

107
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,800
On time.

108
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,660
On time.

109
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,560
What is time?

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,800
Time is an illusion.

111
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,040
Fanzines doubly so.

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,100
Time is fleeting.

113
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,700
So Claire wrote us a letter of comment.

114
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,920
Claire Briarley wrote us a letter of comment to commend us for pronouncing her surname correctly,

115
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,200
and said she was going to be quieter this week also.

116
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,680
So, yes.

117
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,760
Thank you, Claire.

118
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:36,980
Please send your Clara Hughes on the topic of Claire Briarley to octothorpecast at gmail.com.

119
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,660
Oh, no.

120
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,240
That's such a terrible joke.

121
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,940
Or, in fact, any other regular correspondent.

122
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,500
Finally, two of us were at the first Thursday meeting on the first Thursday,

123
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,040
and Crazy Dave told us that he listens to this podcast at two and a half times speed.

124
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,680
So, we are curious to know whether he is the fastest podcast listener in our audience.

125
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,280
So, if you are listening at greater than two and a half times speed,

126
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,860
please write in and let us know.

127
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,340
And also tell us how on earth you managed to make sense of what's going on,

128
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,500
because I tried it.

129
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,200
I just, I know what we're saying, and I can't hear it.

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,540
So.

131
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,200
Whenever I listen to podcasts, I listen at normal speed, or sometimes 1.1,

132
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,180
but normally normal speed, because I feel that podcasts are designed to entertain,

133
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,400
and if they're not entertaining at regular speed, I'll go off and find one that is.

134
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,840
Don't tell people that.

135
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
They'll stop listening to our podcast, Alison.

136
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,820
They can listen.

137
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,520
You're very welcome to listen to this podcast.

138
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,480
It's good, though.

139
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,880
Imagine if you could listen to, like, rambling chats in the bar at 2.5 times speed.

140
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,960
There would no longer be sort of, like, four hours of rambling chat over a pint.

141
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,720
It would be like a breezy one-hour discussion.

142
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,060
Yes, and you would be taking shots of vodka to replicate.

143
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,440
I feel that Zoom has missed a trick here.

144
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,140
What, because it doesn't come with vodka?

145
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,420
No, no, Zoom needs smart speed.

146
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,120
I'm in this Zoom chat, but it's really a bit boring.

147
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,280
Let's speed it up a bit.

148
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:13,520
The details for my guff trip are all taking shape,

149
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,360
and I will be on it next time,

150
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,240
so we may have to organise when to record

151
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,580
in a way that ties in with my virtually swimming off the Great Barrier Reef

152
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,540
or something like that.

153
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,040
I've got lots of plans to go spend time in bars

154
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,800
with people who are not required to social distance,

155
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,520
though I don't know to what extent things are really back to normal

156
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,580
in Australia and New Zealand.

157
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,920
I think they are more back to normal, except in Melbourne,

158
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,660
which is one of the main places I'm going,

159
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,900
which has had another outbreak,

160
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,460
so who knows what's going to happen.

161
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,360
And anyway, so you will get my next report from not Australia,

162
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,620
but virtually Australia.

163
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,920
And I will tell you all about the exciting things I'm doing there

164
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,760
as part of the first part of reporting on a virtual guff trip.

165
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,020
So when does your virtual guff trip begin, Alison?

166
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,900
It starts on the 11th, which is really not very long.

167
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,960
Oh, wow, less than a week.

168
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,360
I've got, yeah, less than a week.

169
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,340
And normally I'd be like panicking and packing at this point,

170
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,420
but in fact I'm actually doing all the stuff I didn't get around to earlier

171
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,560
because as it's virtual it's easier, I hope, to get it all sorted.

172
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,600
Fair enough.

173
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,320
And on your, so when, so you're starting on the 11th,

174
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,760
when does your virtual trip come to a close?

175
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Well, I'm, I finish with Con Zealand and then I will be not flying home.

176
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,060
And I think that's, that's the time we actually have to sort out a recording

177
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,200
because I think I'm, I'm going to not stay with Liz on my way home

178
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,700
and we're going to not, we're going to record Octothorpe

179
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,320
as if I was in Liz's living room.

180
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,600
So that won't be the next one.

181
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
It'll be the one after, I think, after Con Zealand.

182
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,660
And you'll be going, how, what was your,

183
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,600
what were your impressions of virtual Con Zealand?

184
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,340
And I'll be going, I am completely knackered and my eyes are square now.

185
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,800
Yes, that's fair.

186
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:15,160
So there will be more firm details about our live from Alison's trip home recording

187
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,980
in the next episode.

188
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,280
So keep your eyes peeled for that.

189
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,560
Shall we talk about Con Zealand?

190
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,080
We often do, but yes, let's do it again.

191
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,320
I saw a tweet several weeks ago, which I have now lost,

192
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,780
but it was that Con Zealand were looking for people to help with access

193
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,240
and specifically the issues of access,

194
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,700
which would come up when you are a virtual convention,

195
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,880
which I think is quite interesting because it feels like we're starting to get a handle

196
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,620
on what conventions can do to make themselves more accessible to people who are actually at the convention.

197
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,140
But obviously moving online is going to bring a whole new set of issues.

198
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,820
And I'd be interested to know if you have any thoughts on them,

199
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,580
if you've been to any virtual conventions or meetups,

200
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,980
which did think about ways to make them more accessible to people who find it difficult

201
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,260
to access virtual conventions.

202
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,580
And any other thoughts on the matter?

203
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,900
Well, it's funny you should say this.

204
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,920
So I've been doing First Thursday meetups for London fans.

205
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:30,140
When we started, we very quickly noticed that we were getting quite a lot of people attending

206
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,360
who could not attend the first Thursday in person,

207
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,680
sometimes for reasons of distance,

208
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:46,940
which is not actually a primary accessibility issue for what we think of as being a local London pub meeting.

209
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,840
So it's nice that these people can now come,

210
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,400
but it's not what I think of as the most important accessibility issue for the thing.

211
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,800
But we also have had people visiting who cannot normally attend the meeting,

212
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,580
either because they do not like crowded pubs or they cannot get up the stairs.

213
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,480
And so that is so having those people there is very welcome.

214
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,000
We have then since then been trying to do outreach.

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,360
And we've done this on a very individual basis.

216
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,920
And we are and we've done outreach to the people who we know normally attend the first Thursday meetings,

217
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,100
but have not been attending the Zoom meetings.

218
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,240
We've had a range of responses.

219
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,600
So some of them have come and tried it and some of them quite like it.

220
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,000
Some of them have tried Zoom,

221
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,520
but concluded that they don't like large Zooms,

222
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,740
even if we do the breakout room thing,

223
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,900
that they are preferring their,

224
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,280
even though they might quite enjoy conventions,

225
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,240
they are preferring to do the interactive meetups in smaller groups.

226
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,220
Some people are still struggling with the technology.

227
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:56,080
People who are deaf are highly disenfranchised from most of this virtual life that we are living now.

228
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,820
It is much worse than a regular pub meeting would be.

229
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,740
And often also than the formal panels and presentations at conventions.

230
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,000
They are finding it harder.

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,580
It is harder to lip read.

232
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,400
It is harder to manage the complexity of conversation where several people are in a room.

233
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,440
And that's about all I have on it.

234
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,740
So some people don't like Zoom.

235
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,340
Some people can't manage Zoom.

236
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:28,260
Some people have disabilities that are more or differently disabling in a Zoom environment.

237
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,780
But, you know, it's something that we've given some thought to.

238
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,140
And actually, for a lot of the older people,

239
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:40,440
just helping them individually get into this way of working is the thing that's most useful.

240
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,200
So, yeah.

241
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:51,820
So the thing that popped into my head immediately was the problem that you'd have if you were hard of hearing with this kind of technology.

242
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:01,520
And I think one of the reasons I got quite annoyed at the Hugo ceremony in Dublin because they had the automatic subtitles.

243
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,400
People were laughing when they got it wrong.

244
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:13,700
But the problem with that is that it means that they said, oh, we should not have used automatic subtitles because they were inviting people to find them funny.

245
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,840
And I kind of thought that maybe when we see automatic subtitles that are inadvertently saying the wrong things,

246
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,180
we need to shut the hell up and remember that these subtitles are there as an accessibility feature for deaf people

247
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:33,760
and not laugh in a way that means that convention committees want to take that away for the deaf community.

248
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,100
So my thought, Susan, is that one, you are quite right that if we see something on automatic subtitles,

249
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,620
we do need to remember, look, these are here for a purpose.

250
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,740
It's there to help people.

251
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,880
And we shouldn't, you know, we should try not to react in that way because it's not helpful.

252
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:57,560
And that I can see that when you're doing an all online convention, there are auto subtitling options that might help.

253
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:06,420
But my second thought is that for big events like the Hugos, you should really be paying for a live captioner because these problems will not happen.

254
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,940
And we know that is possible.

255
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,260
It takes money, but it doesn't take enormous, vast amounts of money that WorldCom's cannot allocate to it.

256
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,540
And that would have solved that particular problem.

257
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,280
I think in smaller groups, that is less of a problem because I think the problem with the Hugos is one person finds it a bit funny

258
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,380
and then everyone around them starts to realise what they're laughing about and that spreads.

259
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,840
So maybe that's not a problem if it's only 30 people watching live captioning of a panel or so on.

260
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:44,220
But I was slightly surprised that they used the auto subtitling option for the Hugos instead of going with a person in the auditorium or elsewhere doing it for them.

261
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,260
That's fair.

262
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,500
I think that's a good point.

263
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,960
I think that's less relevant to a virtual thing because the people who need automatic subtitling will use it.

264
00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:10,140
I also feel that laughing at automatic subtitling is the equivalent of laughing at a presenter whose first language is not English or who has a spasticity that means that they can't form words or move in a normal way.

265
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:40,120
And it's completely reprehensible.

266
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,600
communicating.

267
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:48,040
You're clearly laughing at someone who has feelings, whereas laughing at an automatic transcription doesn't have a victim in quite the way.

268
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,880
It doesn't have as obvious a victim.

269
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,200
And so I think it is much easier to laugh at that because it doesn't feel like you're being cruel.

270
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,200
So I see why people might laugh at one and not the other.

271
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:11,100
But yeah, I think Liz's point about the Hugos, especially being able to afford a person to do it, which would not necessarily run into the same problems.

272
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:19,700
Especially as award ceremonies often have a lot of text, which is pre-written and can just be spewed out.

273
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,980
You don't have to live caption anything except the acceptance speeches.

274
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,480
Yes, and it means you can send them the names of all the finalists in advance.

275
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,760
They could have put that into the automatic transcription software too, just saying.

276
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,240
I actually had another subsidiary point about the other thing Alison said.

277
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:53,500
I was just going to say that obviously the first Thursday mechanism of individually contacting members who are having trouble and helping them in a one-to-one setting scales poorly to Worldcon levels of attendance.

278
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,420
OK, here's how you do it.

279
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:13,440
You ask people to talk to their friends who are having trouble and you also encourage local things like the first Thursday to happen because if those things are happening in lots of different places, that is a way to preload lots of people.

280
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,660
So you encourage the grassroots activity that's required.

281
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:26,220
In fact, Con Zealand, I think, are doing training sessions to get people familiar with their platforms before the con, which I think is a great way of doing it.

282
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,420
And that is also going to open up access.

283
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,360
So you can log in.

284
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,920
You'll be able to log in, I think, to their Discord and things and check them out ahead of time to make sure your chosen device is going to work nicely with everything.

285
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,840
And so you don't spend the first day of your convention trying to fiddle with Zoom, I guess.

286
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,640
Have they announced this?

287
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,200
Or have they just, is this just one of these, we are intending to do this stuff?

288
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,260
Because I've just, I finally got around to filling in my programme participant form.

289
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,440
Sorry, Jenny.

290
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,920
You had sent it to me and I am just terrible.

291
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,740
You are the bane of programme.

292
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,400
You are the bane of programme heads everywhere, Alison.

293
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,040
And it has a thing saying, would you like to moderate a panel?

294
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:12,640
And I said, if you insist, because I know that although I'm not the world's best moderator, there's always a shortage of female moderators.

295
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,000
And I think that it is better to have less good female moderators than better male moderators.

296
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Controversial opinion.

297
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,860
And so and then they said, would you be happy to attend a training session?

298
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,120
And I was kind of like, yes, of course.

299
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,280
But they do have to fit that training session in around my virtual guff trip.

300
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,860
And so time is getting tight.

301
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,240
Tighter than usual, I feel, for the Worldcon.

302
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,880
There are a few things where I'm kind of like, oh, you're cutting it a bit fine now.

303
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,920
I thought they had said this, but now I mention it.

304
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,900
Of course, I cannot actually find any of the information on it.

305
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,100
Or did they email it to me?

306
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,680
That might be it.

307
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,740
It is interesting.

308
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,800
Since we have started podcasting, I have become much more interested in conventions, official lines of communication,

309
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,580
because that is how I try and find out what conventions are doing.

310
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,580
And so whenever there is something I know about a convention that is not in their official line of communication,

311
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,960
I'm like, why have you not put this on your website in a place that it is easy to find?

312
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:19,520
Conventions often put quite a lot of control over their official communication routes in a way that makes it hard for, say,

313
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,820
area heads to actually get in there and amend the things for their own area rapidly.

314
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:32,840
So you can often have area heads who are very happy to keep the information for their area up to date,

315
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,400
who are prevented from doing so by the broader controls over what goes on the website.

316
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,400
And it is not a stupid thing to do.

317
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,180
There are arguments on both sides of this.

318
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,120
But my view is that if you trust somebody to be an area head,

319
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,520
you should probably trust them to update their web page too.

320
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,980
I have now found the announcement and it was in my email.

321
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,080
And it probably says something about me that I immediately tried to find it on Facebook and Twitter

322
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,100
and their official page before I just went and read the email, which I read this afternoon.

323
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:08,120
But yes, it does say you can ask if there's a form to fill in if you would like to have some live training on Discord,

324
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,540
which I think is a great initiative.

325
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,440
I think it is a great initiative.

326
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,080
I will point out that anyone who has not joined New Zealand because they feel they cannot use the technology

327
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,820
is perhaps in need of this being announced more widely than emails to people who have joined God Zealand.

328
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,860
I'm not technically a God Zealand member.

329
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,880
I'm just on their mailing list of people who have expressed interest at some point.

330
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,140
So it maybe is going to a wider group there.

331
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,340
Yeah, and point well taken.

332
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,820
Actually, interestingly, as a Con Zealand member, I did not get this email.

333
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:53,380
So, you know, I think that all of these things make sense in terms of how Worldcon divisions are put together.

334
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,780
And they are all volunteers doing these jobs.

335
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,480
And like it all I completely see how all of this has happened.

336
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:06,480
But I do think at some point there needs to be a little bit of a thought about whether or not these are sensible structures

337
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,940
and whether or not there is a better way to structure these things.

338
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:16,360
I realise that as someone who is identifying this problem and not volunteering for a Worldcon,

339
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,560
not that I'm definitely part of the precipitate in this regard in that I am not part of the solution.

340
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,320
But.

341
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,300
Shall we talk about Hugo voting?

342
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,980
Yeah, it hasn't started yet.

343
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:39,420
I have had informal conversations with people who may not may or may not be connected with the people who have to actually count up the Hugos who are like,

344
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,040
we think the time is now getting quite tight for for the management of the Hugo voting.

345
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:51,340
So this is my question, because I well, I agree that the time is getting very tight for the Hugo voting since it is not open yet.

346
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,800
And they're going to present them at the end of the month.

347
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:03,700
But also, I do not know how many people actually vote throughout the voting process and how many people try and log in 10 minutes before the end of voting and frantically vote for everything.

348
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,700
So I don't know whether this delay will actually be, you know,

349
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,560
lowering the number of Hugo votes or just compressing everything into a two week window when it would probably be compressed into anyway.

350
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,020
This is this is my question, because when people were discussing this, I was like,

351
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:28,340
I can see that having fewer votes is a problem, but it was less clear to me whether or not this would end up in there being less votes, if that makes sense.

352
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,240
So, yeah, I completely see your point.

353
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:40,860
It also prevents you from doing neat little things like having the best Hugo, best novel Hugo presented by a female astronaut and other tricks like this.

354
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,640
It's quite useful to have the Hugos in the bag well before the World Cup.

355
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:55,140
It used to be that this would have been completely impossible because the process of Hugo voting involved a voting phase and then a counting phase that was long and extremely complicated.

356
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:02,760
And I believe that now that we have very few postal votes, the counting phase is very quick.

357
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,520
But people are still entitled to vote by post and they cannot do that.

358
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,740
So they can.

359
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,900
They can.

360
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,740
The paper ballots have been up since the nominees were announced.

361
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,940
It is only the online voting that is not available.

362
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,460
Sorry that that ruins the rant.

363
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,880
In that case, ignore me.

364
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,760
I'm talking rot, but it's still impossible because you can't actually post anything to New Zealand with any confidence it will arrive at the moment.

365
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,440
So, you know.

366
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,320
Oh, yeah.

367
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,380
I do.

368
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:39,060
I do sort of think that if you're casting a postal vote across the Pacific Ocean during COVID-19, that may not be the most reliable mechanism.

369
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,460
But yes.

370
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:48,040
I like that COVID-19 is quite like the 2019 Hugos and that it's voted and awarded in 2020.

371
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,680
Tim, this is an interesting, this is an ecumenical matter.

372
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,940
The 2020 Hugos are awarded in 2020 for works in 2019.

373
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,960
That's right.

374
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,400
Sorry, these things vary quite a lot.

375
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,100
I think it's the 2019 Oscars, isn't it?

376
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,360
I never know these things.

377
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,860
Everyone does it differently.

378
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,040
There is no consensus.

379
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:15,440
It is quite interesting in that it is clear that they will get it together, we think.

380
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,580
But if they don't get it together, it's going to be spectacular.

381
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,880
I think there's quite a big risk that they get it together in between when we record this and when the show is released.

382
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,920
So, well done, guys.

383
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,900
That was well-timed to mess up our podcast.

384
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,220
They have announced that voting will open no later than Wednesday, the 8th of July.

385
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,260
So, it should be open by the time this podcast is released.

386
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,900
I'm not sure it's going to be a problem in practice because I don't think really you need a voting period that's longer than a week.

387
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,700
It'll be fine.

388
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,200
They'll award the Hugos.

389
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,520
I do feel a bit sorry for the guys who have to engrave the names on the bases as well.

390
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,460
But they're probably used to this sort of thing.

391
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,800
But that's actually fine because all the Hugos will be being shipped around the world.

392
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,920
And so, they don't necessarily have to be ready and engraved on the day of the Hugo ceremony.

393
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:11,180
The introduction of the E Pluribus Hugo, let's make the Hugo voting quite complicated amendment,

394
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:19,220
also means that you absolutely have to do the whole thing digitally anyway and have software that you've run seven or eight times to check it actually works.

395
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:26,160
So, I assume that when you just close Hugo voting and then you push a button and then ten minutes later you have the results.

396
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,540
But maybe that's hopefully optimistic.

397
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,720
Fingers crossed.

398
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:36,760
That also perceivably means that the paper votes are transmitted, are data entried into the digital system.

399
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,380
I'm pretty sure.

400
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:44,780
That's certainly how I would do it if I were a group of Hugo administrators.

401
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,220
And that is not in any way a job application, guys.

402
00:25:47,940 --> 00:26:01,340
I've now listened to all the best fancasts so that I can write an article for the Glasgow 2024 bid is running some articles on Hugo slates.

403
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,920
And one of them is best fancast and I'm writing about it.

404
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,080
So, we can talk about that next time if you like.

405
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,560
A crossover.

406
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,700
But I will be plugging this podcast there, obviously.

407
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,500
And I can plug Glasgow 2024.

408
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,120
They're going to be a great convention.

409
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,060
Glasgow is a wonderful place to go to for the Worldcon.

410
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,000
You should vote for them.

411
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,240
Does that mean I should listen to all the best fancasts?

412
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,000
At 2.5 speed, obviously.

413
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:35,020
Yes, it does make me laugh that next episode will be the only episode we record other than this one before the close of voting.

414
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,780
So, we gave an hour to Best Dramatical Log Form.

415
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:46,320
And then we're going to give an hour to all other Hugo categories, which is...

416
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,620
Yes, that's our topic for next time.

417
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,160
All the Hugos in an hour.

418
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,760
Starting from here.

419
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,240
Yeah.

420
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,460
All of them.

421
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:54,940
All of them.

422
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,960
We could probably do it.

423
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,520
We just do like a minute per category instead of a minute per finalist.

424
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,420
Or we could have like an extra...

425
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,240
Or we could have an extra long episode where we talk about all of the categories.

426
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,700
And people have to...

427
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,200
And Crazy Dave has to run it at 4.6 speed.

428
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,240
How much of our, like, Star Wars, Marvel debate did you cut out of that episode, John?

429
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,080
Because if you think about it...

430
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,380
I don't think the rest will be as contentious.

431
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,260
I think we all agree.

432
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,040
No, I'm not going to start the argument.

433
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,980
If you can find a topic on which we all agree we have failed in our podcast setting up arrangements.

434
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:42,640
The other thing we need to talk about with regard to New Zealand is the colonised, marginalised and historically underrepresented people inclusion initiative, which Liz knows about.

435
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:51,940
So Con Zealand had a previous scholarship, which was for people from marginalised communities to attend Con Zealand in person.

436
00:27:51,940 --> 00:28:01,660
And so it was aimed at people who were in New Zealand, particularly those who identified as Maori, Pacifica, people of Kura, LGBTQI or disabled.

437
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:11,260
And I'm wondering if this is now an initiative to expand that, given that they're now an online convention where you don't need to be there in person.

438
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:21,100
So presumably adding people to the virtual convention is less of an issue because you don't have limits on your venue capacity.

439
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,960
And also your kind of marginal costs are minimal.

440
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,720
It's just kind of expanding your online activities and making sure you have the people support for them.

441
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:46,980
And so they have a new membership upgrade initiative to support the inclusion of colonised, marginalised and historically underrepresented people at Wellcome, which I think is great because that will hopefully allow a lot more people to attend virtually from a lot more different places.

442
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,300
Even more so than when it was actually going to be physically in New Zealand.

443
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,980
So I think this is a great initiative.

444
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,860
It sounds like a good initiative.

445
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:03,660
Like, obviously, I think inclusion in conventions is a thing that is really important.

446
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,500
And we've talked before about how virtual conventions can be a way to achieve that.

447
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:15,200
And it sounds like this initiative is kind of putting that into practice in a way, which I think is really good.

448
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,740
It's pretty exciting, actually.

449
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:32,380
And as I've had numerous conversations with people who are unable to attend Con Zealand because of the cost of doing it, some of those people are marginalised or from groups that will probably be represented by this.

450
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,260
And we should put a link in the show notes and we should also let everyone know that it's happening because this might be you.

451
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,160
Is there a deadline for applying for these scholarships?

452
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,600
Nope.

453
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,660
They're going to say at least weekly as long as upgrades last.

454
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,960
I don't know how long upgrades last, but there you go.

455
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:59,580
Recently, there has been a new wave of stories concerning abuse and harassment in the community.

456
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,820
And a common thread between many of these is the need to be aware of two factors.

457
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:11,040
Firstly, the power dynamic that can exist between more established and less established members of the community.

458
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:17,380
And secondly, the fact that conventions are professional environments for professional members of the community.

459
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,720
And there needs to be more awareness of that.

460
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:27,640
So this has been on Twitter, I think, mostly, although obviously it has bled into other discussion venues.

461
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:37,700
And I don't think we're going to try and link to much because it's very widely distributed and it's very difficult to keep track of.

462
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,240
But we have thoughts.

463
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:47,480
I thought this was interesting because I don't have this mindset of thinking about conventions as professional spaces,

464
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,820
because for me, the conventions are not professional spaces.

465
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:55,520
And I do have, you know, I do, there are professional spaces that I go into that are conferences in my own field.

466
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,280
And for me, they feel sufficiently different from science fiction conventions that I don't really think of conventions in that professional way.

467
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,420
And so I've been thinking about where this might give me blind spots.

468
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,580
In particular, I think because I don't think of them as being professional events for me,

469
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,680
I don't think of myself as really having any power in them.

470
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:25,420
When maybe I should, because if I am, say, working on program convention and I have a lot of power over who does and who doesn't get slots for panels,

471
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,300
slots for readings, slots for cafe clutches,

472
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:34,820
how much am I projecting my own biases on there and kind of rewarding professional names I know

473
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,200
and not rewarding professional names I don't know?

474
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,320
Things like that.

475
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,360
Is what I think of as just being a hobby of setting these things up,

476
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,520
actually something which can make a difference to maybe to the careers of quite junior people

477
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:55,840
who would really like the platform that they can get at a convention to try and develop their professional careers.

478
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:03,240
And also in that a lot of the issues that have been talked about seem to involve interactions in convention bars.

479
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:12,940
This gets us back to the, I think, well discussed previously problem that a lot of interaction does take places in bars and in particular places with alcohol consumption,

480
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,440
which obviously is fun for a lot of us,

481
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:26,280
but may lead to extra problems of how do you keep things professional if you are drinking in the bar with people who may have the power to help or hinder your career.

482
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,080
That seems remarkably reasonable.

483
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,940
I think I want to go slightly further.

484
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,900
Obviously conventions are for some people a professional space.

485
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,020
They are not, I think, primarily a professional space.

486
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,480
I think we would probably most say that the most, most of us would agree that the most successful conventions,

487
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:55,560
certainly the most successful larger conventions, are a weird hybrid between personal and professional space in that,

488
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:01,920
although they were originally set up by fans as a way to spend social time,

489
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:08,980
and they are almost exclusively run by fans volunteering to do the organising.

490
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:15,740
It is certainly true that professionals who are attending the convention professionally enhance the convention in many ways.

491
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,780
And as I've just kind of started in a tiny little way,

492
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,580
attending conventions professionally as well as personally,

493
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,680
that I do feel that kind of strange,

494
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,400
the edge of, well,

495
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,840
I would do this,

496
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,880
but I will not do this because it is a,

497
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,680
it is a professional barrier for me.

498
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,780
Or here is this thing that I can,

499
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,700
I may be able to provide a professional service to a convention,

500
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,780
but is it right for me to provide a professional service to that convention?

501
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,860
While I am also a fan attending the convention.

502
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:56,360
I feel that it is not reasonable to expect everybody in a convention bar in the evening to behave as if they were at a professional event.

503
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:56,800
And,

504
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,820
and you would not necessarily want that to happen.

505
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:08,940
I think that I've seen some calls for alcohol and bars at conventions to be banned or relegated.

506
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,280
And I,

507
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,260
I do feel that,

508
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:16,760
that those people are missing the point or certainly the point for me,

509
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,520
because I am,

510
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,840
although I do do some professional work at cons,

511
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,040
I am primarily there to have fun with my mates.

512
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:39,020
I feel that at least one of the stories that I've read has arisen out of somebody believing that they were engaging in a professional relationship where it's quite possible that the other people involved in this primarily saw the relationship as a personal relationship.

513
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,020
one that didn't contain a professional component.

514
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,600
And I think there is the issue,

515
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,660
the one where the issue of how much power as a,

516
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,800
as a,

517
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,220
and a very established writer or indeed even as a quote,

518
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,020
big name fan.

519
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,020
I am putting big name fan in actual scarecoats because these things do not actually exist.

520
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,120
And,

521
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,160
and it has always been a joke,

522
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,960
I think,

523
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,060
except obviously it isn't a joke in some ways.

524
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,340
So,

525
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:07,020
and whether people like that do have more power than they realize.

526
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,160
You say about big name fans being a joke and,

527
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,380
and,

528
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,000
and I see where you're coming from.

529
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,240
I,

530
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,340
I don't feel,

531
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,240
um,

532
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,060
I don't feel that the fact that I have been in fandom for longer than some people gives me any power,

533
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,280
but it might be that that's because I haven't thought properly about it.

534
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,240
What?

535
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,720
Professor Hugo nominated,

536
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,660
Mark Protector or Neglector,

537
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,440
um,

538
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,340
the boy,

539
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,380
um,

540
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,160
major podcast editor,

541
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,440
the coxswain,

542
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:36,820
yes.

543
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,580
This,

544
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,760
this neatly encapsulates the problem,

545
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,300
which is if you asked me,

546
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,360
are you powerful?

547
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,660
I would probably not immediately rush to say yes.

548
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:52,580
And I think that means that I haven't thought properly about it because I think I do have a,

549
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,300
I,

550
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,500
I am obviously acutely aware of many of my axes of privilege.

551
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,120
Um,

552
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,680
but I think that is an axis of privilege.

553
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,200
I have not properly thought about,

554
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,260
and I think the problem with saying,

555
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,440
oh,

556
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:03,660
you know,

557
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,520
there's not really any such thing as a big name fan.

558
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:05,780
Like,

559
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,840
I do completely understand where you're coming from,

560
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:14,120
but I do wonder whether that is because we don't properly think about how those power dynamics are actually,

561
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,960
um,

562
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,240
in effect in fandom.

563
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,160
Um,

564
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,720
because I think if you meet someone,

565
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,320
I remember the first time,

566
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,740
you know,

567
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,300
meeting some fans I'd only heard about,

568
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,820
you do.

569
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,740
I remember being scared to meet Greg Pickersgill.

570
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,480
You were right.

571
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,160
I'm not necessarily saying he is powerful.

572
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,240
Uh,

573
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,060
but in some ways he definitely is.

574
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,600
He had a power over me when I was a new fan.

575
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,640
And it's also very easy for me to forget that I've been in fandom for 15 years now.

576
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,720
So I'm not new anymore.

577
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:47,780
And I think it's double easy to forget that because there are people who have been in fandom a lot longer than me who think I am still new.

578
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,080
So these are all really interesting,

579
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,260
um,

580
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,340
overlapping power dynamics,

581
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,060
which are,

582
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,800
I think,

583
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,700
quite easy not to think about.

584
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,620
which is bad.

585
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,180
But,

586
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,460
you know,

587
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,700
but there are people there,

588
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,680
but there are people,

589
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,720
there are quite a lot of people at the Eastercon who are not very established in their careers,

590
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,160
who believe very strongly that it's very important to be there.

591
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,040
And I've been on panels with people who I,

592
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,660
I think were very introverted writers who almost certainly write very well,

593
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,640
but who,

594
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,520
who honestly,

595
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,100
I think would rather have been in a bucket of,

596
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:31,940
of live crabs for an hour than on an Eastercon panel having to say things about things.

597
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,960
And I did feel very sorry for these people.

598
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,860
And then again,

599
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,640
who felt that that was part of professional development for a writer.

600
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,560
Yes.

601
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:39,820
I mean,

602
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:45,780
what I would hope actually is that going to Eastercons and other conventions is fun,

603
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,680
but I would like it if it didn't have that much impact on careers.

604
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,460
Yes,

605
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,240
I would agree with that.

606
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,720
Because I do think it,

607
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,360
I think it,

608
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,380
it is advantageous that underrepresented people even further,

609
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:03,840
because they're not the people who may feel that they are able or feel safe in going into a convention bar and,

610
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,260
you know,

611
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,400
having a few pints and trying to schmooze with publishing professionals.

612
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,640
Because also,

613
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,480
as we've seen,

614
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:18,380
it's those people who are taking the bulk of the harassment in situations where it does go wrong.

615
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,560
And it is not all kind of nice fun and games.

616
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,640
And there are power imbalances.

617
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,400
And the question there is whether the harassment,

618
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,520
not necessarily harassment,

619
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,760
but whether the unfortunate,

620
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:33,720
some of the unfortunate outcomes arise from a situation where people who are marginalized to begin with,

621
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:41,740
feel that they have to go outside their comfort zone in order to gain acceptance in the community.

622
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,340
And as a result,

623
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:49,120
do things that they probably wouldn't do if they weren't doing them for professional reasons.

624
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,080
And at that point,

625
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,180
you're into a very difficult situation,

626
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,820
very difficult situations that,

627
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,440
you know,

628
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,880
as we know from other industries,

629
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,740
lead to terrible abuses.

630
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,020
I think it's,

631
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:08,060
we should be clear that convention should be aware of the potential for problems and try and have good codes of conduct,

632
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:12,720
good harassment policies and things to try and mitigate against all these problems.

633
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:20,760
And obviously listener services and systems so that people who are finding something is amiss.

634
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,800
But at least one of these things that's come out,

635
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,760
the incident may happen now,

636
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:35,140
and it may only be years down the line that the ramifications of that come to light.

637
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,480
I think that's the sort of thing.

638
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,960
And there's only so much that conventions can do there.

639
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,660
You know,

640
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,480
if you're in a position of power,

641
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,820
try not to abuse it.

642
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,560
Try to realize that the person may be talking to you,

643
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,680
not because they like you and think you're marvelous,

644
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,880
but because they think you may be able to help their career and act accordingly.

645
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,380
That has been the ninth episode of Octothorpe.

646
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,100
Thank you very much for listening.

647
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,780
And it is goodbye from me.

648
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,320
It's goodbye from me.

649
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,860
And it's goodbye from me.

650
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:09,780

So, before we leave you,

653
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,040
we're going to talk a little bit about staying sane in the apocalypse.

654
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,780
So, Alison, what have you been doing to stay sane in the apocalypse?

655
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,440
The country seems to have decided that we all have to go out to pubs and restaurants,

656
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,740
and I have not been doing that,

657
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,800
but I have come to visit my parents,

658
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,720
which is legal as of yesterday.

659
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,520
So, we're here for two nights, which I believe is allowed within the law.

660
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,200
And, obviously, they are getting on,

661
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,980
so it's quite nice to be able to come up and help them with symptoms,

662
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,840
most of which involve operating systems.

663
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,460
And I feel like it's back to being...

664
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,040
It's the first time I've felt that I've done anything

665
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,640
that's felt like my normal life for months on end.

666
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,580
So, that's quite nice.

667
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,080
But I still think, in general,

668
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,800
I'm not that sane,

669
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,360
and we are still in an apocalypse.

670
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,700
Oh, and greetings to all our American listeners,

671
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,860
who are really just kind of at the beginning of an apocalypse right now.

672
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,280
So, I'm very worried for America.

673
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,140
I mean, I think we're actually in several apocalypses simultaneously,

674
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,600
but there is one main one.

675
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,260
But, personally, this week, I went to work for two days.

676
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,640
I worked from a coffee shop one day

677
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,420
because all the power was going off

678
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,760
for the annual electrical check in my apartment,

679
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,980
and I forgot about this until the air conditioning went off one morning.

680
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,100
I have also been to a bar,

681
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,280
although all the bars here are already, like, table service

682
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,580
and someone brings you your drinks.

683
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,160
So, I did not, like, have to go and cram up at the bar

684
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,540
trying to retrieve my pints.

685
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,340
They bring them to you.

686
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,280
It's all very civilised.

687
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,820
So, it does feel more like I am doing the normal, everyday things

688
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,320
I would do than before,

689
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,380
but I am doing them all while wearing a mask.

690
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,480
So, that's obviously a kind of reminder of what's going on.

691
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,520
Oh, my other thing is that

692
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,260
I happened to be reading the anthology

693
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,000
New Suns, original speculative fiction by people of colour,

694
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,460
edited by Nisi Scholl.

695
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,400
I happened to be reading that this week

696
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,520
and it is very good.

697
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,720
It's not a themed anthology.

698
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,780
It's just an anthology of, like, excellent speculative fiction

699
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,780
and it's got a very high hit rate for me.

700
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,020
And while I was reading it,

701
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,880
I happened to win the Locus Award for Best Anthology.

702
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,500
So, you should go out and get that.

703
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,640
I have this day, say, in the apocalypse

704
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,780
by, it will not surprise anyone to learn,

705
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,140
playing board games.

706
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:49,460
I recently discovered the joys of print and play board games.

707
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,340
I have found a website called docsdirect.com.

708
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,700
You could put your beautiful game cards in the show notes, John,

709
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,640
because they really are a thing of beauty.

710
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,220
I was very impressed.

711
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:07,800
I purchased several 300 GSM satin prints

712
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,960
of various board game print and play stuff

713
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,580
and I bought a corner cutter,

714
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,480
which makes square corners round

715
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,280
and I got my craft knife and my,

716
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,220
I was about to say cutting board,

717
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,340
but I actually use a cardboard envelope

718
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,240
because I am pro.

719
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,340
And I got on with it

720
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,560
and now I have print-to-play board games to play.

721
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,720
Even more board games.

722
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,520
Also went to Ikea.

723
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,700
Ikea's still there.

724
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,720
Had to queue to get in.

725
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,660
Wasn't that bad.

726
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,300
Social distancing was fine.

727
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,900
Mostly very good.

728
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,840
Well, Ikea's always had you go all the way around the shop

729
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,240
on a one-way system, hasn't it?

730
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,000
Yes.

731
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,400
Actually, this is one of the things that really made it difficult,

732
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,040
which is the bit immediately upon getting in was very crowded,

733
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,860
but as soon as you got through that bit, it was all fine.

734
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,240
And the other thing is that my parents are coming to visit next week,

735
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,580
which I'm very much looking forward to.

736
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,740
They're staying in a hotel.

737
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,620
They're not staying with us because our house is small enough

738
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:06,540
that it might be difficult to do social distancing in our house.

739
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,900
But yes, looking forward to that very much.

740
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,640
Hurrah for people.

741
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,580
I haven't seen people in so long.

742
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,980
I'm still not going as far as going to Ikea.

743
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,920
Ikea can still bring stuff to me in a truck, as far as I'm concerned.

744
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,120
Yeah, I'm only going into shops when it's absolutely essential,

745
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,000
which means when they sell almond croissants.

746
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,520
That's fair.

747
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,460
No, I mean, so I would have gotten...

748
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,340
We have been mostly getting delivery, I will say.

749
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,420
The problem is that Ikea's delivery is not priced.

750
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,860
If you're just buying a couple of odd lens for your bathroom,

751
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,940
the delivery costs are exorbitant.

752
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,540
If we had been getting several bits of furniture,

753
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,680
I probably would have done that,

754
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,200
but I just needed a toilet roll holder and a mirror

755
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,460
and other things like that.

756
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,820
So, yeah.

757
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,440
It's a good point,

758
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,540
because Ikea here will deliver minor bits and pieces

759
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,720
for about three quid.

760
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,800
Yeah, they just put them in the post.

761
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,520
I've certainly got odd things delivered from Ikea without...

762
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,580
I think there was one thing we tried

763
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,560
that they wanted to deliver for the full whack.

764
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,860
That's the problem.

765
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,960
It's if you're bigger than whatever could go...

766
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,800
It'll have been your towel rail or something.

767
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,820
Yeah, or, like, it might have been the bin.

768
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,420
Oh, yeah, bins will get you.

769
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,160
The bin might have been too big.

770
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,080
But, yeah, like, it was fine.

771
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,040
I wore my mask.

772
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,140
I walked.

773
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,780
Didn't use public transport.

774
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,240
So, yeah, it was fine.

775
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,540
I am not symptomatic.

776
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,300
Oh, and I'm taking part in a University of Southampton,

777
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,640
Southampton NHS,

778
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,720
COVID-19 testing pilot program,

779
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,800
where I spit in a small vial,

780
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,480
and they tell me if I have coronavirus.

781
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,140
They don't tell me if I have had coronavirus.

782
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,780
They tell me if I currently have coronavirus.

783
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:59,640
I think this is part of them trying to get set up for citywide testing and kind of instantaneous timescales,

784
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,520
or as near as you can get when you're doing this kind of thing.

785
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,100
So, yeah, I'm helping.

786
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,380
Yeah, we cannot tell you if you have had coronavirus from your saliva.

787
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,320
We need your blood for that, John.

788
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,900
So, we can actually...

789
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,060
I can't do blood tests at home.

790
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:13,560
I pass out.

791
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,280
So, a spit test is good enough, then?

792
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,280
Because an awful lot of people have been stuffing things up their noses,

793
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,840
and it seems like if a spit test was adequate for this,

794
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,240
wouldn't they just have been spitting?

795
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:31,340
So, there are various papers comparing the utility of an asopharyngeal swab to saliva,

796
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,620
and saliva does seem to come out quite well,

797
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,440
but I think there's some slightly contradictory results.

798
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,340
The other problem is that I think trying to get people to swab their own noses and throats

799
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,980
successfully at home is quite difficult,

800
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,100
because when you need to swab your nose,

801
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,380
you need to swab your tonsils without touching the rest of your mouth,

802
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,520
which is quite complicated,

803
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,400
and possibly just spitting in a tube is better.

804
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,580
I can spit in a tube successfully,

805
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,780
but I cannot do any of the other things.

806
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,840
And I got a blood test at home once,

807
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,440
and it was like, prick your thumb and put blood in the thing.

808
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,760
And I have a phobia of blood,

809
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,200
but I was like, I could just prick my thumb.

810
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,260
I can't.

811
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,280
I can't.

812
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,240
As it turns out,

813
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,020
much easier to get the train to a different city

814
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,440
to have the blood test than it is to do at home for John.

815
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,860
I'll just come around with, like, a diamond pen

816
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,320
and write blue on it for you, John,

817
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,500
and I will charge you only 20 quid.

818
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,020
I didn't say, like, in what time slot I would come and visit you, John.

819
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,180
Yeah, in fact, John,

820
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,960
if I promise to do that,

821
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,140
will you quarantine me for 14 days in your house?

822
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,880
Oh, hello.

823
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,580
Hello.

824
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,620
Why is she unhappy?
