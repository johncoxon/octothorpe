1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,500
Amazingly, creating VR social spaces is one of the things that I am particularly interested in.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,240
You'd never guess.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,200
It turns out I was born to run parties without having to tidy up the house.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,160
Either before or afterwards.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:29,200
Hello everyone and welcome to the very seventh episode of Octothorpe,

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,400
a podcast about science fiction and science fiction fandom.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,840
We are sponsored this week by Stow Shirts.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,380
I'm John Coxon.

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,780
I'm Alison Scott.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,140
And I'm Liz Batty.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,240
For those listeners who are reading the news and Twitter and Facebook and sort of generally staying up to date,

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:58,240
there have been widespread protests against police brutality and the treatment of black people in the United States of America

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,120
for most of the last week.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:12,740
Here at Octothorpe, we are aware that a lot of you may be listening to us to get away from the terrible and awful news happening out there in the wider world.

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,460
But equally, we as a trio feel quite strongly about social justice.

16
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,040
And we are very much standing with the protesters.

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,380
As we are all white, we are not necessarily the best people to tell you where to go to educate yourself.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,500
So if the listeners of Octothorpe have any suggestions for literature or for places to donate money,

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:49,180
then please send us locks and tell us where we can donate money and what we can recommend to our listeners in order to help them educate themselves about everything that's happening at the moment.

20
00:01:49,180 --> 00:02:00,300
If you want to start educating yourself about black writers of speculative fiction, you could go and look at FIRE magazine and we'll put a link in the show notes to that.

21
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:07,640
And there's also the Black Specfic report, which reports on kind of the state of the industry.

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,060
The writer's survey, I think, is quite American-centric.

23
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,260
I'm not sure about the contributors to FIRE MAG, but I believe it is based in the USA.

24
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,660
So if anyone knows of any equivalent initiatives in the UK, I'd like to hear about them.

25
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,880
And I should say I've had a couple of people, as always happens when there's anything trending, getting in touch with me and saying,

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,320
have you made this badge or this T-shirt or this thing?

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,560
And I would suggest that you should go and get your protest gear from black and minority ethnic owned businesses.

28
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:52,160
In letter of comment news, we had a conversation of comment with Lillian Edwards at the first Thursday pub meeting,

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,940
in which she told us that Ian Sorensen says that my microphone is better now, which is true.

30
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,280
It is. Hurrah.

31
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,860
Last time we recorded was in the middle of Balticon, which was being held virtually.

32
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,000
It is the Baltimore SF Group's convention.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
It's held every year.

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,860
And they did a variety of programming and social spaces on the internet.

35
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,300
We decided not to talk about it last week because it was still happening.

36
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,500
But what did we think of Balticon?

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,580
Did we go to Balticon?

38
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,040
Liz, it's rather the wrong time zone for you, I understand.

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,180
Yes, really everything is in the wrong time zone for me.

40
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,160
But see, many, many podcasts previous to me complaining about this.

41
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,320
So I didn't.

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,820
It's like I keep meaning to go to things, but it's one that they're in the wrong time zone.

43
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,280
But also that every time there is a convention, I have to then work out what is its local time zone?

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,720
And how does that compare to my time zone?

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,080
And what time actually is it?

46
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,920
And usually I never get to the third stage.

47
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:11,540
So I have to say one thing I would implore virtual conventions to do is to maybe put somewhere in small letters their time in like UTC or something, just to make it easy for us all to work out what time it would be in our own time zone.

48
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,360
That is a good idea, actually.

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,880
That should be a thing that happens.

50
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm sure people from Con Zealand are listening to this podcast.

51
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,120
I am not sure people from Con Zealand are listening to this podcast.

52
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:32,920
I was intending to spend quite a lot of my weekend at those conventions, both at Wiscon and Balticon, and it mostly didn't happen.

53
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,500
And I'm not entirely sure why not.

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,560
I kind of dropped into the discords a bit and they were fine.

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,660
But I never found like the buzzing Zoom party of my dreams or anything of that kind.

56
00:04:48,660 --> 00:05:01,480
And I didn't go to any program items because I have a problem with my life at the moment, which is that for all that I'm locked down and can't do any of the things I would normally do, I am incredibly busy all the time.

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,580
I have no idea how this has happened, but it clearly has happened.

58
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,380
And I'm surrounded by things I should be doing all of the time.

59
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,940
Yes.

60
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,760
And so I didn't get to a lot of it.

61
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
I did talk a little.

62
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:25,320
I understand that Balticon was an enormous success and I talked a little bit to some people who had had a good time and they really liked lots of things about the way that it worked.

63
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,240
My wife, Espania, also attended Balticon and she wrote a very excellent blog post about it.

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,840
And she basically sent me a text message saying, I didn't lock, but here's a blog post.

65
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:45,640
So I will include a link to the blog post in the show notes and you can go and read her thoughts on everything.

66
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,720
Espania did an awful lot of socializing on Discord in the text chat.

67
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,640
So she had quite a different opinion of it than me and Alison did, which is interesting.

68
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
She, I think, thought it worked very well.

69
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,120
But she also went to some of the Zoom parties and she thought that that was that was good.

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,440
Right.

71
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:14,240
And I also talked to the Glasgow in 2024 team who said it was a lot of fun, but not very many people came to our room party.

72
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,220
So we're now worried about room parties at Con Zealand and will you run them all?

73
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,240
And I said, no, I would not run them all, but I will run one.

74
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,460
And they said it won't be very difficult because only a very few people will come.

75
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,180
And I'm like, not if I'm running it.

76
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,820
So I'm telling you now I'm going to have an awesome and enormous room party at Con Zealand.

77
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,240
And it will be timed at like, I don't know, eight o'clock in the morning UK time.

78
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,860
But, you know, just day drinking.

79
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,520
It's the best.

80
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,980
I will say that the problem I think the Glasgow in 2024 room party at Balticon had was that I did not know it was on.

81
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,100
So I did not attend.

82
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,360
And I feel as someone who is a pre-supporter of Glasgow in 2024 and man who was at Balticon,

83
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,860
I perhaps should be in the middle of the Venn diagram of people who heard about this room party.

84
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,260
So I do think there might have been a slight problem with the communication there,

85
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,280
because I would have been there with bells on had I realised it was happening.

86
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:18,860
I think you had to look down a long chain of information on Discord to find the Discord channel that was Glasgow in 2024 and then go to that.

87
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,720
And I think there was an issue with multiple nested Discords and possibly rather too many of them.

88
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:33,800
I think part of the problem is that, like, I don't know why they didn't advertise it on the Glasgow in 2024 mailing list, for instance, which I subscribe to.

89
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,700
If it's a virtual thing that anyone can come to, you can make it buzzing by advertising on your mailing list and then people will come.

90
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,880
I do think that there should have been, and I don't know if there was, I suppose I could double check as we record.

91
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:56,360
There should have been, like, a room party slash social notice board equivalent on the Balticon Discord.

92
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:03,840
If there was one of those, I'm not sure I really noticed it, but that probably should have been, like, quite prominent.

93
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,760
I will say, so, I went to Balticon.

94
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:15,520
I did not go to any Zoom parties because they all started after I went to bed, and I am some sort of lame person who goes to bed before 2am.

95
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,660
But I will say that, generally speaking, I enjoyed the panels I went to.

96
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,880
I went to three or four panels.

97
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:34,580
I went to a panel on Star Wars, the end of the saga, which I thought was going to be a super great panel, like, looking at the nine-part thing and, like, how it went and what they should have done differently and what they could take away.

98
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:42,460
And actually devolved into people just talking about their favourite parts from Empire Strikes Back, which, if I'm honest, wasn't quite the angle I wanted from the panel, and I eventually gave up.

99
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,880
I do wish that panellists would read the panel description.

100
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
Like, it's my biggest bugbear.

101
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,540
Just, guys, there's a description of what the panel's about.

102
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,060
Please discuss that, because that's why I clicked.

103
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,000
The other two that I went to were both on Tabletop Games, and they were actually really, really, really good.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,240
I really enjoyed the way that the Zoom kind of webinar mode lets you ask questions and stuff.

105
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,740
And then people from those panels were hanging out in the Discord text chat after the panels, and you got to talk to them a bit more there.

106
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,640
And you also got to see people talking about other gaming panels you might not have been to.

107
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,540
And that actually worked really well.

108
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:26,720
So I think from my perspective, I kind of mostly ignored the dealer's room, the artist's alley, and the fan tables on the Discord.

109
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,080
But the little gaming segment with the different channels worked quite well.

110
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:40,700
I think next time I would probably advise condensing the Discord channels for the dealers and artists of fan tables a little bit,

111
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,960
because I think there was just way too much variety there.

112
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,060
But I could see why they did that, but I'm not sure it was what they should have done.

113
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,680
But I think these things will be things that we get better at over time.

114
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,280
And I think Balticol is the first place I've seen do this with what I would say was quite a high level of success.

115
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,840
So I thought it was quite good.

116
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,780
I was quite encouraged.

117
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,420
I will say, harking back several minutes at this point,

118
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,580
Glasgow in 2024 did put it on their Twitter feed.

119
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,660
And I wonder if they're trying to do the sort of thing where they keep their mailing list low volume announcements

120
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,720
and announce things like an upcoming party in two days on their Twitter feed.

121
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
So that might be part of the issue.

122
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,280
OK, so Twitter is a terrible way to announce anything unless you announce it every half hour.

123
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,520
Because how people use Twitter is that when they're on Twitter, they dip in and a Twitter stream rushes past them.

124
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:41,600
And nobody's actually reading everything that the 9000 people they follow posts every single time.

125
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,740
It's even worse than Facebook for that.

126
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,580
And at least if you put something on Facebook and lots of people say they are going,

127
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,720
then eventually Facebook will go, oh, yes, that's an event I should probably show you.

128
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,580
Well, and the other thing is that I like the Glasgow in 2024 page on Facebook.

129
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,880
So if they had made it into a Facebook event, presumably they could have invited me and I would have seen it that way.

130
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,220
But I will agree that Twitter is great and I think it's very good for many things.

131
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,200
But the thing I think it's absolutely awful for is announcements.

132
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,840
Because as Alison just said, like the algorithm means that I don't see posts in the order they were published anyway.

133
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,120
And if Twitter doesn't show me that tweet, then there's no way for me to see it.

134
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,100
And the thing I love about mailing lists is that when someone sends me an email, I read the email.

135
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:34,240
And that is a one to one correspondence, which Facebook and Twitter are sadly algorithmically eroding.

136
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,400
Which I fully understand why they're doing that.

137
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,100
But it does.

138
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,020
It frustrates me when stuff is announced on Twitter.

139
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,080
And I'm like, but I never could have seen that.

140
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:52,600
Because I have run mailing lists, I now know that when you used to send things to people in the post, you never really understood how many people were reading them.

141
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,840
But when you email people, you do learn how many people are reading them because MailChimp or whatever you're using will give you a read percentage.

142
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,940
And if you're doing well, that read percentage is somewhere in the margin, in the order.

143
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,760
Like a convention mail app will probably get a 40% open rate.

144
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,480
And that's the reason why conventions are kind of going, we'll mail you less.

145
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,480
We'll not use the mailing list.

146
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,000
People just aren't reading their email.

147
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,960
No, and I understand.

148
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,520
I do think it's probably better not to pepper people with emails.

149
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,120
So I do.

150
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,840
I understand the tensions.

151
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,140
But what you actually do to announce things is you have multiple channels.

152
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,700
You get in touch with the people that you want to be at your fantastic buzzing party and say, will you be there?

153
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,980
And they go, yes, of course.

154
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,820
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

155
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,060
And you go, can you tell all your friends on your podcast or whatever?

156
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,880
Yeah.

157
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:53,520
And you actually, you know, it's like any other event would be that you do have to market things a little bit more aggressively than just sticking up your hands saying, we are running a room party at Balticon.

158
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:06,200
And of course, you busy people all over the world who are overwhelmed by the amount of stuff you have to do on the Internet at the moment will immediately think of our party as being the first thing that you want to do.

159
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:18,500
It's become clear that that in fact, Facebook marketing for conventions is quite effective at has been effective at pulling in people who would not habitually have gone to the Easter con.

160
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,360
The Easter con, the makeup of the Easter con has changed extremely dramatically over the last five years.

161
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:36,500
And although Lung Kong gets some of the credit for that, it's also the fact that we accidentally reached out to a broader community by just doing very basic social media stuff.

162
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,180
And also by the people who go talking about it and and raising buzz for it.

163
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:49,060
And I don't see any reason why you can't do that with the online conventions as well.

164
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,920
You just have to make sure that you've got a value proposition that is compelling at times when people have a lot of other things on their plate.

165
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:12,260
On the topic of value propositions, Con Zealand have announced that they are also going to use a mixture of Zoom and Discord to run their convention.

166
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:24,300
And one question we had when we read this is what is the value proposition of this, given that Balticon has done this seemingly free at the point of use?

167
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:32,660
So, Alison, did you want to start talking about this and then me and Liz can jump in with our excellent opinions?

168
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:39,840
I wanted to 100% make clear that I am pontificating from a complete state of ignorance here.

169
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,800
And I wanted to say that I guess that Balticon probably wasn't free.

170
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,720
That they will have had their convention that doesn't that runs every year.

171
00:14:50,720 --> 00:15:09,780
So they will have things like a corporate structure and a bank account and a set of and they would have been able to put some money into this in the knowledge that they will have future physical conventions in a way that conventions that only run once like a Worldcon may not be able to.

172
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,120
So it is possible that it was not as free as all of that.

173
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,660
These will all be tied together with a single sign in point for authentication.

174
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,660
So I feel like Con Zealand is planning to wall off its garden.

175
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:29,140
And I guess that Balticon, because it was free, didn't need to wall off its garden.

176
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:38,720
And my guess is that the process of saying only Con Zealand members are going to be inside the loop here will make this more expensive.

177
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,260
And if you can spot the flaw in that reasoning.

178
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,500
I think you're right.

179
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:58,700
I think that Balticon almost certainly as a continuing convention has a reserve that they can probably call upon because they are an established organization that has been going for a while and will have a continuity.

180
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:06,180
The disadvantage in this sense that Worldcons have is that each Worldcon, for those who don't know, is a separate organization.

181
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:16,980
And so there is no continuity in the amount of money on the organization that you have available to you other than what other Worldcons have been able to donate to you.

182
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:27,800
And I don't know how much Dublin did in donating to Con Zealand, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was relatively low because I suspect Dublin spent quite a lot of money on running their convention.

183
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:36,600
And so it might well be that this is mostly driven by the fact that Balticon might have a source of stability that Con Zealand doesn't.

184
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,660
And so it might well be a slightly unfair comparison to make in some ways.

185
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:51,900
If you look at the Easter Con, Easter Cons pass along money between Easter Cons and these pass alongs can often be quite large compared to the relatively small budget of an Easter Con.

186
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,700
And they've been getting bigger.

187
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:01,040
And we intended when running Folly Con to reduce the size of the pass along deliberately because we thought they were slightly too large.

188
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,360
But we did end up passing along quite a lot of money.

189
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:18,180
And we will use, I think, it is likely that most of that money is going to get used up dealing with this year's Easter Con, refunding where it needed to and incurring the expenses it couldn't get out of.

190
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:24,580
And then next year's Easter Con, coping with what is likely to be a very disrupted Easter Con for a number of ways.

191
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,600
And I would suspect that between those two, we will probably not have very much pass along at all left at the end of it.

192
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,700
So it's kind of like, oh, yes, Easter Con has been saving for a rainy day.

193
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,180
And that is a thing that that it's done now.

194
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:42,180
I imagine that Con Zealand has an enormous amount of incurred expenses that it cannot get out.

195
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,020
I think there's also one extra aspect that Con Zealand will have to deal with.

196
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:52,620
I think Balticon in a way could have sort of open zoom and open discord and largely fly under the radar.

197
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,440
And I didn't hear anything about any problems they had.

198
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,380
But I think a World Con is a much more visible entity.

199
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,260
And also the World Con has had problems in the past.

200
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:10,840
Well, you know, World Con is a higher profile thing and it has, you know, had the whole thing with the puppies and the Hugo nominations.

201
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:21,100
And it's possible they also feel that, A, they need to be a little bit more of a walled garden and to put some effort into making sure that no one disrupts their higher profile event.

202
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:33,740
And also into more people points to do moderation and to try and keep things as safe as possible for everyone when they do have the event just because of numbers.

203
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:45,300
So I don't think any of these open events have had problems.

204
00:18:45,300 --> 00:19:01,020
I think that segues quite nicely into a discussion about what the relative strengths of Zoom and Discord are in this space.

205
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:13,080
My understanding is that one of the reasons Discord has gotten more popular recently is because they've recently introduced an awful lot of features to allow for that kind of effective moderation to be more easily implemented.

206
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:23,280
And I saw that there were to get into the Balticon, you had to agree to a code of conduct before you were allowed to enter the Balticon Discord.

207
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,480
And there were moderators who were able to step in.

208
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,860
But I think you're right that ConZealand will have a harder time with that.

209
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,460
It will be a much bigger enterprise.

210
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:49,480
But I think it's interesting that the way that you see the way that Discord can be used to facilitate that kind of code of conduct might be one of the reasons we're seeing that as the like spokes in between the Zooms, which are the kind of panels and room parties.

211
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:57,360
And I think that's a really good use of the two technologies, really playing both to their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses.

212
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,900
Discord strength being like the fact it's always there and you can always go and it's got the moderation.

213
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,220
Zoom strengths being that the video quality is higher.

214
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,280
It's a lot easier to get started.

215
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,140
Like you just click a link and it appears and you can do the webinar mode stuff, which is all kind of baked in.

216
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,160
Very much playing to the strengths of both platforms.

217
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,280
Yeah, I mean, I think it's quite clear that a combination of Zoom and Discord is very good.

218
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,560
very good for all this stuff.

219
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:33,840
I mean, I haven't, I've not thought about running a party in the form of having the, having the actual party going on in Discord with a set of video chats.

220
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,940
But that might be a better way to run big parties.

221
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,620
I don't know.

222
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:43,100
I'm still, I'm still amazed that nobody has really solved the problem of running big parties.

223
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,960
Given that it's been months now and given that big parties are one of the things that humans like to do a lot.

224
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,980
I know I just keep talking about parties all the time.

225
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,220
When we get to what I'm doing to stay sane in the apocalypse, one of the things I've been looking at is whether there are any really good VR party apps,

226
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:04,340
because it feels like VR parties ought to be totally a thing that could solve all of these problems.

227
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,020
But you know what?

228
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,380
They're not.

229
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,320
Or at least if they are, I haven't found one yet.

230
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:15,980
And actually, one of the things that we were talking about, I'm almost certain it was on one of Alison's Interminable Zoom parties.

231
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:23,320
Possibly after a taff, possibly after a taff Zoom, maybe at the London Pub meeting, maybe a Thursday.

232
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:30,820
They're lovely, but there are many of them and they all slightly blur into one, which I enjoy about them.

233
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,740
And also, I've just Googled Interminable and they are endless.

234
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,000
You are always Zooming, Alison.

235
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,560
It is 100%.

236
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,820
I do not believe you will ever stop partying.

237
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,340
I am actually slightly less Zooming than I would like to.

238
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:54,640
I feel like I'm not running fewer events than I'd like to, but I kind of find I get to the beginning of weekend and goes,

239
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,780
who's running a party this weekend?

240
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,000
And there are never quite enough of those people.

241
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,520
So maybe there are great parties going on to which I am not being invited.

242
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
But there probably are.

243
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,520
But I feel like I never was going to invite me to loads of things now.

244
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,140
I'm going to have to go.

245
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,560
No, no, no.

246
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,700
But I would like there to be more things out there that I could just kind of drop into if I feel like it, where people will be having buzz.

247
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:28,340
But I will say that Jerry was saying that Balticon also had a presence on Second Life, where you could go and interact with people in Second Life.

248
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,760
And I was like, and it gets back to what you were saying about, yeah, about VR.

249
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Like, party like it's 1999.

250
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,060
Liz, do you use Second Life, avid Second Life user?

251
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,820
I have never used Second Life.

252
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,980
Me neither.

253
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,280
I used it in 1999.

254
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,780
Was it actually 1999?

255
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,780
I'm just checking.

256
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,820
But yeah, no.

257
00:22:51,820 --> 00:23:01,340
And I think that gets back to what you were saying about, like, it would be, it sounds like what you want is a VR world where you could go and, like, more realistically interact.

258
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,240
And then I heard that they were doing a Second Life thing.

259
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,140
And I'm like, oh, no.

260
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,040
Because I think that's the attempt to do something like that.

261
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:14,200
But I just don't think it actually works or provides that experience in any meaningful way.

262
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,140
And hopefully one day, but not today.

263
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,680
But kudos to them for trying.

264
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:26,160
I don't think Con Zealand has announced their aggressive Second Life utilisation yet.

265
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,560
And obviously I think I speak for all three of us when I say I'm waiting with bated breath to see what they plan.

266
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,800
I am actually wrong.

267
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,080
Apparently you can party like it's 2003.

268
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,700
Excellent.

269
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:48,580
Octothorpe is sponsored this week by Stow Shirts.

270
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,240
Stow Shirts makes political, science fictional and nerdy apparel and pin badges for a whole range of different interests.

271
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,720
Whether it's a virtual hug badge to tell a loved one you're thinking of them.

272
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,200
A shirt with an in-joke for SF fans or nerds.

273
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,960
A pronoun badge to wear on your work lanyard.

274
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,580
Or a political slogan for your next protest.

275
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,580
They're likely to have something for you.

276
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,640
Podcast host should speak here about their personal experience with the sponsor.

277
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,540
Erm, podcasts with her every week.

278
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,280
She's quite nice.

279
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,840
What's more, they can do custom badges and shirts.

280
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,340
Amend existing designs to suit your needs.

281
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,820
And they're happy to work with SF conventions and fan groups to help organise their merchandise offering and reduce stress on the committee.

282
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:38,580
Visit them today at stowshirts.com and use the code Octothorpe for a 10% discount.

283
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:48,140
We should talk briefly about the Nebulas and WhizCon.

284
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,140
Which we, I think I speak for the three of us, did not attend.

285
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,960
But Alison got some sneaky gossip before the Nebulas happened.

286
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,860
So, erm...

287
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,220
Well, it wasn't really sneaky gossip.

288
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:06,480
Stephen Silver said he'd been running Zoom parties along the lines of the ones that I've been running for up to 500 people.

289
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,580
Although he'd been running them for up to 150 people with a plan to run for up to 500 on Nebula weekend.

290
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,500
And I've heard nothing.

291
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,440
I feel like if 500 people had gone to the Nebula party, I would have heard about it.

292
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,640
But they were probably all American science fiction authors.

293
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,700
So maybe not.

294
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,760
But if you were at the Nebula Zoom party, do let us know how it went.

295
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,280
So he was using the same system as we do where you have a lot of breakout rooms.

296
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,660
People move between them.

297
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:42,480
He was doing a thing very cleverly where he put everybody into a lobby and then he had moderators in the lobby trying to divide people up into smaller rooms.

298
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,540
I slightly worry that that leaves you with hundreds of people in the lobby.

299
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,580
And he was leaving people in the waiting room until he had a bunch of, say, six.

300
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:55,740
And then he'd bring them all in at once and give them the spiel about how it was going to work and things like that.

301
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,920
But I don't that was all in the practice, which is what we talked about.

302
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,860
So, Stephen, if you're listening, then that would be a great thing to know about how it went.

303
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,080
And yeah.

304
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:13,140
And if you're not listening, if anyone was at the Nebula Zoom party, I really, really want to know how it went.

305
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:21,120
The one thing I must say I really dislike about Zoom is the bit where you wait for the host to notice that you want to party.

306
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,100
And they eventually let you into their party.

307
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,620
But it's, I guess, a bit like queuing to get into a room party at a Worldcon.

308
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,980
So it's a pleasing recreation of a Fannish tradition.

309
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:43,920
It's replicating that bit of the party where you decide to go to party and you get a drink and you sort of hang around at the edge trying to work out if you know anyone at this party or if you're just going to stand around looking like you are a cool loner.

310
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:50,620
It's actually replicating the part where you're standing on the doorstep and your host has had a, has engrossed in conversation.

311
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,860
And the last thing they want to do right now is open the door.

312
00:26:52,860 --> 00:27:01,740
The other thing we did not attend was WizCon.

313
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,460
Do, Liz, do you know anything about WizCon?

314
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,320
Yes, I have been to WizCon quite a long time ago now.

315
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,460
2006.

316
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,180
And I enjoyed it.

317
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,760
But I've never managed to go back.

318
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,500
So I was sort of thinking about trying to go back when it was a virtual convention.

319
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,400
But I completely failed to do so because of inertia and time zones.

320
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,120
But they, I think they were paid as well.

321
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,200
So I would have had to make a proper commitment to working out if I could go to things really before.

322
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,620
You couldn't sort of dip in and out.

323
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:37,820
But it is the, of the ones that were running on Memorial Day, that was the one I would quite have liked to go to.

324
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,100
Registration for WizCon cost $10.

325
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,380
You could pay $0 if you could not afford the $10.

326
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:53,240
And they also had membership levels at $25 and $55 for those who felt able to more support the convention.

327
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,140
So it wasn't, it wasn't sort of Con Zealand levels of money.

328
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,460
But it was sort of a small tip.

329
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,380
I hadn't realised it was only $10.

330
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,760
I think I must have seen one of the higher numbers and decided I need to think about it.

331
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,380
If it was only $10, then that is within my realm of, yep, I'll just take a plunge on that.

332
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,940
And if I don't end up going to any of the events, well, I like WizCon and they can have my $10.

333
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,920
Yes.

334
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,180
No, that is fair.

335
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,780
I was, I don't know whether Balticon had a tip jar, but it does occur to me as well that you,

336
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:31,340
you really need to have some sort of like PayPal or, or drip or whatever other service tip jar on your,

337
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:37,140
on your convention website to allow people to contribute to the costs, I think.

338
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,380
I'm still very much looking forward to Con Zealand.

339
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,420
I am.

340
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:52,580
I think part of the thing about the virtual trip is trying to get myself into a headspace where I really am focusing.

341
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,100
When you, there's a focus thing.

342
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,060
When you decide to go to an actual convention in actual life, you go, right, I am going off.

343
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,880
If we ever have these again, I go somewhere for the weekend and I spend my weekend there and I do the convention.

344
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,780
When a virtual convention comes into your life, you're kind of like, oh, I'm doing everything else I'm doing else.

345
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,040
And then also there's this convention going on.

346
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:24,240
And I think actually saying, no, I'm going to block out three days and the convention is going to be what I do for those three days is a very different way to think about these.

347
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,460
And I'm not sure how many of us are doing that just yet.

348
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,720
Did that make any sense?

349
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,960
That did make sense.

350
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,380
Because I think when I was thinking about, oh, should I try and get to any of these online conventions over the Memorial Day weekend?

351
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,240
I was thinking about it in, oh, I might dip in and out of some events if they're in the right time zone.

352
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,180
I wasn't thinking I will take the plunge and commit my weekend to it as I normally would for a convention.

353
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,600
Yes, I think, I think that's fair.

354
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:59,920
And I think that was very much the thing I did with Balticon was I signed up for the panels that I was interested in going to and were in the right time zone.

355
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:07,380
And then I didn't really think I was attending Balticon, but I got to go to some cool panels, which is the way I was thinking about it.

356
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:20,560
But I think if there was going to be a convention I usually attend happening virtually, I would be taking that as a I will block the time out and do this as if I am at the convention.

357
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:30,780
And the next convention for which that happens is probably going to be the Virtual UK Games Expo, which is being held in mid-August.

358
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:39,900
They have cancelled the physical one and they are holding a virtual one and I will be thoroughly and enthusiastically attending.

359
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,540
Oh, how much does it cost and what are its dates?

360
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:50,320
So it's the 21st of August to the 23rd of August.

361
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,120
I have found the part on the website.

362
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,480
We've decided to make Virtual UK Expo freely available to anyone who wants to join in.

363
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,060
So there are no entry tickets, but there will be the option to donate.

364
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:09,040
And some activities such as role playing games and tournaments will still require individual tickets and will attract a small fee in order to participate.

365
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:16,220
So free to attend the sort of show floor, but perhaps small amounts of money to attend some of the events happening.

366
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,780
They're using Twitch, Discord, Zoom, YouTube.

367
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,500
It's being sponsored by Pezo and Weyland Games and Warhammer and Catan.

368
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,480
So big sponsors.

369
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:42,140
I had not heard of UK Online Games Expo and because gaming conventions are one of the things that I very, very much enjoy, but have had to decide are a piece of life that is too much for me.

370
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,320
You know, I can't manage to squeeze them into my life.

371
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,680
I'm actually extremely excited about the idea of a virtual one and I might well come along to that.

372
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,760
So that's quite exciting.

373
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:06,660
It's going to be very interesting to see how some of the tournaments are run because Asmodee, which is one of the big, big board game companies in the world, has been clamping down on methods to virtually play their games in recent weeks.

374
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And it will be interesting to see how you run a tournament for a game that has no official digital client and the parent company of which has been strongly discouraging online play.

375
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,300
So I don't know whether those will actually happen or what they will look like if they do.

376
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,140
But, you know.

377
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,420
Which games are Asmodee?

378
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,880
What games are they famous for, John?

379
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,300
So they do anything with the Arkham Horror branding is Asmodee.

380
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,160
Anything with the Star Wars branding is Asmodee, unless it's Hasbro.

381
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,540
But there aren't any tournaments for Hasbro games.

382
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:46,360
Anything with Legends of the Five Rings branding, Game of Thrones branding.

383
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,860
Catan is Asmodee.

384
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,180
Like, if it's not Hasbro and it's not Wizards of the Coast, it's probably Asmodee.

385
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,720
It's basically how it breaks down.

386
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,280
Ticket to Ride, Pandemic, Carcassonne, Small World, Mysterium.

387
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm not sure they originally developed all of those, but they've sort of swallowed up some smaller companies at this point.

388
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,800
So essentially, huge swathes of games are now Asmodee.

389
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,180
They've been eating companies and then they recently got sold to a venture capital company.

390
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,580
And, you know, capitalism is great, obviously.

391
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,880
You wouldn't hear a word against it, but yeah, slightly sad.

392
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,980
Oh, so they're basically the electronic arts of board games.

393
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,920
Oh, jeez, that is a particularly good comparison, which makes me very, very sad, Alison.

394
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:44,680
So essentially, the bit where you're starting to spend too much money on Arkham Horror, you have no idea how that's going for you.

395
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,140
Right, let's move on.

396
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:58,940
We should talk about the Hugo Voter Packet on the subject of things which are terrific value.

397
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,980
I signed up for a supporting membership to Cod Zealand after the last episode of Octothorpe,

398
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,340
and I have downloaded my Hugo Voter Packet.

399
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,740
Alison and Liz, have you downloaded Hugo Voter Packets?

400
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,620
I have, but it took me so long to download my Hugo Voter Packet, which is enormous.

401
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,780
I had to have a little lie down after that, so I haven't really looked at it very much.

402
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,820
But you have told me that it has the whole of The Wicked and the Divine in it, and I am very excited about that.

403
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,460
Because The Wicked and the Divine is an excellent graphic novel that everyone should read.

404
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:36,600
Yes, it has the entire of Wickediv, The Wicked and the Divine, and it also has the entire of Monstrous and the entire of Paper Girls in it.

405
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,900
So all of the back issues for those comics are available.

406
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,780
And I think Liz is particularly excited.

407
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,660
Well, I have already read all of Wickediv as well, so I do not need that from my Voter Packet.

408
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:55,080
I basically haven't signed up to Cod Zealand yet, but I am considering signing up for a supporting membership.

409
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:01,780
Basically, I will sign up for a supporting membership in a very mercenary way if the amount of stuff I haven't read,

410
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,040
which is in the Voter Packet, makes it seem like a worthwhile proposition,

411
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,600
and then I basically get to vote in the Hugos as a bonus.

412
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:16,000
Okay, I'm going to put my grumpy old fart cap on now and go,

413
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,400
I believe in the Worldcon community, and I think that it is worth buying a supporting membership to the Worldcon each year,

414
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,640
even for years in which you could not possibly travel to it,

415
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,140
because we are one, if you can afford it, obviously,

416
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,480
because people have to spend their money on different things,

417
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,300
because we are one community,

418
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,000
and having the membership every year,

419
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,560
and voting in site selection and the Hugos,

420
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,840
and being part of the Worldcon community is a bigger thing than any one Worldcon,

421
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,960
and you understand that sometimes the Worldcon will go to places that you cannot possibly get to.

422
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,620
Don't go where I can't follow!

423
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, like that.

424
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,640
I do buy supporting memberships to the Worldcon every year for exactly those reasons.

425
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,600
The reason I bought the Con Zealand one very late is because I thought I had voted in site selection at San Jose,

426
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:12,800
but I can find no evidence that this thought was actually based in facts or anything approaching evidence.

427
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,760
So having reluctantly conceded I might not have done that, I eventually bought a supporting membership.

428
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:27,160
But yes, usually I vote in site selection, and that gets me my supporting membership without me having to do anything else.

429
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,960
But this time it does not appear to have worked, which is probably my own stupid fault.

430
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,980
It's true. I sound overly obsessed with free stuff at this point.

431
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:43,900
I have bought quite a lot of supporting memberships in various conventions and Worldcons in the past.

432
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,180
I don't know why I never got round to buying one for Con Zealand.

433
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,940
I think it is now clear that putting your things in the Hugo but voting pack

434
00:36:52,940 --> 00:37:01,060
does encourage people to pay attention to them and maybe vote for them and certainly increases the chance that they will win the Hugo,

435
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:06,460
but probably is also quite good advertising for things generally.

436
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:17,080
I worry slightly about the tendency for people to buy Worldcon memberships just for the Hugo pack,

437
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,800
because it's not quite that's what gave us the sad puppies,

438
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,240
but that's what gives us a group of people who are interested in the Worldcon

439
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,180
only for what it can provide as a reading service.

440
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,980
And that seems a bit of a shame.

441
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:38,100
Yes, I don't want to suggest that the only reason to support the Worldcon is the Hugo voter packet,

442
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:47,040
but obviously the Hugo voter packet is a pretty fantastic perk that one gets if one is in that community.

443
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:55,420
And I will say that I have oftentimes used the Hugo voter packet as a way to try to encourage friends

444
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,480
who are perhaps less in the Worldcon fandom to support the Worldcon

445
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,860
and maybe bring them slightly more into the fandom,

446
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:08,840
which is, I think, also a kind of good carrot to use, if that makes sense.

447
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:15,560
It's true. I also feel that I am sufficiently embedded in Worldcon fandom

448
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,880
and have given quite a lot of my effort in kind to Worldcons in the past,

449
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,660
but I don't feel I always need to support them with my money.

450
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,480
That's fair. For those who don't know, Liz has deputy department headed,

451
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,280
well, sorry, no, Liz has deputy division headed at Worldcons in the past,

452
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,040
a job which is very difficult.

453
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,800
Alison has also deputy division headed in the past, a job which was very difficult.

454
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,020
And I have also deputy division headed in the past, a job which was very difficult.

455
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,280
So we are all speaking as deeply entrenched members of Worldcon fandom

456
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,240
who have never been quite daft enough to rise to the position of full division head,

457
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,740
which would be insane.

458
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,540
This is where Alison is like, I was division head of something.

459
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,080
And I'm like, oh, no, why?

460
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
No, no, no. I've been area head.

461
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,180
I was area head at 1995 and 2005.

462
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,360
And I was a DDH at 2014 and have no further intention,

463
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,320
have no ambitions in that direction at all.

464
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,380
Yes. The only one of us who will ever chair a Worldcon is, of course, Liz.

465
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,060
I've been going down in responsibility.

466
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:32,480
I've gone from deputy division head to area head to person who hangs around a bit

467
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,500
because they know how the programming database works.

468
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,380
So clearly my next role will be just hanging around for no reason whatsoever.

469
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,380
Excellent.

470
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,620
I think I should say that it isn't a progress.

471
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:46,880
So I have been, I did area head jobs at two UK Worldcons and then a DDH job.

472
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,480
But at other Worldcons, I have also taken quite dull staff roles,

473
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,480
like, for example, the person whose job it was to inject jokes into the newsletter

474
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,780
and that sort of thing.

475
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,440
That's a pretty vital role.

476
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:07,800
Shall we move on to staying sane in the apocalypse,

477
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,580
aka Alison attempts to bring the entire world to her house?

478
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,720
So what have I done?

479
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,840
I've run some more Zoom parties.

480
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:21,780
One of the exciting things that happened this month is that Facebook included a checkbox on events

481
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,600
for this event is happening online,

482
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,240
which has stopped the repeated messages that I and all my attendees were getting,

483
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,580
saying, are you really going to an event with 50 people?

484
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,720
Don't you know that that's not allowed under the lockdown rules?

485
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,480
So now it has a little checkbox where you can say my event is happening online.

486
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,460
But being Facebook, I slightly worry that what Zuckerberg is doing is trying to,

487
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,220
because now I get a lot of advertising from Facebook about how wouldn't I be rather using Facebook's social media,

488
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,840
Facebook's video conferencing tools, to which the answer is no.

489
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,140
I am still using a combination of Zoom and breakout rooms because I've not yet found anything better.

490
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,820
But I could be persuaded into Discord instead.

491
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,100
And yes, I'm running big Zooms.

492
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,480
I'm running small Zooms.

493
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,900
I've not gone into the enormous.

494
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,800
I kind of think once you've got about 20 or 30 people,

495
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,300
that's probably enough for me to have a fantastic time.

496
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,080
And there's an extent to which I don't necessarily care about anybody else.

497
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,220
And I have bought a VR rig.

498
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,200
That's why I bought an Oculus Quest.

499
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:27,320
My child stopped working for me on the completely spurious excuse that she was studying for her finals

500
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,700
and therefore did not have any time to make badges for minimum wage.

501
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,900
So you'll notice that she does have time to run a turnip empire on Animal Crossing.

502
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,480
But, you know, people make their own priorities.

503
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,720
I mean, to be fair, Alison, you're benefiting from the...

504
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,440
I was about to say you're benefiting from the fruits of her labours.

505
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,880
But obviously you're benefiting from the vegetables.

506
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,280
All right, that's it.

507
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,140
Stop the podcast.

508
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,600
Episode 7, we're peaked.

509
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,900
There's nowhere down...

510
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,060
Nowhere but downhill from here.

511
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,500
Right.

512
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:03,780
So instead, I basically had to do all the minimum wage badge making and shipping work last month.

513
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:08,460
And at the end of the month, I looked at what I thought I would have paid for the number of hours I had spent doing it.

514
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,660
And I bought an Oculus Quest.

515
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:17,840
And also because I had said when I decided to buy nothing that I would spend my money on experiences rather than things.

516
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:33,620
And if I still can't get out of my house to do anything, then clearly sticking a headset on and going and swimming with dolphins or playing some VR game is as close as I can get to new experiences.

517
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,780
And they are new experiences.

518
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,940
It was like utterly science fictional.

519
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,380
It was completely sensor wonder for me.

520
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,960
Now, I mean, I'd obviously used some VR stuff before, but there's something about the fact that it doesn't use wires.

521
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,140
So it's just wherever you happen to be.

522
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:59,640
So you can take a tiny patch of your house from which you've managed to clear clutter and then you put this headset on and suddenly you're in a gorgeous geodesic dome that has been tastefully furnished by somebody else.

523
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,160
And you go, oh, I can see how we might all be doing this.

524
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,880
And it's equal parts of, oh, my God, this is a really futuristic feeling.

525
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,400
And, oh, my God, the world as I know it is going to collapse.

526
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:21,240
I look at what has happened between when I bought my Nintendo Game & Watch in 1980 and the Oculus Quest.

527
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:32,800
And I extrapolate forward and I'm like, we are going to get to the point where real life does not necessarily have a lot to offer that is better than these systems.

528
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,080
It is the opinion of the Octothorpe podcast that we should all live in.

529
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:45,320
Small pods plugged into some sort of central computer where we socialise without risk of pandemic.

530
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,260
And is this how the Matrix starts, Alison?

531
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,040
Is this how the Matrix starts?

532
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,280
That was literally where I got to.

533
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,300
I was like, I can see a world where actually people do this an enormous amount.

534
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,040
And that's the Matrix.

535
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,280
Yeah.

536
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,340
And that was kind of weird.

537
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,040
That was a very weird feeling.

538
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:24,040
And yet, when you sort of go, well, if, say, Facebook's creating avatars now, and you can see that one of the reasons that Facebook's creating avatars is if you want to do something that's like Second Life but works, getting people to have realistic, consistent avatars for themselves is one of the ways in which you make that happen.

539
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,580
So you go into your virtual space.

540
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,060
And you go, oh, yeah, that's John, because I recognise his avatar.

541
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:34,180
And this is all quite the weird thing.

542
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:39,920
But, you know, when you're saying, well, we can't actually go to see, I still can't see my family.

543
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,100
And I feel like there's going to be attractions to this sort of thing.

544
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,360
Also, Beat Saber is a lot of fun.

545
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,180
Beat Saber is fun.

546
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,280
Beat Saber is the only VR game I have played.

547
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,500
And I like rhythm games because they're the only games I'm actually any good at.

548
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,480
Every other game, I have to put it on easy mode and die a lot.

549
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,540
And Beat Saber is just like, yeah, I'm going to go for this.

550
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,340
And it's fine, although hard work.

551
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,840
So Beat Saber is great.

552
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,660
Have you played any other VR games?

553
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:22,120
Because do they make, and someone should have made this, a sort of like Matrix crossed with Half-Life, crossed with Inception style game where you can do the Matrix and run up walls and re-shift reality?

554
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:28,820
I think my feeling about games, Beat Saber is fine, but Beat Saber feels to me like a tech demo rather than a game.

555
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:36,280
I feel like we are, so there's a set of games that are coming out now that are set of the Star Wars universe where you get to run around with a lightsaber.

556
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:44,800
But I feel like we are only at the very beginning of exploring what you can do with this game space.

557
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:54,840
There is a game called Superhot VR, which people talk about where you only move, the bad guys only move when you do.

558
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,900
You're in a kind of weird Matrix-like environment there, and there is bullet time.

559
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,580
So as long as you're not moving, the bullets aren't moving.

560
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,540
And if you start to move, then the bullets move.

561
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,240
And that is quite freaky.

562
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,240
And it also is quite intense.

563
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,860
When they talk about intense VR experiences, they mean roller coasters.

564
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,480
They mean things that set off your balance.

565
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,680
So it's not intense in that way at all.

566
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,220
But I found it intense in a gaming way.

567
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,940
I am five foot tall, and it didn't seem to have any height adjustment.

568
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,020
So these guys that were coming towards me, but only when I moved, were much bigger than I was.

569
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,560
And that was quite freaky.

570
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,620
I've only played the demo, and I'm not saying I won't buy it.

571
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:52,160
But it felt like, and I've heard other people talking about VR and saying that some of the really intense first-person shooter games are not working for them because it is just all too much.

572
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,560
So other people really like that sort of stuff.

573
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,300
But it's just early days.

574
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,340
Early days for all this stuff.

575
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,640
And there is a game called Star Trek Bridge Command, I think, that Ming pointed me at.

576
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,520
Ming has a headset.

577
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,160
Ming is in New Zealand.

578
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,600
Ming and I could play.

579
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:13,660
This is a cooperative game where you work with other people on the bridge of the Enterprise or some Federation starship in order to solve problems.

580
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,520
And I haven't actually played it yet.

581
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:28,460
But that's something that feels to me the sort of thing that I am actually looking for, which is cooperative games in VR between people who are not located in the same space in the real world.

582
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
To make up for a thing like board game.

583
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,120
I like cooperative gaming generally.

584
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:41,180
There's apparently a version of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, which is a game which my family has played endlessly to the death.

585
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:46,820
We have absolutely wrung all the love out, all the possible joy out of this game at this point.

586
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,500
But apparently there's a VR version of that.

587
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:58,980
So that one of you is sitting with headphones and the quest and the VR set on with the bomb in front of you and actually physically manipulating it.

588
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,840
And the other people are sitting with the decoding manual trying to tell you what to do.

589
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,880
But I have not played that either.

590
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,000
So I've played a bit of Beat Saber and I've done a few.

591
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,040
I've done some things like.

592
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,160
I have done some VR.

593
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:18,420
I have played the Star Wars VR game on PlayStation 4.

594
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,620
And it made me feel a little bit queasy.

595
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:31,120
I had to spend some time looking very fixedly at a planet in the distance in order to avoid feeling very queasy.

596
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,640
So I am.

597
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,300
But I'm very much looking forward to VR becoming a bigger thing.

598
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:51,260
Because one of the things I really am finding very difficult about the apocalypse is that I have a weekly role play in which we do quite a lot of highly cooperative storytelling.

599
00:48:51,580 --> 00:49:08,340
And part of the problem with Zoom and Discord and all of these things is that it's very difficult to pick up on other people's social queues in a way that means that everyone can join in without having to sort of go round the room pointing at people saying,

600
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,240
Now it's your turn.

601
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:09,980
Now it's your turn.

602
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:15,400
Because louder voices dominate and quieter voices find it difficult to get a look in.

603
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,280
And this can really disrupt the dynamic.

604
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,060
So I'm very much looking forward to VR as a mechanism for role playing games.

605
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:29,340
Because I think, I hope, that VR will be a better way of doing that that doesn't fall prey to the same problems that video chatting falls prey to.

606
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:36,320
So I am sort of optimistic and hopeful about the potential for VR chatting as a replacement for video chatting.

607
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,000
But I don't know what time scale that's a realistic proposition on.

608
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,340
20 years.

609
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,360
Like nuclear fusion, right?

610
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,040
It's 20 years away.

611
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,780
No, I think it depends really on how pandemic goes.

612
00:49:50,780 --> 00:50:04,500
Because if we are still here in a year, not really going to the pub, then I think at that point, a lot of this stuff will have happened because there will be so infinitely much money in it.

613
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:22,420
I also did see, and I've been looking for the link for ages, which is why I've been super quiet, someone developed a sort of top-down 2D chat room idea where you wander about a 2D space and you can talk through your microphone.

614
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,560
And people who are closer to you can hear what you're saying more clearly and people who are further away hear you less clearly.

615
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:34,340
And you can wander around an actual kind of physical space talking and it replicates a bar in 2D.

616
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,960
And I am looking for the link and the name of this and I cannot find it.

617
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,900
It's very frustrating.

618
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,680
If I do find it, I'll put a link in the show notes.

619
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,480
But...

620
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,980
So they've got to get...

621
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:52,780
The problem with all of these systems at the moment is that they have to get over the level of adequacy

622
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:58,100
that we've established now with the Zoom and the breakout rooms, which is clearly not that adequate,

623
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:03,580
but it's still a lot better than a lot of these systems are quite managing yet.

624
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:09,140
And the other thing about the VR rig that I was going to say is that although my house is not small, really,

625
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,500
it's got five adults in it.

626
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,100
And I've been...

627
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,260
And I don't think of myself as the world's greatest introvert.

628
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,060
But when I put on the quest...

629
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,340
We don't think of you as the world's greatest introvert either.

630
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,620
No, you're a terrible introvert, Alison.

631
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,920
Yeah, indeed.

632
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,840
But when I put the quest on, I'm alone in a way that I never am in my own house at the moment.

633
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,240
And I quite like that.

634
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,740
It's quite isolating.

635
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,720
And I have been missing feeling...

636
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,720
It's odd in a time of self-isolation.

637
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:53,260
I have been missing feeling actual time alone to do things I want to do in comfortable spaces because my house is lost.

638
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,660
I've made that many comfortable spaces and they're awful.

639
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,300
The name of the service I was thinking of is Calla.

640
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,080
And I will put a link in the show notes.

641
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,460
It is C-A-L-L-A.

642
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,960
Is this a thing you're planning to use on your virtual guff trip, Alison?

643
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,800
I am hoping that I will be able to do some of my tours virtually.

644
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:23,600
I have a really whizzy idea that I am going to do VR stuff whilst streaming it to Twitch.

645
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,100
Streaming both the VR stuff and me using Twitch streaming tools, which I already use a little bit.

646
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:36,400
And so that people will be able to come along and watch me swim off the Great Barrier Reef in real time or something.

647
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,180
And that will be hilarious.

648
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:50,160
Please get in touch for recommendations for ways we can support and learn about the Black Lives Matter movement

649
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,760
and also BAME people in the UK and in the community in the UK in general.

650
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,540
And please also write in with your experiences of virtual conventions.

651
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,860
We would love to hear from you.

652
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,800
Thank you to Stow Shirts for supporting our podcast this week.

653
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,360
That was the seventh episode of the Octothorpe podcast.

654
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,840
So it's goodbye from me.

655
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,460
And it's goodbye from me.

656
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,060
It's goodbye from me.

657
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:19,000
The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin MacLeod at incompetech.com

658
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,780

659
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:37,540
Is this the point where I can say that Lillian and Christina are hoping to do a podcast?

660
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:42,400
And when they first told me about this, or rather when Lillian first told me about this, I said,

661
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,000
but you'll have to find someone to do all the work.

662
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,080
And they have now found Ian Sorensen, I believe.

663
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,240
So he is investigating other podcasts, which is how he's paying attention to John's microphone.

664
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,400
So I'm very much looking forward.

665
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,220
I am waiting with bated breath for that podcast to appear in my podcast feed.

666
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,020
I will be listening avidly.

667
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,800
Yes, no pressure, obviously.

668
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,420
The fact that we've announced it doesn't have any ramifications for whether it has to happen.

669
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,460
And Alison's decision to do that was entirely her own.

670
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:30,420
One of the things I always liked about fanzines back in the day was that they could be...

671
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,420
Relentless piss takes.

672
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:38,560
You know, a little bit edgy about the community and the things the community were getting up to.

673
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,840
And I feel like we should capture some of that flavour in our podcast.

674
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,420
More antagonism.

675
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:54,160
I do feel if I was going to pick some adjectives to describe our podcast, edgy would be quite a long way down the list.

676
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,500
Oh, okay.

677
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,360
No, I maybe don't mean edgy.

678
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:08,780
Are you indicating that you think three middle class white people during a podcast are not at the forefront of edge?

679
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,240
We talk about things we like, Liz.

680
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,160
What could be more edgy than this?

681
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:18,860
My 19-year-old son did call me an edgelord this week.

682
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:24,260
Right, well, we're going to come back to that later, 100%.

683
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,600
And I was like, what do you mean by edgelord, dear?

684
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,100
And he explained.

685
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,360
And I said, you mean like Kylo Ren?

686
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,160
And he said, yes.

687
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:33,580
Oh, dear.

688
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,660
Oh, Alison.

689
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,020
And I said, that's unfair.

690
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,780
I said, what I actually said was, that's unfair.

691
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,300
Whash, whash, whash, whash, whash.

692
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,720
But we'll come back to that.

693
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:52,700
I would like to reassure people that Alison was miming destroying a control console with a lightsaber and not miming beating her children.

694
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,800
That's important to note.

695
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,700
The context of the video was key in that particular interaction.

696
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,140
Before we descend...

697
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,480
Also, your lightsaber noises are terrible.

698
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,100
Yeah, everyone knows it goes vwom.
