1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,940
I'm glad you attributed to me a joke I didn't make. That's quite good. You're now hallucinating

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,760
jokes you think I made. So I'm just gonna take credit.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, it's the dream Liz in John's head made that joke.

4
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,320
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 146th episode of Octothorpe,

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,500
which is finding a board game in its parents' attic and being transported into a magical world

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,840
on the 23rd of October 2025. I'm John Coxon.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm Alison Scott.

8
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,380
And I'm Liz Batty.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,320
Hello Liz!

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,900
Hello, I'm back.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,820
Yes! Hello Liz!

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,300
Who are ya? Who are ya?

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,800
Because last time we had an emergency stunt, Liz.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,440
yeah I think I'd vaguely said guys that date might be difficult oh guys I think that date's

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,920
really difficult oh I think that's gonna be really difficult I think I can't do it

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,760
and then at some point we kind of went oh wait we don't have any episodes in the bag

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,600
quick stunt Liz so thank you Tommy for being a stunt me and a very good stunt me

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,680
yes it was great it worked out very well I agree I got to listen to an episode that was very nice

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,720
you're welcome back anytime Tommy except for if Liz is available I got dibs and also we obviously

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,300
have all the other stunt liz is to work through not repeated yet we have two letters of comment

21
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,220
uh because the episode went up about five hours ago as we record listeners um firstly johnny

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,920
badly says he also didn't know about irish fandom day so there was there was one yes

23
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,380
uh two two now there's but there's lots liz liz you also didn't know about irish fandom day

24
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,060
no and then secondly i got a dm from my friend ian who says i'm still wrong about the raid

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,600
in in what regard i don't like it ah he does like it your friend could keep sending that

26
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,760
once a week and they'd still be right that's true not that i wish to encourage harassment of john by

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,179
uh instant message because he's a wrong head it's not that you want to but you don't not want to

28
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,200
it's not like there's an objectively correct opinion here right i mean speaking as someone

29
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,980
who works in physics which you'd think had lots of objectively correct facts and yet there is still

30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,440
quite a lot of disagreement what even is correctness anyway story of the 21st century nobody knows

31
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,680
anything um yeah thank you very much for writing in both i think i do feel a little bit bad because

32
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,720
i feel that by releasing an episode while christopher j garcia is probably asleep and

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,540
then recording another one before he wakes up we've we've robbed him of some chances to uh

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,500
to write a lock oh i mean i'm i'm refreshing my emails periodically because i think there's a

35
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,860
sizable chance he'll write in while we record but we'll see a live lock excellent um we had we also

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,940
had a letter of comment from doug fawn who says how can we talk so much about core flu and not

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,120
mention the upcoming one in santa rosa um there's an upcoming core flu in santa rosa listeners

38
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,580
coreflu.org for more details coreflu pickles can we add a state to that because i don't know where

39
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:18,000
Santa Rosa is. Santa Rosa in California. It is the home of Peanuts and the place that the Peanut

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:26,820
Museum, Peanuts Museum is. Peanuts rather than Peanuts. The comic strip Peanuts. I thought you

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,040
said it was the home of Peanuts and I was like, well, where do Peanuts come from? Oh, okay.

42
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,580
And their tech ops volunteer is listed as Tommy Ferguson, tentative. I am very much,

43
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,720
I'm not planning to go to Corflou Santa Rosa, but I quite like to.

44
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,780
They've got lots of good ideas and they keep publishing restaurant reviews

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,540
because the committee keeps going to visit restaurants in Santa Rosa

46
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,220
and then writing about them, which seems quite nice.

47
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:55,900
That's fair.

48
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,360
Yeah, and if your committees still like each other enough to go to a restaurant,

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,500
then you're doing pretty well.

50
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,040
Committees don't tend to fall out very much doing Corflou

51
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
because it's not very hard convention.

52
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,320
so after a period um where not a lot's been going on or at least we've not been hearing a lot about

53
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:27,380
it um easter con 2026 which is iridescent iridescence not iridescent iridescence yeah

54
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:37,800
because it's plural oh no iridescence because it is a noun yeah and it's plural no if it was a noun

55
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:44,720
and it was plural it would be iridescences i think is that right i think iridesopods we we have some

56
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,960
funny names for easter cons these days anyway the 2026 easter con iridescence has risen phoenix-like

57
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:58,440
from the ashes and is getting on with things. And they have announced they've opened their hotel

58
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,680
booking, which is probably the most exciting to many of you. So if you're a member, you would

59
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,780
have had an email telling you how to book a hotel room. And if you haven't had any emails from them,

60
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,880
because they did send an email saying in a little while, but you're sending an email telling you how

61
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:21,540
to book a room, then you should check in your spam folder and whitelist them because the way to

62
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,980
book is to click on the link in your email. You have to be a member of the convention before

63
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:34,460
booking rooms. They've got quite a good rate for the hotel. There's a rate with or without breakfast

64
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,180
and I think the way in which the rates are particularly good is that the single room rate

65
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,200
is 50 quid lower than the double room rate.

66
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
So very unusually for Easter cons,

67
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,740
you can actually get a big discount if you're on your own

68
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,960
rather than having to pay almost twice

69
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,600
what a couple would for the same room.

70
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,800
No, almost twice what each half of the couple would

71
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,480
for the same room.

72
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,280
They have also opened applications for bursaries

73
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,780
if you'd like to go to Easter con,

74
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,700
but you would need some help to make that happen.

75
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,700
The deadline for that is the 31st of October.

76
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,280
So you've just got a little over a week after this episode goes out.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,780
Their volunteer form is open and they're encouraged,

78
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,220
even if you've made some formal arrangement, informal arrangement to volunteer where you always do.

79
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,560
They've suggested you fill in the volunteer form so they know that and know who you're working for and what you're doing.

80
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,200
And speaking of who you're working for and what you're doing,

81
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,800
there should be merchandise out by the time this episode goes live.

82
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,300
So you should be able to buy an iridescence T-shirt.

83
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,920
Who's doing the merchandise, Alison?

84
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,140
Well, it's using Espania's lovely design, but I'm making all of the merchandise happen.

85
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,380
But I haven't actually done it yet.

86
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,640
So it's a kind of theoretically I'm making all of the merchandise happen in the next few days.

87
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,760
So what you're saying is we should hassle John by DM about his opinions on the raid.

88
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,160
But if you really want an Iridescence T-shirt, you should hassle Alison.

89
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,000
There'll be a link in the show notes when this episode goes live and you'll just be able to click on it and buy it.

90
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:15,200
Am I right in thinking that the single room discount is because the Hilton is one of those weird hotels that actually does have some actual single rooms that you can't put two people in?

91
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,840
We were talking about this. Once upon a time, there were two hotels. This is like a long time ago.

92
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,300
And they loved each other very much.

93
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:33,060
Called the Metropole and the Warwick. And they were both owned by the Metropole, but the Warwick was full of really tiny singles.

94
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,420
And I think that might still be the case, but other people say, oh no, it's all been completely

95
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,660
refurbished since then. So I think probably it is those smaller rooms and they'll be sold as

96
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,020
executive singles or very, very small doubles, but they might be proper singles.

97
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,240
What is an executive single and why is it different than a single?

98
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,920
An executive single has a bed that is bigger than three foot, but one side of it is shoved up

99
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:09,360
against the wall. Ah, okay. In general. For executives. No, just not absolutely. But I mean,

100
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:16,720
don't quote me. They might just be regular singles. You know this whole podcast is on the record,

101
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,500
right? I will be going around telling people, look, Alice and Scott told me that's what an

102
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,980
executive single is. And if I ever get an executive single where the bed is not up against the wall,

103
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,840
and again, I will be in your DMs. Yep. That bed will be first against the wall when the

104
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,860
comes. I was thinking about

105
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,820
non-con from last week

106
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,740
and thinking, ooh, I could go to non-con

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,320
and I could go and stay in the bullet again.

108
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,800
Speaking of hotels where the rooms were.

109
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,560
Rather pokey.

110
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,480
Could just go to Belfast.

111
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,360
What, without visiting a convention?

112
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,240
Yeah, we'll make our own con

113
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
with cocktail bars and breakfasts.

114
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,020
That's crazy.

115
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,540
Crazy talk, Liz.

116
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,740
Crazy talk. Seems unlikely,

117
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,820
doesn't it? But I am a bit worried you're going to start

118
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,160
proposing cons in Belfast

119
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,240
just solely so that you can go to that hotel i mean there are worse reasons so have you put your

120
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:14,680
hotel rooms then yes yep have you no are you going don't know that's why i haven't booked

121
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:23,700
um so i'm not a member yet um i think the first night is non-refundable it is so yeah if you know

122
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,160
you're going go and book if you're not sure then you might want to hold off unless you want to

123
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,120
accidentally lose a night's room payment.

124
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,900
I'm sure there are hotels in the area that will sell you a refundable booking.

125
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,860
Yes, although when I looked at the Premier Inn,

126
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,060
there's a little note basically explaining that you can't cut through the car park anymore.

127
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,400
So it might not be such a good wheeze.

128
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,580
People were talking about the Moxie?

129
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,800
Yeah, that's just next door, isn't it?

130
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,160
I don't know where it is.

131
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,100
It's between the Metropole and the NEC, right?

132
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,260
It's on that block there.

133
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,200
Yeah, so when you come out of the big, like, massive bank of doors,

134
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,240
the Moxie is, like, right ahead of you, like, on the left.

135
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,020
I seem to recall hearing from someone, I think at a UK Games Expo,

136
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,200
that the Moxie is a bit crap, but I don't know if that's actually true,

137
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,180
and it might be getting confused with someone complaining about the Moxie in Glasgow,

138
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,020
and, like, I don't know.

139
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,960
So, again, don't quote me, listeners.

140
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,700
Fortunately, none of this is being recorded, so it's okay.

141
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,120
The Moxie is what it is.

142
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,040
I liked the Glasgow one quite a lot because it had...

143
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,660
If you're there for a convention, if you have a lot of luggage,

144
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,240
then you're going to struggle because there isn't any spare space in your room for your luggage.

145
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,420
But otherwise, it was completely fine.

146
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,980
Whereas regular listeners will know that the Hilton Metropole is quite nice.

147
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,520
It's not Hilton Metropole, is it?

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,620
Hilton Birmingham. Hilton Birmingham Metropole.

149
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm getting confused with the Brighton Metropole.

150
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,780
Hilton Birmingham Metropole is quite nice, but has no drawers.

151
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,960
Yeah, well, the Moxie doesn't have drawers.

152
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,800
What it does have is if you wake up in the middle of the night and stumble to the loo,

153
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,560
it has automatic underbed lighting that comes on,

154
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,660
which just I thought was the best thing ever, and I want every hotel to have that now.

155
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,260
I'm clearly the old person in this conversation.

156
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,140
I mean, I can turn the light on.

157
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,280
Yeah, but if you turn the light on, you'll wake up Stephen.

158
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,160
I mean, you won't wake up Stephen, but I will.

159
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,600
I won't wake up Stephen.

160
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,920
I have so many questions about what you two are doing in hotel rooms at conventions, but I ain't asking.

161
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,460
But, okay, I've been in plenty of places where there's, like, underbed lighting, and I agree that is quite neat,

162
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,640
but I also can just turn it on with a switch.

163
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,520
I don't need it to pop on automatically and scare the life out of me at 2am.

164
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:46,600
I think I don't necessarily want automatic lights, but I'm not.

165
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,220
It's fine.

166
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,680
I made four different thumbs-ups appear.

167
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,560
yes so listeners write in if you're going to iridescence um we will see you all there

168
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,780
iridescence is sharing its hotel with an anime convention which is called

169
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:15,619
something it's definitely called something yes harui con hawai con harui con h-a-r-u-h-i um

170
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:25,660
next spring 35th of april at the hilton birmingham metropole yes and i wanted to ask do you think

171
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,920
that they might do some sort of membership sharing between the two conventions given that they are in

172
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,400
the same hotel didn't they talk about trying to do something but presumably they're still

173
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:41,419
uh chatting about it and not ready to announce i guess like if they could do some sort of mutual

174
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,600
access to the vendor areas that would be neat because vendors like that. I think there should

175
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,400
be some scope here because I was assuming that it would be a gate show and primarily selling day

176
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,740
passes but it's not. It's tickets for a whole weekend. They are £75. That doesn't sound very

177
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,120
different from the Easter con. It's three days not four days but yeah they probably need to go and

178
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,440
talk about it. It feels complicated. I think it would be neat to have something because it would

179
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,680
be you know i am probably never going to go to an anime con but it would be neat to be able to go

180
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,960
and see bits of it i mean i'm assuming that i will get to see a lot of cosplay anyway but it would be

181
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,440
neat if we could kind of arrange something so i could see at least bits of it and similarly the

182
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,180
other way around we might attract people who would quite like to see bits of uh eastercom anyway i'm

183
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,059
sure that is in the works because they must be talking to each other a little bit um you'd think

184
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,000
so we will wait and see it's not that long now is it no it's true it's not six months six months

185
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,380
terrifyingly we are halfway since easter con and halfway to easter con yeah no it's it's kind of

186
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:54,220
terrifying how quickly it comes around yeah things come around faster and faster is it october already

187
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,279
what happened to the year just before we move on from easter con one other thing is that

188
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,460
applications for the art show

189
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,740
for dealers and for fan tables are open

190
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,820
and we will also have a link to that in the show notes

191
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,220
dear listeners

192
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,420
what about for suggesting program items

193
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,480
if for example you have some kind of podcast

194
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,440
that you might want to do a live show of

195
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,380
at eastercom

196
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,180
I... that's a great question

197
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,320
yeah iridescence right in

198
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,860
I'm not sure I've seen that yet

199
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,160
I don't think that has gone out

200
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,300
and I suspect it won't go out for a little bit

201
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,260
but I suspect it is coming

202
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,900
But yes, because I haven't.

203
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,940
I think the programme team is like beginning to spool up in earnest.

204
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,140
So stuff like that, I think, will come in the near future.

205
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,720
And when it does come online, we will, of course, request Octop Live if you want it through the appropriate channels and not by...

206
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,720
Asking on the podcast.

207
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,100
Wishing it into existence on the podcast.

208
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,260
Definitely done that before.

209
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,280
Exactly.

210
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,940
Because we're good people.

211
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,380
Yeah, but as a programme person, you know, it winds me up something chronic.

212
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,940
Indeed.

213
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,280
I'm not a member.

214
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,080
Ah!

215
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:15,640
so uh we're gonna talk about some other forthcoming conventions as this episode drops the next

216
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:23,420
imminent conventions are bristol con world fantasy con which is in brighton and armada con which is

217
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,860
in plymouth so um if you're not already planning to go then it might be a bit late although maybe

218
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,360
not you might still be able to get your act together and head to those but if you do please

219
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,460
write in and let us know what you thought of them and we're already we're always very interested to

220
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,380
hear uh from listeners who go to conventions we're not going to so we can live vicariously through

221
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,680
you i've never been to plymouth so you know just write and tell us about plymouth if you like

222
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:55,700
i've been to plymouth liz uh i went to see the world fireworks championships oh well yeah i can't

223
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,080
of what year it was the British Firework Championships I've been to see the British

224
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,640
Firework Championships I saw the World Firework Championships when they were on Scaveling Beach

225
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:13,480
in 1990 right next door to the Worldcon which was also in Scaveling in 1990 so that was very exciting

226
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,860
that is quite a good co-location it was if any future people are thinking about Worldcon bids

227
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,380
and want to look up the calendar yeah yeah yeah because you could just we all went down to the

228
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,480
each to watch fireworks at the night and that was one of the things that was good about the Dutch

229
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:34,100
Walk-On. The other thing that was good about the Dutch Walk-On was the Rice Staffel. I remember we

230
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,000
went to see the British Firework Championships were in Plymouth I think almost every year and

231
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,780
when I went there was square fireworks and I don't know how you do that but it was very good.

232
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,500
Ooh yeah they had all sorts of magical stuff in 1990 but I mean that was

233
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,360
that was a very long time ago so it probably wouldn't be quite so magical now.

234
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,020
I believe Bristol Con is happening the day after I get back from cottaging.

235
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,380
So I think, so Hispania is going, but I am not.

236
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,319
So maybe she will write in and tell us all about it.

237
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,459
Rare opportunity to hang out with Hispania without having to also talk to John.

238
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,319
Yeah.

239
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,480
I mean, it is a pretty big, pretty big opportunity.

240
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,420
That was a bit mean, but I thought it was funny.

241
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,939
So I thought you were just like noting entirely seriously that this was a good opportunity for listeners.

242
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,060
I was going to say, we talked a little bit last time about Pictcon and Novicon, which are both in the same week in mid-November.

243
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,580
Pictcon is in Perth and is being run by Pharah and looks to be quite successful.

244
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,740
Pharah who?

245
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,580
Pharah Mendelssohn. Pharah tells us that it has met its membership targets, so that's quite good.

246
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,440
And Novicon, I think lots of people are going to be at Novicon, including John and me, but not Liz.

247
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,500
we will be doing octothop live and we will have a stunt liz on sunday morning and we've been

248
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,420
promoted we are not in the off-piece program this time we are in the main program we're very excited

249
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,820
yes and our stunt liz befits the change of locale yeah that's what i was going to say i think it's

250
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,020
not so much that we've moved into the main program because octothop is more popular than it used to

251
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,300
be it's more that our stunt Liz is more popular than we are our stunt Liz is I would argue more

252
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:27,640
popular than Liz oh oh that's harsh I can tell you that I am I am hopping mad that I don't get to be

253
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,800
on the podcast with the person who is stunt me yeah that was Tommy Ferguson right also I I mean

254
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,879
I think it says more about the stunt Liz is a profile than it does about Liz's profile I didn't

255
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,780
think i was being too mean but um but yeah sorry liz it's fair i was quite mean about you john

256
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,240
uh but yes we will be doing we were doing uh ultra thought live which will be on sunday morning

257
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,460
because we didn't actually say we just mentioned it and then didn't say anything about it last

258
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,320
episode uh so it's good that we've mentioned it again this episode but yeah that will be good

259
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,019
have we got we got another episode before that because we can just drop progressively more hints

260
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,100
about who the stunt leader is.

261
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,040
I think there's going to be one more episode, isn't there?

262
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,000
I think so, yeah.

263
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,360
Otherwise, I am also on programme.

264
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,800
There's a panel about Morris dancing,

265
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,420
which might actually involve a workshop on Morris dancing.

266
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,420
I think the full details of this have not been worked out yet,

267
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,320
but there will be sticks.

268
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,840
So that's my other programme item at Novicon.

269
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,640
Excellent.

270
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,020
I think I'm moderating some mathematicians.

271
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,140
One of the mathematicians, I believe, is Nicholas Jackson.

272
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,180
But I don't know if the programme's set in stone yet,

273
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,560
so I shan't say too much more in case it's in flux.

274
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,660
Oh, no, maybe I shouldn't say.

275
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,800
Maybe I should say that next time.

276
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,020
I'm sure that...

277
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,840
No, we're wetting the listener's appetite, Alison.

278
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,300
It's good.

279
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,620
We're getting them excited.

280
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,820
There will be something about Morris dancing, I'm pretty sure.

281
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,360
Yeah.

282
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,080
Even if it's just Alison drunk in the bar.

283
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,160
Taking a Melodian with me.

284
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,760
I don't normally take Melodians to conventions for obvious reasons.

285
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,840
not for not for any program item she just wants to hold a melodion it's not just also playing it

286
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,960
they're quite loud you know i do know oh yeah no you would know wouldn't you i i keep forgetting

287
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,760
that you you were brought up in this community and did at one point one point uh make a brief

288
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,240
attempt to learn to play the melodion and then stopped probably to the you know happiness of

289
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,699
everyone in the same house then the other upcoming one which is a little bit further in the future

290
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,820
is Satellite 9.

291
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,980
So it is the 18th anniversary of Satellite this year, I believe.

292
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,460
It's been going for a while.

293
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,860
And I think it turned 18 as we record.

294
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,300
But the next convention is in May, so it will be 18 and a half.

295
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,560
Old enough to drink.

296
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,220
I am also planning to go to Satellite.

297
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,860
That's the plan.

298
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,900
It's not very organised yet, but that is our plan.

299
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,280
I'm looking forward to it.

300
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,900
It should be good.

301
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,420
It's a lot closer to me than it used to be.

302
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:07,140
That's not because they've moved venue to the Clayton Hotel in Glasgow, it's because I've moved venue from Southampton to Newcastle, which is quite a lot further north.

303
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:21,100
Those of you who attend WSFUS business meetings, which I assume is all of you who are listeners now since we've introduced you to them so much,

304
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:29,100
you may notice at the end of the WSFUS business meeting agenda are financial reports from all the past WorldCons and NASFICs,

305
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,320
which I suspect most of you have not read.

306
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:37,180
So we thought we would go through some of them and pull out what we think is of interest about convention finances,

307
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,600
because we may be slightly more interested in convention finances than a lot of you.

308
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,240
It's not impossible.

309
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,380
I find it interesting, right?

310
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,060
If you want to know how much money it costs to put on a Worldcon,

311
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,180
we generally put out a big public thing about how much money it costs to put on a Worldcon.

312
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,980
Some conventions break it down into a lot of categories, some don't.

313
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,180
But I think we're probably a little bit more public about the funds that are needed

314
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,500
than some kind of cons of equivalent size.

315
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,260
Yeah, I'd agree with that.

316
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,120
I think that's probably true.

317
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,020
But yeah, and there are some interesting things.

318
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,260
So one thing is that you have to keep or you're supposed to keep sending accounts until you have spent all your money.

319
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:28,200
And I noticed that Sasquan, who did pretty well in 2015 because they had a lot of supporting members because we're going back to sad puppy times, still have over $20,000.

320
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,200
And last year they spent $500.

321
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,580
So at this rate, they're still going to be sending reports to the World Cup until about 2065.

322
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:42,300
it sounds like they might just be putting all their money basically into a scholarship fund

323
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,880
for sending people to com-running conventions which is good but maybe you should just do this

324
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,520
at this point and not have to send in accounts every year yes i mean i think there's a general

325
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:59,000
point here which is that well-organized one-off events wrap up their finances and close their

326
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:07,540
books and are done with it in reasonable time keeping chunks of money around yes they fester

327
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,260
right stuff happens to the prime candidates for things not going in a good direction yeah and i

328
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:24,060
in an ideal world i think if you want to um if you want to have this money go forward for longer

329
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,160
You do something like the 2005 Worldcon did,

330
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,780
where they gave a lot of the money to the League of Fan Funds to get that started.

331
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,480
And that meant that that convention could wrap up,

332
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,440
but the money could continue to be used.

333
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,640
There's no reason you can't form a subsequent organization

334
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,260
called the Spakan Conrunning Support Company or something

335
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,340
and have that take the funds from the Worldcon,

336
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,160
but that would let you wrap the Worldcon up

337
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,220
in a way that just having it go infinitely is not quite as good.

338
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,520
Well, they have given all their funds to the parent organization.

339
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,400
So, I mean, part of this also is I do not fully understand

340
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,760
how US convention finances work and all this stuff you have to do to be like 501c.

341
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,780
But it sounds like they have basically got a parent organization

342
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,760
and SaskOne now doesn't exist.

343
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,300
The parent organization has the money, but they still fill out reports.

344
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,620
So possibly they're just doing this because they're very conscientious

345
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,280
and you could say, look, we gave the last bits of it to this other organisation, they're doing it.

346
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,680
But maybe we should have a thing saying like, once you get down below like, you know, $20,000,

347
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,000
you can just submit a final report and be done.

348
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,840
But that seems strange because, you know, things like the trip report bounties that are given by

349
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:44,260
Skiffy, that money is funds from an old Worldcon that ended up back with Skiffy for that purpose.

350
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,140
They're not still reporting that through the Worldcon business meeting.

351
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,420
but they do say that they keep the sasquan fund separate from the rest of the seattle westacon

352
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,860
committee so maybe that's why so i guess it's nice they did send a report because uh like san antonio

353
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,520
did not send a report and mid-american 2 did not send a report possibly they have finished

354
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,280
i didn't go back far enough to check if they sent something in previous years so they didn't send

355
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,260
anything in 2024 so probably they they're done and finished mid-american 2 did but they only had

356
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,680
five thousand dollars so probably they're done and finished as well yeah and so there was not a more

357
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,900
updated version of the agenda that i could find i could be missing one but there were no reports

358
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:33,980
from con zealand or from chengdu submitted to 2025 um they did submit reports to 2024 and of the end

359
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,059
of 2024 con zealand had an amount of money which i'm just gonna have to go and convert because i

360
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,940
think this might be in New Zealand dollars. Okay. So I cannot do any sort of conversion from New

361
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:54,600
Zealand dollars to like regular dollars or pounds in my head. That's fair. Yeah, about half, aren't

362
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,140
they? Yes, they're about half. Okay. Yeah, 43p. So as of the end of 2024, Con Zealand appeared to

363
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:08,820
have about 140,000 pounds left. That's quite a lot. That's a lot compared to how much money is spent

364
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,980
on science fiction fandom in New Zealand.

365
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,260
Presumably, I don't know for a fact,

366
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,640
but I assume that because it was literally impossible to hold the event,

367
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:27,380
they got refunds and were allowed to wriggle out of contract commitments.

368
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,120
So maybe that reflects the fact that they had some money

369
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,480
that didn't need to go to the venue.

370
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,480
I don't know.

371
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,340
Intriguing.

372
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,000
I think I remember that there was quite a lot of uncertainty

373
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,420
and so they probably kept a lot in reserve in case they had to pay out for certain things they

374
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:51,920
contractually obligated to but at this point yeah they gave quite a chunk of money to Glasgow 2024

375
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,460
but we don't know what they've done with it since so yeah it's just generally interesting that

376
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,660
they're obviously cons that made um you know have ended up with quite a big surplus and some of them

377
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,380
like Dublin 2019 have kind of slowly passed it out for good causes and wound down and they are done.

378
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,560
Whereas 2020 still has quite a lot left to go.

379
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:18,480
I think last time we looked, the 2020 Eastercon also had quite a lot of money sitting around as a surplus.

380
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,020
So we're not sure what's happened to that.

381
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:28,240
So, I mean, we're on the same theme here, but of interest is that Chengdu also did not submit accounts to 2025.

382
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,160
And their accounts are interesting because they show that, you know, Glasgow declined their pass along, but they did then basically, I think, give extra pass along to Seattle.

383
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,040
And their accounts look pretty standard.

384
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,940
But the main thing that's of interest to Chengdu is that they've managed to get $132,000.

385
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,020
And I say dollars because they're basically $132,000 overseas.

386
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,840
And then I think about $900 in China.

387
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:06,780
So this is probably because of all the difficulty of moving money back and forth and how many memberships ended up in being bought overseas and ending up in the US somewhere.

388
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:14,080
But basically, we just ended up with this big surplus, which is sitting in somewhere in the US, presumably, which must be an interesting accounting challenge.

389
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,000
They could use it to pay Dave McCarty's legal fees.

390
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:25,780
Maybe they could use it to just, you know, buy a load of new trophies and pack them all individually into...

391
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,840
Maybe someone could hand-carry each one over in first class.

392
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh yeah, I can imagine how dispatching a bunch of people to China to smuggle things back from China to the US in the current climate.

393
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,380
I mean, I just think there might be the odd logistical problem there, Liz.

394
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,420
I'm not saying you're smuggling it, I'm just saying you carry it. Have you never carried anything weird on a plane, John?

395
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,360
yeah but do you want the risk of having i don't know i don't know i guess my point is i'm not sure

396
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,660
i'd want to explain that to the ice agents or whoever it is at the border no fair enough you'd

397
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:04,380
probably have to send a u.s citizen yeah but yes no it does seem like a lot of money and i i imagine

398
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,440
there are some quirks with how that money needs to be dispersed but i wonder where that money has

399
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,860
gone in china like i wonder where the chinese pots have gone is that related in the documentation

400
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,840
um i don't think there are large pots of money i think the chinese world can't cost a lot more

401
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,640
money than the amount of money it raised in ticket sales maybe maybe that's the answer i mean if you

402
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,200
look where they've been spending things like um i mean these are the 2024 accounts we don't have

403
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:42,180
2025, they gave $60,000 of pass along to Seattle. So they're obviously doing well enough that they

404
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,220
were planning to send 30 to both, I think. And there's quite a lot of stuff on there about trophy

405
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,240
shipping and customs, which were presumably incurred after the con. Yeah. So I can't really tell where

406
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,360
all the, like where in particular money went right. It's not like these things are incredibly

407
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:03,360
detailed. And so the nice thing in 2025 is that Glasgow's account is not only their accounts,

408
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,820
but quite a long note about how they plan to disperse their remaining funds.

409
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,180
So I thought this was quite interesting because basically they're saying,

410
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,860
if you would like some money to sort of, you know, fund something that needs some seed funding,

411
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,920
you want bursaries to attend con running activities,

412
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,000
you want to need seed funding for an event or to do a publication

413
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,320
or to improve inclusiveness at fan activities,

414
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,060
then they will take applications for spending small amounts of funding on that,

415
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,180
which I think is a really good idea.

416
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,080
And they've also said like how they will judge it as well.

417
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,000
So I think that's quite nice and transparent.

418
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,200
And it will be nice to see what they come up with in future years.

419
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,800
And when they kind of say, okay, well, actually here are the 10 things we spent small amounts on in the next few years.

420
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,600
They also have very detailed accounts if anyone wants to dig a bit more into what the accounts look like for a WorldCom.

421
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,680
Except they're so detailed that now I can't find out how much money they've got.

422
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,660
It's good to have process.

423
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:13,420
Like, it's good to make it clear, because I think if you don't have process and if you don't have a process people can follow, it would be very easy to disperse all of these funds to people who are already known to the higher ups.

424
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:21,280
And I think this way, groups who might not be as known or who might have been inspired by Glasgow can potentially read this and be like, oh, we could apply.

425
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:29,880
I mean, I guess the counterpoint to that would be, I don't know how many people are reading the WUSFUS financial reports, but I think it's better than not.

426
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,160
I mean, I think it's a lot better than not having these procedures written out.

427
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,260
So that's really good.

428
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,820
Yeah, I mean, I presume the main person reading these financial things is me at this point.

429
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,300
Liz, what money are you applying for?

430
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,480
It does say that they should be focused on UK and EU con running.

431
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,020
So sadly, I cannot apply to fund the Bangkok Convention.

432
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,720
And that's it.

433
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,020
Basically, there's like Buffalo Nasfik, but I don't care about that.

434
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:07,860
One of the things that Glasgow have done with their surplus is that they have put together a bursary scheme for Smofcon.

435
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:16,280
So I applied to that and I've got some money to go to Smofcon, which is very lovely because I probably wouldn't be able to justify it without that.

436
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,420
And so I'm off to Sweden.

437
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,300
And yeah, I'm looking forward to sort of working on all that.

438
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:32,540
Listeners might. I think I mentioned on a previous podcast where I was intending to work with Tammy Coxson on the Hugo team.

439
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:44,520
But I've stepped down from that because I don't think I'll have time to do that and some professional commitments and also be a Clark Award judge and work on programme.

440
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,600
So unfortunately, something I had to give.

441
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,700
But I'm looking forward to talking to people about programme and stuff at SmothCon very much.

442
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,620
It will be good.

443
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,540
I'd love to be able to go to SmothCon, but I think it's just not quite happening for us this year.

444
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,960
I did love the one in Lisbon, and I'm sure the one in Stockholm will be equally lovely.

445
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,600
There may be a bit colder and darker.

446
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,840
We can always sneak in a discussion of seasons.

447
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,340
Oh, always.

448
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,720
Even when Liz says, it's dark here, don't get distracted.

449
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,760
We can manage.

450
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,380
Sorry, I got distracted by something and wasn't really listening to you.

451
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,760
Or did you get distracted by more financial details, Liz?

452
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,080
Yeah, I wondered if I was missing an updated one, but I wasn't missing an updated version.

453
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,380
Of which one?

454
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,880
Well, I wondered if there was a new version of the Seattle report, which might have some

455
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,940
future stuff in, but the note actually is on Glasgow saying they added something which

456
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,380
I could see.

457
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,900
So, nope, I apologize if I have missed an updated one that one of your treasurers submitted

458
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,140
after the business deadline, but I can't find it.

459
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,040
that is fair yeah it's it's it's interesting to read them because you one you get to see

460
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,420
an idea of how much it actually costs to put on world cons and where all the money goes and also

461
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,760
an idea of like how differently they sort of approach spending their surplus funding yeah

462
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,740
thank you very much for doing that deep dive liz it was honestly my pleasure although john is going

463
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,299
to court to smothcon so what are you two volunteering for over the next while allison's

464
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,520
doing Eastcon merchandise. Doing a little bit of Eastcon merchandise, but I'm also doing the

465
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,659
newsletter for Eastcon, not that we've actually sorted out any of the details yet. I might also

466
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:35,020
not be volunteering for LA. I'm having a think about it. I keep finding things that I have

467
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,300
volunteered to do and go, oh, I'll tell you one thing I'm volunteering, which is that I have been

468
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,280
past part of the archive for a very long running APA, and I am in the process of scanning that.

469
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,440
And as always with scanning, it turns out to be significantly more trouble than you think it's going to be.

470
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,260
So there's 300 issues and I have scanned two and a half of them so far.

471
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,840
That. So you are a solid 0.8% of the way through.

472
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,100
Yeah, something like that. Don't tell me that. It'll just distress me.

473
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,800
Oh, sorry. Ignore that I said that.

474
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,080
No, no, no. It's fine.

475
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,520
When you get to this bit in the edit, just put your fingers over your ears.

476
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:24,380
No, I'll cover my ears. No. So I got so far with it and went, oh, no, this is clearly going to be more work than I thought it was.

477
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,140
I mean, I knew it was going to be quite a bit of work.

478
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:35,480
I mean, I'm hoping that the process that is currently extremely non-automatic will become much more, much more automatic once I've got the hang of it.

479
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,080
But at the moment, it's taking a lot of fiddling.

480
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:45,380
I think all of this is evidence that I've been doing too many different things and should probably not do as many things.

481
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,400
And the way to do that is to not do as many things.

482
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,280
I advise not doing anything. It's very relaxing.

483
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,780
Yeah, that.

484
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,480
Shall we do picks? Liz, did you do any reading on holiday?

485
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Yeah. Guess what? I'm going to pick a book.

486
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:15,280
before you pick your book tommy picked a sequel to a previous liz pick so he did have you got any

487
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,400
messages for tommy or um you know thoughts on the sequel uh he's a man of good taste but i haven't

488
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:28,120
read the sequel yet so no but it was framed from you two as uh oh nick harkaway that's someone i

489
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:34,080
should get around to reading and i my comment is yes you're only like 15 years late onto the nick

490
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,340
carquay bandwagon there's no there's no time that's too late to get acquainted with a good

491
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,760
author that's true i've read the second um speaking of previous picks i have read the second robert

492
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:51,440
robert jackson bennett a drop of corruption also liked it a lot continue to like the series

493
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,560
fortunately that is not my pick it is one of the books i own holiday but i wasn't about to pick it

494
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,279
which is good because i couldn't could i yeah you could have i just not have said that you do you

495
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,780
we'd have taken that bit out and then you could have picked it and then i'd have gone oh by a

496
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:10,960
strange coincidence i'd also say that i mean i can't pick this because john basically picked it

497
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:18,560
but i did read the third agent chaykoski book in the time philosophers it's good isn't it i mean

498
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:24,760
it's hard read but i'm enjoying it it's very good it's best one i think i just want i just want

499
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,260
everyone i i it's really difficult to read because oh my god there are a lot of people making a lot

500
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,440
decisions in that book yes but i love where it is going or where i think i think it is going anyway

501
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:43,940
but no spoilers so that's very good and you should read it and then nominate for things but actually

502
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,860
i'm going to pick a book that i did not think i would like but i did so i'm going to pick it

503
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:58,020
as part of my trip for why i was missing last time i took a train overnight a mere 16 hours

504
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:04,500
and basically on that train I read an entire giant fantasy book. Giant fantasy books especially

505
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,480
the first book in a series which is all about an empire where there is mysterious competition going

506
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,160
on for who gets to be the next emperor and they're all from like different houses represented by

507
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:23,680
different animals and there's going to be intrigue and collusion between different candidates and

508
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,400
lots of trials and then the last one will obviously be surprise ending or something

509
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,000
which sounds very much like not my type of thing but actually it's great so i read the raven scholar

510
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,960
by antonia hodgson which i think is a debut novel and is the first of the eternal path trilogy but

511
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,180
yeah it is a an empire where the idea is that empire emperors are term limited and then there

512
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:49,100
is a competition by kind of the best warriors from each of the different houses to decide who replaces

513
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,980
the emperor but it's actually really really good there's lots of intrigue it's a very smart

514
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:02,820
protagonist i really like that kind of the protagonist is really good morally good or

515
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:08,340
well written well written because she basically she is from one of the lower classes and has risen to

516
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,920
a great height and therefore like a lot of people dislike her for that even though she's really good

517
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,840
at her job which would make her insufferable if she were not also an extremely fallible protagonist

518
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,620
who is aware of the choices she has made to get there

519
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,700
and that this is not a case of everyone was against her

520
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,260
so she did all the right things to prove them wrong.

521
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,720
It's like everyone was against her

522
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,000
but some of the things she's done,

523
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,460
you can see why they think she is kind of cutthroat

524
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,360
getting her way to the top.

525
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,980
So I did really like the protagonist

526
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,180
and if you don't,

527
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,100
then you're not going to want to read

528
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,120
a 650-page fantasy book about them.

529
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,580
That, yeah, fair.

530
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,260
But also there is like a murder mystery

531
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,260
going on in the background

532
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,600
and I like fantasy murder mysteries

533
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,740
and the murder mystery is strong enough

534
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,020
to be an interesting part on its own

535
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,720
and what kind of the plots

536
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,580
and all the clues that get unraveled from that

537
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,480
mean that kind of the contest is a little less

538
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,540
the contest becomes less important

539
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,800
than figuring out what is going on

540
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,700
at the heart of the empire

541
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:07,980
Cool

542
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,100
And it kind of comes to a conclusion

543
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,880
I'm sure there are going to be

544
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,820
books two and presumably two and three

545
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,660
and how many

546
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,540
but I think if you only read one

547
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,600
you would probably be satisfied.

548
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,040
I think that's a sign of a good first

549
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,640
a good first

550
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,480
instalment in a trilogy, right?

551
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,420
Like it should probably work as its

552
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,320
own book as well as the

553
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,420
first part of the trilogy. That sounds neat.

554
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,400
It is very long. I mean

555
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,360
a little bit too long, but I regularly

556
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,460
say that 300 page books are too long and this is

557
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,340
a little bit too long but not like 400 pages

558
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,040
too long, so. Yeah, it's fair.

559
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,720
Yeah, that's reasonable.

560
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,920
Alison, do you want to do your pick?

561
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,880
I am picking Here East

562
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:54,120
which is an area of East London it's not quite Stratford it's about a 20 minute walk from the

563
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,340
Stratford stations and it's about 10 minutes walk from Hackneywick and it is served by

564
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:06,040
exactly one corporation bus and and kind of a local it runs its own bus service where it

565
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,900
gleefully says you have to pay even if you have a London transport travel card so we didn't try it

566
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,020
we just kind of looked at it um here east has a lot of interesting things but i want to pick out

567
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:27,160
two one is the new v&a east storehouse which is the v&a's attempt to kind of explain to the public

568
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:33,780
what museum stores do and why they're a good thing when you hear that such and such a museum has a

569
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,980
million items in storage why that's not just a terrible idea they should sell it all off or give

570
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:46,740
it all back in the case of all the stuff that was acquired under strange circumstances. And they have

571
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:52,720
quite a lot of items on display. It kind of looks like a cross between the Ikea warehouse and the

572
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:59,040
final scene of the Raiders of the Lost Ark. They have some enormous installations in corners. So

573
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:05,640
you'll kind of turn a corner and instead of more crates, there will be like an enormous stage

574
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:12,960
backdrop or a piece of a Moorish palace roof and things like this. It is very strange, very

575
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,960
interesting, free, well worth going to have a look at and it also serves as a place where you can order

576
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:24,340
things from the V&A's catalogue to have a close look at. They don't actually make all of their

577
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,119
collection available for this purpose. The lady said oh the other things for storage that you

578
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:37,480
can't look at are in a vault which seems likely I am going back in a week or so to view a live

579
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:43,360
performance from the National Video Archive of Performance where they record theatre shows and

580
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,760
this is one which was not made available for DVD but I want to see it because I did not see it in

581
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:53,820
its live run and you can arrange to go and watch it at the V&A storehouse you know obviously they

582
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,520
could just send you a they could just send you a link but they don't do it that way they do it by

583
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:07,500
making it available in the vna east um and then we kind of had a wander around here east after

584
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:14,200
looking at that and came across a sign saying umbilical conrad shore cross free entry and you

585
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,320
know one of the things about wandering around places is it's always good to follow up signs

586
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:23,800
like that and see what it is the chap on the desk said do you know what this is and i said i think

587
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,480
It's an installation. And so it proved.

588
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:36,840
Shawcross is a sculptor, I guess, artist, who is fascinated by rope making machines and has been making successively larger ones.

589
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:50,280
And this one has some 250 spools of thread which are being formed into a massive rope that then trails across the floor in real time.

590
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,500
except when we actually went, it was not working.

591
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,860
It had broken earlier that day.

592
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,240
It is a commission from the University of Tasmania

593
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,320
and it's going to be shipped to the far side of the world.

594
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,500
So if you're a listener and you're in Tasmania,

595
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,760
you'll be able to see it next year.

596
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,780
But in the meantime, you can see it in its kind of trial run

597
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,120
in here east until the beginning of November.

598
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,100
So you've just got another week or so after this episode goes out

599
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,080
to go and have a look at that.

600
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,500
But I'm mentioning it.

601
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:23,520
I'm mentioning it because it appeared last week's cover art was the three of us,

602
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,180
Tommy, John, me and Tommy as Norns.

603
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,920
And the Norns are weaving the rope of fate.

604
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:34,900
And in this case, I made it to the rope from Conrad Shawcross's Umberleichel.

605
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,860
And it made no sense.

606
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:40,080
So I thought I better explain it on the podcast as part of my pick.

607
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,760
But well worth going to see if you like giant installations of semi-industrial art engines

608
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,020
making a point about something.

609
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,280
I'm not quite sure what.

610
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:56,340
But the idea is that it will spin rope forever, only requiring new spools once a year.

611
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,560
And the rope will gradually create a massive quantity of rope in this atrium in Tasmania.

612
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,080
So well worth seeing for nothing.

613
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,660
And there was also a pinball.

614
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:18,700
The other thing here East had was a pinball, an arcade bar called Four Quarters, where they would sell you 18 US quarters for £10, which is the worst exchange rate of all time.

615
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:24,020
And we played 18 quarters worth of pinball, which did not take us very long because we're not very good at pinball anymore.

616
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:30,960
Here East, a part of London, a new part of London, a new neighbourhood that's not quite finished yet.

617
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,300
That sounds very interesting.

618
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,580
And yeah, if I am in London, I might try and go and see it.

619
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,640
We shall see.

620
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,020
Is this the first time we've picked a neighbourhood?

621
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,720
I've picked an entire country.

622
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm not sure if I've ever picked a neighbourhood.

623
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:44,900
Could be, couldn't it?

624
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,700
I don't think I've picked a neighbourhood before.

625
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,500
No, I think you've picked, like, the control room of Battersea Power Station and so on.

626
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,300
Yeah.

627
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,280
I don't think I've picked a neighbourhood.

628
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,120
I might be misremembering.

629
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:57,920
John, you've got to pick.

630
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,260
I'm going to pick a video game.

631
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,820
I'm going to pick Tactical Breach Wizards,

632
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:09,780
which was one of the finalists for the Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work,

633
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,420
and is quite good.

634
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,460
So this is a game that is only available on PC, which is slightly annoying,

635
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,060
but I played on my little brother's laptop, which he gave me for free because it's knackered,

636
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,920
but it will play this, so that's good.

637
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:34,960
and this is a game in which you play wizards who are basically on a SWAT team and you play a turn

638
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:44,720
based game to try and defeat the enemies in various situations and do good stuff it's basically x-com

639
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:54,920
but with wizards and it's really fun and it's kind of also quite funny I did there were a

640
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:01,540
real especially there's a point in the game at which you start to play anxiety dreams so um

641
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,860
there's a mission for each character where you end up teaming up with yourself and you go through

642
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:13,340
missions with two of you and they're the anxiety dreams and in one of them um the character the

643
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:19,080
main character jen asks her dream doppelganger why she's being so mean to her and the answer is

644
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,240
because you're the only person you can't have any compassion for and um and i was like oh that's

645
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:31,100
that's quite real um but i like that very much start out with two playable characters who are

646
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:37,380
jen who is a witch who is very good at pushing people around quite literally uh and then you've

647
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:43,620
also got zan who can kind of do an overwatch sort of thing called predictive shot which is very

648
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:49,300
useful but he can also make clones of himself that kind of shimmer into life and then when they're

649
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,520
when they're shot they shimmer away again but you end up with this thing where you can start sending

650
00:47:53,740 --> 00:48:01,020
armies of clones or armies of like projections to their death because there's a couple of perks you

651
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,940
could unlock that let you do some really quite degenerate stuff which was very fun i just really

652
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:11,060
liked it it's it's funny it's kind of poignant um it's it's it's it's really the gameplay loop is

653
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,740
really solid um and yeah i just thought it was wonderful spent about 20 hours on it i think

654
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,520
and i'm kind of like oh they should do more of that because that was very good i don't know if

655
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,260
They will do more of that.

656
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:27,540
But if they did, I would probably play more.

657
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,880
So, yeah, I recommend it.

658
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,900
It was very good.

659
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:37,620
And I think Ed Moreland recommended it when we asked people to write in with Hugo's suggestions.

660
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,100
Must have been about six, eight months ago now.

661
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,340
So, yeah, thanks, Ed.

662
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:43,000
You were right.

663
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,340
Honestly, I think you could have just said, like, XCOM with wizards.

664
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,900
And I would have been like, yeah, all right.

665
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,680
I mean, it's fair.

666
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,220
It's fair.

667
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,760
So it's also on Steam Deck.

668
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,980
So you can play it on PC or Steam Deck.

669
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,640
Do you have a Steam Deck? No.

670
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,020
I do not. I have an old knackered laptop.

671
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,420
Is Steam Deck a Linux?

672
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:13,860
Steam Deck is, yeah, they're Linux machines that have like a open source translation layer on them that Valve contributes to.

673
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,680
Doesn't that mean you could put it on other Linux boxes if you were?

674
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,380
I mean, yeah, but I think we've talked about this on the podcast before.

675
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,440
Life is too short.

676
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,060
It was much easier to get an old knackered laptop off my brother and install it on that.

677
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah, I have an old knackered PC, but I'm not sure.

678
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,760
I think it might be too old for this purpose.

679
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,420
Yeah, I guess there's old and there's knackered and there's old and there's knackered.

680
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,740
So, yeah.

681
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,140
I was considering, well, I saw someone selling a secondhand Steam Deck

682
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:47,240
and was vaguely considering to get through the Steam backlog of games I don't play

683
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,560
because I don't have a PC anymore.

684
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:53,540
yeah uh yeah listeners if you have a steam deck and you really like it right in or if you hate it

685
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:58,760
right in as well but you know we're gonna get a lot of we're going to get a lot of letters liz and

686
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,220
you're going to read them out oh no i don't think that many of our listeners have a steam deck

687
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,660
do any of our listeners have a steam deck if you have a steam deck write in i bet ming does

688
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:13,100
at least one because someone wrote in about it didn't they that was the odd thought podcast

689
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,880
and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

690
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,700
no i mean i think the solution is to actually eat more carrots my eyesight is great john

691
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,140
because of shooting lasers into it yeah um but carrots are specifically for night vision right

692
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,060
and do the lasers help with night vision the lasers do not help with night vision to be fair

693
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:59,060
fact the opposite you know it's all a myth don't you what everything you are all figments of my

694
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:07,900
imagination carrot supporting your night vision may be propaganda ah it's big carrot so in the war

695
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,160
they wanted people to meet they wanted people to eat more carrots

696
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,240
listen carefully children auntie allison's talking about the war again

697
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,740
no no they wanted to eat more carrots so they did proper guarantee saying that carrots would improve

698
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:34,319
your vision and simultaneously they wanted the germans not to know how we were finding their

699
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:42,460
airplanes at night which was radar and so they put it about that the pilot's night vision was

700
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:47,680
being improved because of all the carrots that they ate that was not true it was radar i see

701
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:55,360
it's because it's because if you have if you don't have enough vitamin a you lose your night blindness

702
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,020
and carrots contain vitamin a so they don't let you i think there's like they don't let you see

703
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:05,680
like infrared but if you have a vitamin a deficiency they can help restore your night

704
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:12,760
vision from the vitamin a deficiency yes but anyway i'll give you a link the propaganda was

705
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:17,140
that it let you see like an actual cat which is untrue but then i don't think anyone seriously

706
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,340
thought that was true because i've never been able to do that and i've eaten carrots for a lot of my

707
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,500
life and i feel like if carrots did give you literal superpowers we would have noticed but

708
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,180
radar does is the point maybe i'm wrong um if i had if carrot if eating carrots gave me radar

709
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:40,380
then yes that would also be fair comment yes i have got i i have got a but if you are i guess

710
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,560
the key point is here if you are struggling enough that you need under bed lighting to get to the

711
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,780
loo in your hotel room you might need to eat some carrots because you might have vitamin a deficiency

712
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:54,820
or you might need to go to the optician okay i don't have vitamin a deficiency eat lots of carrots

713
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,500
but John, I'm 60 now.

714
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:00,040
Yeah, I was astonished by how much my,

715
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,400
the kind of edges of my vision knocked off in my 50s.

716
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,240
