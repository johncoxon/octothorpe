00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Did you know that Britain is 0.14 more democratic than Mauritius?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:23,360
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 115th episode of Octothorp.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,600
 This episode is coming to you on the 1st of August 2024.

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,040
 I'm John Coxon.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,840
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,280
 This is a pretty bumper episode because we're going to talk about the business meeting at Glasgow

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
 and about some aspects of the Glasgow Worldcon. There's quite a lot of discussion listeners,

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,160
 so we're going to do letters of comment at the end if we have time and we suspect we will not

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,120
 have time and we'll come back to it in episode 118. But please keep writing, we still love you.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,360
 So Glasgow, we're going to be at Glasgow listeners and we're going to do some programme.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,920
 So Octothorp has a table talk which is at 11.30am on Saturday the 10th of August and we have a

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,480
 live recording which is at 11.30 in the morning on Monday the 12th of August. And so if you would

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,440
 like to come to our table talk and just talk to us then please feel free to do so and then if you

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,560
 want to listen to us do the pod then you can do that as well. Hoorah!

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,720
 Please definitely come to our table talk if you are the sort of person who would not come

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,120
 and approach us in the bar. If you're happy approaching us in the bar you can do that pretty much any

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,920
 time. Whenever we're in the bar I don't know where that will be. Get a ribbon, if you're a listener

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,000
 we'll all have ribbons I think. Oh yes. So come and find us and say I'm too nervous to talk to you

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,600
 oh Octothorp people but can I have a ribbon. I'm on two panels, one about Ahsoka from the Star Wars

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,840
 universe and another about safety tools for tabletop role-playing games. We will be putting

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,080
 in the show notes the times and details of the panels but we won't be reading them out here

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,320
 because they'll be very dull listeners. Look at the show notes if you'd like to know when they are

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,840
 Alison and Liz what do you want at Worldcon? So I particularly want to plug the fan funds

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,400
 as the Guffin administrator and we're having an auction on Saturday night at 8.30 um do come along

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,640
 and bid on amazing things and there'll be a catalogue. There's also a reception for the fan

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,880
 funds that you're all welcome to come to on Thursday afternoon pretty much straight after the opening

27
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,040
 ceremony in the fanzine lounge which is being run by John's other half, this mania sheriff with

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,800
 help from my other half Stephen Kane so that should be a good place during the convention to hang out

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,040
 in the in in hall 4 which is kind of the big social hall at the convention. I am also on Thursday

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:46,800
 running a maker fanzine workshop for a Glasgow 2024 fanzine and then I am on some panels one on

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,240
 how to generate and increase your podcast. How do you keep your podcast exciting and

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,040
 build an audience and I mean obviously this is a spoiler but our answer to this is have a

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,000
 wuss for business meeting agenda with 50 items on it that we can talk about. I'm on a panel about

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,040
 history Scottish fanzines and I am on a panel about fanzine covers. I'd obviously love to see

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,280
 any of you at all of them. I'm not doing anything at Worldcon apart from the tabletop

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
 tabletop and the live podcast recording so if you want to see me at Worldcon that's where you can

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,480
 find me. Listeners I am in charge of making sure people on the Glasgow discord talk enough.

38
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,680
 This is a bit like having a czar in charge of water being wet in that I was quite worried about

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,400
 it before we opened the discord then the discord opened and I was like oh people are quite happy

40
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,280
 quite happy to talk on the discord as it turns out but I am running a couple of activities to

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,320
 encourage people into the discord. I'm running a play along of if we ran the zoo con which will be

42
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,800
 on on the discord as a choose your own adventure style thing with discord polls and I'm also running

43
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,360
 a scavenger hunt which by the time this episode drops both of those will be in full flow and

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,960
 for anyone who remembers our episode on if I run the zuc on I'm doing all different scenarios you

45
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,680
 will see different parts of the game please come and join. Yeah it's busy just go on innit.

46
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,520
 I want to give some credit the discord strongly encouraged people to post something about themselves

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,760
 in the members directory and they called it members directory to make it clear that you can

48
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,400
 go and look people up and see who they are if you're chatting to them about a thing.

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,600
 This is a really good idea or all phallish discord should do this I love it and it has led to a

50
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
 lot of people so you discover that people do all sorts of things and are coming from all

51
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,240
 different parts of the world in a very exciting way so it's good.

52
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:57,600
 Glasgow 2024 have removed 377 votes from the hugos because they believe that it was a coordinated

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,520
 act of vote stuffing by not real people a lot of people had obviously made up names when they

54
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,440
 purchased their wuss was membership and they have removed those votes and re tallied the

55
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,800
 category they have not they were all voting for a particular finalist they did not have

56
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
 evidence that that finalist was involved in the attempt to stuff the ballot so they have

57
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,720
 not removed them there's a full statement about this which you can see on will put a link to

58
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,320
 the statement on their website and it seems to have got to have fairly well as a statement of

59
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,120
 well this is clearly transparent and we're glad that you took this action and have told us that

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,000
 you've done it um we'll probably never know what exactly went down but people have been trying to

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,160
 work it out for from data that they have available to them all over the internet so if you're interested

62
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,760
 that you can follow the trail of tea leaves yes indeed we condemn the attempt to stuff the ballot

63
00:05:51,760 --> 00:06:00,560
 and we applaud Glasgow's robust transparent and decisive action in this matter yeah and they did

64
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,280
 a great thing as well which is that they started off by talking to the finalist concert to let them

65
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,000
 know that they were invalidating these votes and then they whole held a meeting with all of the

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,800
 hugo finalists has said you need to know about this before we release the press release which was

67
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,400
 i thought thoughtful unkind and it other that meeting had not just all of the wussfus division

68
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,800
 it but also um the chair and the promotions head and so on so it clearly took it very serious yes

69
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,120
 yes and exactly when like you know when you and when you announce this there is going to be a lot

70
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,160
 of speculation about who the person is or well who the finalist concerned is and you know that might

71
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,880
 spill over to other completely uninvolved finalists and so it's nice to give them a heads up to say

72
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,080
 look this is coming we want you to be aware before you read the press release along with everyone

73
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,680
 else in the world so thank you Glasgow who are generally being very nice to finalist yes

74
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:06,480
 at Glasgow there will be a series of incomprehensible meetings listeners if you

75
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,040
 have attended a world-con business meeting before you know what i'm talking about but if you are new

76
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,840
 to world cons or business meetings or science fiction family generally then we will never to

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,360
 explain no but people often believe if they're not into world cons that there is an elite shadow

78
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,840
 eacoball that controls the hugos and there is it's true and let us tell you all about it for two hours

79
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,960
 every day at the world con there is a meeting which lasts usually about three hours but this year

80
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,920
 will last five hours which basically does an awful lot of talking about how world cons should work

81
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:49,120
 and they use parliamentary rules to do this to make it as weird as it possibly can be and no

82
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,360
 i'm not exaggerating as much as you think if you've never been to one any any advances on that

83
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,760
 listen Alison i think it's worth saying look the business meeting lasts for quite long time

84
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,040
 but you are not obligated to go to all of it you are perfectly allowed as long as you can kind of

85
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,760
 sneak in and out quite relatively quietly to drop in and out of the business meeting when you happen

86
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,640
 to be free like don't feel it is only for people who can commit to attending you know 100% of the

87
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,760
 time it is okay to just pop in and out you might miss stuff you probably won't be able to time it

88
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,160
 so that if you want to see a particular thing be discussed you'll be there for it but it is okay

89
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,600
 to kind of you know participate in parts of it and not the full thing so if you want a gentle

90
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,480
 introduction you know you can go along one day and you don't have to stay for the whole five hours

91
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,280
 yeah and i think it's also important to note that you don't have to go at all if you don't want to

92
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,040
 like it is fine i'm not judging i will probably go to at least some of it because i care too much

93
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,600
 about some of this stuff more than it's healthy but yeah i'm not going to judge if other people

94
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,960
 quite reasonably decide they'd rather just have a nice convention it would be it would be interesting

95
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,040
 if some octa thought member turned out to be a stalwart of business meeting fandom a couple of

96
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,360
 years down the line octa thought listener i mean i'm sure there are some listeners who go to a lot

97
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,680
 of business meeting stuff and but i don't think there's many who are going to challenge us on it

98
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,720
 being kind of very difficult to know what's going on world con have published the business

99
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,200
 meeting agenda you want to hear what christopher j garsia's thoughts were on this i've put a link

100
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,200
 to his deep dive into his opinions on each of their um agenda items um and if anyone knows of

101
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,400
 any other deep dives along those lines please let me know and i will amend the show notes to include

102
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,680
 them on a previous episode which was probably either episode 95 or 96 but the show notes are

103
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,880
 inadequate nor he passed john we discussed the chengdu business meeting and uh day from karti's

104
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,800
 last minute surprise uh to invalidate online uh or to invalidate any attempt to take the business

105
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,080
 meeting online in future world cons um there are resolutions that are a direct result of him

106
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:12,320
 doing that and those resolutions are c1 c3 c4 and you're already having fun listeners yeah i mean

107
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,000
 there's just going to be an hour of this now so by all means we'll see you in Glasgow

108
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
 come to our table talk if you're currently not enjoying this it won't get better

109
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,320
 that the auger thought guarantee and at our table talk we promise not to talk about the

110
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,160
 weswesfus business meeting we do not promise not to talk about the weswesfus meeting guys

111
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,600
 c1 basically says you can try and post the pwn emotion indefinitely at the main business

112
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,680
 meeting the first time it's brought and that would change it from it only being possible at

113
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,600
 the preliminary business meeting um so it's basically another opportunity to get things off

114
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,120
 the agenda if you don't think they should be on the agenda c3 restricts a business that can be

115
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,920
 submitted by surprise effectively it would mean you can't do it without unanimous consent and c4

116
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,040
 which i think is the one i want to discuss most is the amendment to the standing rules that would

117
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,320
 basically remove standing rule 7.9 and i think we all know that that is the rule on proxy and

118
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:14,320
 remote voting and so it would explicitly strike that and would allow proxy voting again and thus

119
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,840
 move in the direction of remote participation which i as anyone who's listened to an episode of

120
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,120
 what i thought before and god if this is your first one i'm so sorry but i enthusiastically

121
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,280
 support this motion go back and listen to the last episode it was better or the next one that

122
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,520
 will be better with my slight parliamentary hat on i'm going to point out that these are

123
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,160
 divided into two categories ones which are about not letting this sort of thing happen again

124
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,440
 and the one which is about repealing the thing that got done last year

125
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,040
 yeah it shouldn't have happened nothing a change is big as they shouldn't have happened without

126
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:54,480
 ratification um we've talked about it before and so i'm very much in favor of um the repeal one and

127
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,600
 i don't care what was it what what was just us to sort it out i'm less excited by the by the

128
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,240
 nuts and bolts of making business meetings work than the others are yeah i'm in favor of these let's

129
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,320
 repeal things so we can at least try a virtual business meeting if it turns out to be terrible

130
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,320
 then we can have another opinion on it but i think at this point we've got at least try to you know

131
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,800
 reach the 20th century yep oh 21st century probably i don't think they were doing remote

132
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:32,560
 business meetings in like 1901 and c4 segues into a number of motions which are targeted at

133
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:43,280
 changing the way the business meeting works so d9 would set up a study group to review the rules

134
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,480
 over participation in the business meeting it would assess alternatives to rules of order

135
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,120
 it would assess remote participation and it would assess whether or not it's possible to schedule

136
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,160
 the business meeting separately from the world con and then f14 and 15 would bring in popular

137
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,080
 ratification so instead of things being ratified by the next business meeting they would be ratified

138
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,880
 by popular votes so the next work on would run a popular virtual then we put the same way that the

139
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,000
 movie one is doing are we going to talk about the movie yeah we talked about in this one at least

140
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:27,040
 90 days before the first preliminary business meeting um so so yes in the run up and then f15

141
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:35,200
 basically sets up secondary business meetings and they would be online business meetings that would

142
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 happen as well as the primary business meeting which would be the business meeting we currently

143
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,040
 have so what do we think about these i mean i think first i think they're not going to get

144
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,120
 debated this year because there is too much debate in the business meetings i think we should know

145
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,920
 that the business meeting timings have changed from being the usual 10 to 1 p.m to being 10 a.m to 3 p.m

146
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,720
 a Glasgow so that is like 20 hours of business meeting or i guess more importantly if you want

147
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,080
 to be there and taking part that is like your entire days basically spent in the business meeting

148
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:15,360
 it is i think too much and something has to change i quite like popular ratification but i'm i'd be

149
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,680
 interested to see how this kind of test vote at Glasgow works first um if you are not a Glasgow

150
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,960
 member or haven't done this yet they're basically holding a sort of popular vote on where you can

151
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,880
 vote yes or no to ratification of one particular bit of business passed on from Chengdu which is

152
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,440
 the independent film categories in the hugos and then they will report back did people vote in it

153
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,480
 did they vote yes did they vote no i think that will give us an indication of how like a popular

154
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,640
 ratification vote might work and so then we can use that to decide how we feel about popular

155
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,520
 ratification more generally which i think i'm kind of in favor of it brings in the whole membership

156
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,360
 rather than a few but i can also see problems with it people are very worried about popular

157
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
 ratification for all the reasons that people worry generally about referendum and popular

158
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,760
 democracies i'm actually i've taught quite a lot of people including quite a lot of people who

159
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,280
 are not bussifers nerds about the indie film vote and i'm quite encouraged by what i'm hearing

160
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,240
 because people are reading the statements and and drawing conclusions i think are reasonable about

161
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,240
 them so i'm hoping that will be reflected in the vote yeah i think in general i'm pro popular

162
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:34,480
 application and i'm deeply against f15 which is the um secondary business meeting idea because

163
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,520
 i think the reason to have the business meeting online is so that it can eventually take the

164
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,280
 business meeting away from the world con and have it separately so that people don't have to take

165
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,480
 time out of their world con to do it and i think this would explicitly mean that the world con one

166
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,960
 was was given primacy over any online participation and i have a severe philosophical objection to that

167
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,480
 and i like d9 because d9 basically says why don't we go away and try and form consensus and come back

168
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,280
 with a single care and proposal and i like that more of that yeah i don't believe we can ever form

169
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,800
 consensus on this issue but i think a study group is probably the only sensible way forward here

170
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,600
 i think all of the proposals on this agenda that essentially offer a solution

171
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:29,520
 queueing out of cloth by one faction oh i i i'll never gonna be the way and we need to do a little

172
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,760
 bit better do we want to go from here to independent film if you are a wussfus member Glasgow has

173
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:44,160
 written to you to invite you to vote in a consultative vote on the two independent film new hugo

174
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,000
 categories that were got their first pass last year in chen do and are up for ratification this

175
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,280
 year the deadline for voting will have gone by the time you listen to the podcast but we did want to

176
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,080
 talk about it briefly both because it represents the way forward for as i said a trial run for the

177
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,640
 popular ratification proposal but also because we as have mentioned before we have

178
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,640
 thinks about these hugos which is that while we're not averse to independent film is some way

179
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,800
 being recognized these are not the right models because they're very very confusing when you go

180
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,960
 and vote you've got a little statement in favor from the proposals of the hugos and a statement

181
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:31,600
 against which was written by olav rocke and amanda wackarock friends of the podcast and

182
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,480
 which i thought was very good but it missed my favorite argument against

183
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,960
 these categories which is that they do not partition the hugos and we try where possible

184
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,840
 to make sure you can one thing that you do is only ever eligible for one hugo we don't always

185
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,080
 manage it but normally normally the hugos are pretty good about that and these did not do that

186
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,520
 i very much want these hugos not to get ratified so this is my big hope for the business meeting

187
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,680
 which i have to say i'll probably not be at any of though i was hoping to be at this bit of it so

188
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,400
 we'll see do you have anything to say on this i agree with alison i think i'm not necessarily

189
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,200
 against rewarding short cinema at the hugos and i think like a best dramatic presentation very short

190
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,800
 form would be fun like i'm not saying i think best dramatic presentation is perfect as is i just

191
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,120
 think this is deeply imperfect in a way that i don't think fixes any of my problems with the

192
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,320
 category and i think in practice most of the interesting cinema i would like to reward is short

193
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,800
 film so you could very easily achieve this by having a time-based definition that would do

194
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:40,240
 something very similar for short indie movies but yeah so i i am broadly against this one yeah i think

195
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,200
 what i would need to be positively in favor of this is a list over the past few years of things they

196
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:52,160
 think that would have been good nominees and finalists and then i can see whether it would

197
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,560
 have been at all feasible for me to see any of them because that's a problem you're trying to reward

198
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,440
 these these indie films which really don't get a lot of distribution and then it's like well if

199
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,680
 no one can actually watch them then it's going to be very hard for people to to nominate them

200
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,800
 so there's that i think i could also go with a very short film category but you've got to be

201
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,480
 careful to kind of have a big kind of a gap so that very short films go in there but it doesn't

202
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,920
 include like 22 minute episodes of animated shows if that's what you want to keep into short form

203
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,600
 so it's hard to kind of have a thing that gets the best of like indie sf short films but doesn't

204
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,480
 just get token over by like six episodes of lower decks or something yeah the other thing i think

205
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,800
 you could do is simply have a category which explicitly rules out episodes of television

206
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,480
 because i think it's relatively easy to define a television series in a rigorous way and that

207
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,160
 would be the other way of doing it yeah but i i feel like you'd be at risk from worldcon related

208
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,560
 youtube videos and things of that sort as well so you know i have two other things which are

209
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,760
 basically i don't know how easy it would be for Hugo voters to actually watch any independent

210
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,440
 short films because none of the film festivals really allow remote participation including sci-fi

211
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
 london which is the one written by one of the people that suggested this double category

212
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,520
 and was online during the pandemic and has gone back to not being online which is frustrating

213
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,840
 and the other thing is i'm not sure how aware the Hugo electorate are of independent cinema in a way

214
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,640
 that i i don't know whether it makes sense for our opinions like are we going to actually

215
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,960
 award any good stuff or is it going to be a category which has limited participation so i think the

216
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,720
 thing i would want to see is if we want to reward short independent films i would want the people

217
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:47,120
 who are advocating for that to work on educating the worldcon membership about those before trying

218
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,480
 to get it on the Hugo awards and doing it the other way around smacks of self-interest to me

219
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,480
 it feels like unfortunately this would be a great fit for an award where you had a jewellery

220
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,480
 nomination stage and then a popular vote final stage and that's not possible in the Hugo

221
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,960
 system at the moment we can change anything in the wistford's constitution if we try harder

222
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,360
 than maybe the episode i agree with everything that you've both said but i'd also like to add

223
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,000
 that one thing that the worldcons could be doing to promote short film is getting more of it on

224
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,320
 the program having a short film program having more stuff that's about short film and getting

225
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,080
 you know the world calls it a great place to find some great short films and and present them as a

226
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,760
 as a freebie for the members in advance and say we've chosen 10 excellent short films made in

227
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,720
 the city that we're in here go and look at them guys yeah there's nothing stopping a worldcon from

228
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,760
 having a kind of short film competition as part of what it does and i'd love to see that shall

229
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,440
 we move from here on to extended eligibility yeah and so speaking of independent cinema the

230
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,800
 wistford's constitution basically allows for what is called extended eligibility items that receive

231
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,000
 extremely limited distribution in the year of first publication or presentation the eligibility

232
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,800
 may be extended for next year by a two-thirds vote of the business meeting and so every year there are

233
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,120
 some resolutions for extending the eligibility usually of these kind of small and independent

234
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,560
 films which have had like a few showings at film festivals or maybe a limited release overseas

235
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,720
 and giving them an extra year and i am basically favor this i think in general maybe we should just

236
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
 say anything which only been released at film festivals you're getting extra year by default

237
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,880
 um but this year there's a couple that i think are really pushing the definition of limited

238
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:50,240
 availability and those are proposals to extend the eligibility of the boy in the heron and godzilla

239
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:58,400
 minus one both films which came out kind of at the end of 20 23 and my problem is this is that

240
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,880
 when they say did not receive wide theatrical release until late in 2023 this is true but the

241
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,680
 boy in the heron came out on december 8th and made 35 million dollars in the us and godzilla

242
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,200
 minus one came out on december the first and made 45 million dollars in the us by the end of 2023

243
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,760
 according to numbers that i fished out of box office mojo so that to me is not limited availability

244
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,400
 and also i think we should remember that we are not actually nominating on december 31st people

245
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,200
 can still be watching these films in january and february and nominating them and i think the

246
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,520
 really strong counter argument against this one is that poor things which is a finalist was you know

247
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,400
 also released in december in the us and made less money than either the boy in the heron or godzilla

248
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,000
 minus one and still made it onto the ballot so i argue that they were available enough that people

249
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,520
 could have nominated it and i think kind of this is stretching it quite a bit and we just end up

250
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,920
 with an eligibility extension where anything released in december in the us um on thousands of

251
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,720
 cinema screens could then be eligible for next year which i'm not sure it needs and it's the same

252
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,440
 because i really love godzilla minus one but i think it has burned its eligibility which let's

253
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,560
 be clear most smaller movies are released in december it's the normal time to release your

254
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,800
 awards darlings and then anyone who's seriously into film can see those on cinema screens in january

255
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,440
 and february in good time to nominate as liz says i think we'll look at we also get a fine for

256
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,000
 both the boy in the heron and godzilla minus one that people did nominate those movies in quite

257
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,240
 large numbers just not insufficient numbers to get on the ballot and really it's just saying

258
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,440
 can we have two bites of cherry for anything we like please and i

259
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,280
 can see the minus one was very good it would have been on my ballot if i'd seen it in 2023 but you

260
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,360
 know if they wanted me to see it in 2023 they could have released it in july i think the other

261
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,360
 thing liz said was i don't think it would be a bad idea so allison i think said this earlier in the

262
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,560
 episode which is she would like see the business meeting basically discuss far more as much as you

263
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,320
 can away from the business meeting that doesn't really need to be discussed at the business meeting

264
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,800
 and i think going through individual films being like was it only shown at a film festival it can

265
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,200
 be eligible in this year then like just make that put it in the constitution because as allison is

266
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,200
 remarked elsewhere that's how the oscars do it so why not the huco awards so some films get a very

267
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,440
 limited distribution in theaters specific in december like not two thousand screens like ten

268
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,160
 screens specifically so they will be eligible for the oscars in in that year um the the streaming

269
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,840
 first movies do this and the notion that we should be doing something totally different for

270
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,440
 for world cons is a bit weird also when we're talking about things that you could do

271
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,680
 by not by popular ratification this seems like an excellent example of something you could do

272
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,000
 by popular vote well in advance for the world con i just not have it trouble the world so there

273
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,520
 have been a bevy of um things brought to the business meeting about the huco awards as one

274
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:03,600
 might expect from what happened and last year d 10 would establish a huco process study committee

275
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,120
 which would think about the huco awards very hard and come back with some recommendations

276
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,320
 one of the things it would think very hard about is third party administration of the huco awards

277
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:24,160
 f5 basically says if you disqualify or move anything under the relevant section you would have to

278
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,720
 publish and explain that with the statistics f6 would basically make a huge number of amendments

279
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:37,280
 to introduce a body called wsa which i don't know what it actually stands for because i don't

280
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:45,200
 think they define the acronym no they don't but they they basically say this would be some

281
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,120
 independent body which would replace the mark protection committee and would administer the

282
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,280
 huco awards f7 would mean that you can't remove things it would add a new thing which means you

283
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,680
 can't remove a work for a reason not in the constitution unless required in local law

284
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,880
 and if it was required if it was done for that reason there would be a retrohugo five years

285
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,560
 afterwards f8 would is just terrible we'll go into why but it's a really really poor amendment

286
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,760
 and should die in a fire jon jon tell us what you really think f9 would let you disqualify

287
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,800
 huco administrators which i originally put in the show notes under the don't do that

288
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,800
 dave resolutions but moved later but it is basically a don't do that dave resolution as well and then

289
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:44,320
 f11 would establish a elected subcommittee which would do auditing of the site selection and huco

290
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,640
 award processes and report back to whether or not they were done properly or not any any

291
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,600
 disagreements with the way i've summed that up i just want to say that this section contains some

292
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,560
 of the my all-time least favorite was for business meeting agenda items and and there is no amount

293
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:09,520
 of pointy fire that is sufficient for some of them yeah so let's go so any of us any of us against

294
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,600
 having a committee i mean the whole point of committees is that why would you be against it so

295
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:20,560
 i'm pro committee i guess okay so committees are slow and people want blood now that's the argument

296
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,080
 against a committee it could take a few years for the committee to get to some sensible point

297
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,360
 look how long the load start up but now we do have the load start so you know it's okay but

298
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,760
 yeah no obviously we want to committee we're in favor of doing less action aren't we guys

299
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,880
 i was certainly don't like any of these other ones so yeah now i am in favor of a committee i

300
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,560
 just worry that committees are where things go to die and i think this year we might have potentially

301
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:52,960
 this committee a committee on like reforming the business meeting and a potentially a committee on

302
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,360
 the center resolutions and that might be just a lot of committees and not enough people to actually

303
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,040
 run them and do a lot of work in a year and report back and i fear this is dragging on and it might

304
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,600
 be like 2027 before we get anything but in general i think this is a good one to take to committee

305
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,400
 if only for the fact that there are like five different amendments submitted that all do slightly

306
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,320
 different things in slightly different ways and maybe we should pick one yeah so one of the things

307
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,760
 that i said i think it was me who said it but i think was said was said on the podcast anyway

308
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,480
 after Chengdu was like i want to see sort of widespread consultation in whatever the solutions

309
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,560
 are to these problems and then one of the problems i think is that there have been groups of people

310
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,240
 who have tried to talk to other people but they haven't had the breadth of scope to be able to

311
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,000
 talk to everyone and i think the advantage with the committee that's actually a part of the business

312
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,600
 meeting is that they could do things like ask the seated world con to distribute a consultation

313
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,160
 survey and so i think this is an imperfect way of getting what i want but i can't see a better way

314
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,960
 of getting what i want so i think i do support it while agreeing with Liz that i have worries about

315
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,160
 committees being where things go to die so yeah i think that's well well said Liz

316
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,240
 i do slightly worry about our ability to run good committees in this space that there's a there's

317
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,880
 not that many people who are that good at this stuff and they are already working pretty hard on

318
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,280
 on the business meeting stuff we've already got that's my only caveat though because i think

319
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,600
 this has to be a committee it's going to take a couple of years we just have to get it right

320
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,240
 and some of the other ones i'm also kind of looking at them with the angle of all right if this was

321
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,480
 in place last year what would it have done and i guess the illegal exclusions one would say

322
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:49,520
 we can run some retros in 2028 for certain categories in 2023 which i don't think would be great to be

323
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,760
 honest i don't really like the using of the retro hugos which were established to like fill gaps

324
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,680
 as a way to kind of make good on things we have subsequently messed up on if only because i think

325
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:09,680
 if you do that in 2028 so you rerun the 2023 you know astounding award in 2028 i think definitely

326
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:15,520
 the person who was excluded in 2023 is going to win weren't i'd also it is i think you would need

327
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:24,960
 to pass f8 to make f7 make any sense and that's basically the one where if you if you if you if

328
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:32,240
 you remove anyone from the ballot then the entire category is not run and it just it seems like

329
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,280
 an absolute mess and this is exactly why i'd like a committee to go away and think about it properly

330
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:44,560
 because i don't think this actually helps so i am against f7 and f8 on that basis yeah i think

331
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:51,440
 the risk of f8 is you disqualify someone without citing a clause the constitution or something or

332
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,200
 say you do disqualify someone and you made a mistake but you then basically say to the other

333
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,000
 finalists tough no order here and that seems a bit heavy-handed because it's not the other finalists

334
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,720
 fault i i i think it would create even more bad feeling towards the hugo awards from creators

335
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,200
 who are already pretty pissed off with us we skipped over f5 and f6 f5 is the one that stipulates

336
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,520
 that you have to publish your disqualifications but it says that you have to publish them with the

337
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:28,080
 statistics published as required in section 312-3 and i don't like that because i like the way

338
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,640
 Glasgow did it and in general i think the business meeting should hue to the way world cons are

339
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,120
 choosing to solve problems rather than trying to solve them in a different way and force the

340
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,520
 world con to change i think there should be a thing saying you have to publish any moves or

341
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,320
 disqualifications and you have to explain why you did it i i would just like it to have a little

342
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,000
 bit more flexibility as to when the world con actually announces that and i think there's probably

343
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,640
 that that that might be able to be ironed out in the meeting when they discuss this hard degree on

344
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:08,080
 this what what Glasgow has done in terms of hugo transparency is it seems to be just about perfect

345
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,280
 to me and and should be a model for future world cons yeah i think you could say must be published

346
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,920
 like at the latest with the statistics but you can choose to publish earlier and that would be a

347
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:25,120
 small change to the wording and would be fine agreed f6 i don't like because it makes up a new body it

348
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,520
 doesn't actually say what the body is it replaces the mark protection committee but it doesn't seem

349
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:37,360
 to replace the duties of the mark protection committee or basically it's just a mess it's a

350
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,320
 badly badly written mess this is one of the reasons why i think we need a committee uh i

351
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,840
 would vote against just i think it's i i respect what it's trying to do i just think it does what

352
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,080
 it's trying to do extremely badly would our marks be unprotected if this best look right mark plumber

353
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,720
 is a guest of honor and is this how we repay him by ceasing his protection for shame listeners

354
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,760
 for shame any other thoughts on f6 other than boo it's very long oh it's it's just

355
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:16,240
 i mean it's just terrible i i mean one of the things that worries because because of having done

356
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,720
 a job that involved a lot of government drafting not not legal drafting but but you know writing

357
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,680
 things that are clearer say what you mean them to say i don't think it's a skill we're that great

358
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:34,000
 at in fandom and i don't know how we get the people who are good at it onto the committees that they

359
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,600
 need to be on to make this stuff good but this is not good there are two types of people in the world

360
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,840
 there are people who do not mind appearing less intelligent than they are because they explain

361
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,800
 things in a way that is understandable and there are people who are very keen that you understand

362
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,960
 exactly how clever they are and they word things in ways which are incomprehensible to reinforce

363
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:59,760
 their status and fandom is very full of the latter in ways that make it difficult because

364
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,920
 a lot of these discussions revolve around people showing how big they're basically showing how big

365
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:14,000
 them business meeting penises surely you mean business meeting brain john no no i definitely

366
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,040
 think i mean penis i think i think the problem is that it turns out the mark protection committee

367
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,400
 is like you basically have to go through and find everywhere you mentioned the mark protection

368
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:29,440
 committee and replace it and so some of it is just minor changes there but it's quite complicated

369
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,280
 and then you have to do things like okay well if the wall con committee has these powers which

370
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,800
 we're now going to delegate to wussf which epigems will science fiction awards or something

371
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,640
 then it just gets complicated but yeah i worry that this is not the way to set up a committee

372
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,760
 which they also say potentially has paid staff they say they will be supported by mark licensing

373
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,000
 fees paid by will con and they give like percentage of membership fees i went and figured out and for

374
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,080
 Glasgow i think it means they would have got a budget of about 18 000 pounds i'm not sure if

375
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,320
 that's actually enough to do anything with paid staff by the other hand it would be a lot of money

376
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,520
 to not use in a sensible way if it turns out we haven't set this committee up correctly

377
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,640
 so i think this really does need a lot of intensive study i've just had a comment thought on that

378
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,600
 18 000 pounds which is that it's it's not it's not merely not enough it's not enough by at least one

379
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,720
 and possibly two orders of magnitude i don't think they have any idea how much it would cost to retain

380
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,920
 professionals in this area well it doesn't specify what you'd have the professionals doing it might

381
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,400
 be enough to get like you know like the legal advice on the trademarks or whatever it's not

382
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,720
 enough for natural paid staff but it might do a round of auditing on a very simple thing or

383
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,920
 something like that or just like someone professional looking at the accounts that should be within it

384
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,680
 but i mean that's supposedly five percent of every wussfers membership so i think if you

385
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,240
 upped it much people would start to get a bit like really f9 disqualifies Hugo administrators

386
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:12,400
 who are romans in favor i'm in favor but i also just keep thinking okay so what if

387
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,360
 hypothetically we had another world con in two years time which decided to appoint

388
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:26,800
 Dave McCarty as Hugo administrator at this point we then basically get to okay so you've declared

389
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,440
 just that that declares themselves to be an incompetent world con but they know that's going

390
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,840
 to happen so kind of what what are the sanctions basically and i think it's very tricky like what

391
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:41,840
 would happen if another con did decide to go rogue what could we realistically do about that

392
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,960
 and i think the problem is we don't really have sanctions for that because it's not something

393
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,440
 we generally thought would occur i don't like this partly because of the lack of sanctions and

394
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,200
 partly because you just redefine the role so that he was in a slightly different role but nevertheless

395
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:02,320
 had the power and also i worry about banning people from working on world cons when it's

396
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,800
 you know getting good people to work on world cons is a problem even though obviously i don't

397
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,360
 personally think Dave McCarty should be Hugo administrator again i think having a process that

398
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:19,520
 doesn't exclude the bad actors will make it harder to get good people to work on world cons and not

399
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:28,080
 easier i understand the sentiments but i think if you have a organization which is riddled with

400
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,200
 corruption it is hard to get people interested in working for that organization who do not want

401
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,080
 to be associated with corruption and so i think the answer to that is making sure you don't have

402
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,920
 the corruption i think this acts in the direction of more good people i do agree with Liz there's no

403
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,400
 way of sanctioning realistically there's no teeth to the constitution but that's true anyway so i

404
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:57,520
 don't know i don't know i think you ought to wear with what you can i will also say i think that

405
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,720
 the idea of the world's constitution is to set up what we want the world come to look like and i

406
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,480
 think even if a committee did basically say well you can be the Hugo administrator but Dave's going

407
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,000
 to tell you what to do on the secret and if you tell anyone we'll shout your kneecaps like i think

408
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,600
 that's impossible to avoid but i think making it clear that we don't want that to be how it is

409
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,080
 is valuable because it sends a message i think we've probably recapitulated the business

410
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,480
 mutual discussion at least in part on that topic and i think i will be interested to see where this

411
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,880
 one ends up this is one of the amendments that i thought was quite interesting but it might just

412
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,200
 get dumped into a committee with the rest of the committee things so i've got thoughts against it but

413
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,880
 if it passes i won't be upset i just think it probably won't do a lot but maybe it's fine to have

414
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,560
 that symbol in the constitution anyway and then f11 f11 yes which is the last one

415
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,320
 oh we sort of set up an extra committee more committees yeah we set up a sort of monitoring

416
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:59,120
 committee of people independent from the next two world cons who form a committee and report back

417
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,920
 on anything they observed in Hugo and site selection voting or presumably if they are not allowed to

418
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,560
 see any of the figures then their report back that this will come didn't let's see anything

419
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,360
 i think i'm kind of in favor of this although it seems like a lot of committees still but i think

420
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:26,160
 having like imagined that 2026 and 2027 have a an observation committee formed of three previous

421
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,880
 Hugo administrators or something because if we're letting these people then probably presumably

422
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,360
 the people who have been good Hugo administrators will be first in line yeah it could be quite good

423
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,760
 i was just thinking about probably Hugo administrators and considering the fact that that might end up

424
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,880
 with ferrets in a sack but it's possible that that one of the ferrets wouldn't be invited to be one

425
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,920
 of the three people yeah i suspect that if the business meeting is voting on who gets to be on

426
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,400
 this subcommittee you know we won't like vote for our own destruction probably i just have this

427
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,480
 image when liz was like Hugo administrators and it could be good i just had this image of liz like

428
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,280
 patting Hugo administrators on my head going who's a good Hugo administrator who's a good Hugo administrator

429
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:15,920
 oh yeah now i have a new art prompt because yeah so we broadly speaking in favor of f/11

430
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,640
 i think so unless by passing this we make the job of whatever committee that comes up in d9

431
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,160
 more complicated i i think this should be limited to the committee that's the the committee of the d9

432
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,640
 as one of the things that they're looking at i will say i think it's evidence in favor of having

433
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,720
 committees to look at this stuff the various motions that have been proposed by the mark

434
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,240
 protection committee are fairly sane and well considered and i would hope that that would

435
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,120
 extend to other committees as well i i think i'm sort of broadly in favor of f/11 but might want

436
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:59,280
 it to be committee motions d11 to d14 concern the shenanigans at chengdu more directly um two of them

437
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,480
 are um redacted from the agenda i'll come on to that in a second one is an apology

438
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:15,760
 um which we will discuss the meaning of that and then one basically explicitly means that the

439
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:24,880
 works removed will be designated finalists despite not appearing on the ballot the reason the two that

440
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,200
 are redacted are redacted is because scottish defamation law effectively means that if you can show

441
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,200
 damage to reputation then you are guilty of defamation unless you can prove the same as you made it true

442
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,480
 and Glasgow have sought legal advice and decided that they would be best not to publish this text

443
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,080
 themselves text is available online um one of them's on par 770 and the other i think is in the

444
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,360
 business meeting discord i will endeavor to put links to both of them in the show notes and it will be

445
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,880
 discussed at the meeting but it won't be kind of officially published by the worldcom there's been

446
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,520
 quite a lot of hand-wringing over this from some people i basically think it's a very unfortunate

447
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,920
 situation that has been handled as transparently as humanly possible which stands in stark contrast

448
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,320
 to the actions of some previous people in which things were handled with much less transparency

449
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:26,800
 in ways that made me cross so that is my thoughts there Alison and Liz what are your thoughts

450
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,520
 i mean on the resolutions or on the you know on any of it on on the like you know not publishing

451
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,760
 the full content of these resolutions and discussing them like in a i think unfilmed and

452
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,400
 unstreamed bit of the business meeting yeah i mean it seems fair enough i'm not legal expert but i

453
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:57,360
 do remember that worldcom 76 spent an awful lot of money to resolve a defamation case and i suspects

454
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,840
 all the other world cons have looked at that and gone boy we really do not want to be in that

455
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:07,440
 situation where we spent several years and tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on this and

456
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,040
 have taken legal advice and gone for the absolute safe route and i can't really blame for it i

457
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,560
 agree with that i am sad to see that this part of the business meeting will not be streamed because

458
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:25,280
 as as you know bob i'm very much into the business meeting in general becoming as online as it

459
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,800
 possibly can and the free streaming of business meetings well i can't actually attend the world

460
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,360
 con is one of the things i particularly like about modern world cons because i generally attend all

461
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,400
 of the business meeting in the years i'm not at the world but this worldcom made the decision to

462
00:44:40,400 --> 00:45:02,800
 not require wis

463
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,280
 but i am in favor of passing a resolution one of these resolutions to basically say

464
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,800
 look what happened last year is not something the business meeting grieves of and approves of

465
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,520
 and we apologize to those people who are affected i think i'd also be okay with adding those people

466
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,640
 to the official finalist list as a you know a gesture which cannot make up for being excluded

467
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,640
 from the actual finalist list but i go back and forth on that one i think it's a shame we've got

468
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,840
 like four resolutions and not maybe one resolution but that's just how things have gone this year we

469
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,520
 have a lot of kind of competing and slightly overlapping resolutions and amendments i mean

470
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:46,560
 yes that's not uncommon for wis just business meeting agendas and and the way that the the way

471
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,760
 that the organization works almost compels that if you've got different views or things you're

472
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,120
 going to get competing amendments i would like to see a motion of censure past in sub form i want

473
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,760
 to say that clearly me too if you had to pick one of these which one would it be

474
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,960
 i mean i don't have 11 and 12 to hand because they're not in the agenda i'd have to go and get

475
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:17,760
 them back off of file 17 17 but i am perfectly happy with d 13 which i think kind of overlaps

476
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:26,560
 quite a bit with d 14 despite having the same proposal in one case well i think d 14 is designed

477
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:33,360
 to d 14 is designed to make sure that those things are listed as finalists even if d 13 does not pass

478
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:40,720
 i suspect the intention is to let people go along with the finalists bit even if they don't

479
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,200
 want the apology bit but i think i want the apology bit so like yeah i think i'd just split

480
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,040
 them have an apology and then have the finalist bit rather than having a both and then a half of

481
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,640
 it but anyway happy to pass both of those i don't like the wording of d 13 which i think is

482
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:01,760
 a flowery in that kind of roberts fools parliamentarian way that winds me up quite often

483
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,880
 so but i would like a simpler apology apologies are best the short when they're nice and short

484
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:14,720
 whereas i agree with allison and whereas i think that was a good point

485
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:23,120
 um be it resolved that octa thought considers d 13 to be good but bit flowery yes um all those in

486
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,720
 favor say aye aye aye no i'm trying to push this to a serpentine vote here

487
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:40,400
 what serpentine vote great on radio one two three hey there we go okay it was unanimous listeners

488
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,000
 who wants to introduce wispous memberships and stuff so there's f1 and f2 the first one is

489
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,640
 about what you do if people accidentally purchase duplicate wispous memberships and the second one

490
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,880
 is basically saying instead of saying wispous membership and attending supplement we go back

491
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,040
 to supporting membership and attending membership and i'm not super i'm not super concerned by either

492
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,720
 although i do like how f2 just says you know if we pass this go and change it back to the old

493
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,960
 terminology throughout the constitution rather than listing every single place in the constitution

494
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,120
 where we have to change it yeah i mean i don't think this actually changes the new thing where

495
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,080
 you have the wispous membership and the attending supplement on top and you can't ever sell that

496
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:25,920
 wispous membership unless voting has not opened i mean i was in favor of them all being more

497
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,600
 transferable anyway but i understand it's apparently awkward to deal with i just feel sorry for all

498
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,760
 the people who bought wilcom memberships and are now selling them at glass you know selling

499
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,520
 their Glasgow memberships at the last minute and can't sell the wispous bit i don't know i think both

500
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,520
 of these are probably like things that we should talk about but maybe not this year so i oppose

501
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:52,480
 considering them but if they get considered i'd probably in favor of f2 in Nicholas White's

502
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,360
 early commentary on the agenda which we're linking to he says about some other items

503
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:02,880
 some of this stuff matters but it's not for this year this year needs to concentrate on

504
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,120
 cleaning up from last year and i absolutely agree with that and this is an example of something

505
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:13,600
 that can wait yeah i mean i'll say that Chengdu passed on an unusually high number of items to be

506
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,240
 ratified before we even start on the new business and new resolutions so it was going to be

507
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,360
 quite a lot anyway and i think we just have to postpone anything that's not completely vital in

508
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,160
 order that we at the business meeting actually gets everything done in time i say we i'm not

509
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,040
 going to go to the whole business meeting i might go to parts of it but i'm not spending 20 hours

510
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:39,200
 thinking about Robertsville de Vore. The mark protection committee have submitted f3 and f4

511
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:50,800
 so f3 provides explicit licensing of the wiswers marks and this comes up as a result of Kevin

512
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,840
 Sandley's comments last year about wiswers marks and how they run enforceable and some very uh

513
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,280
 enlightened people pointing out that that means that they can't be trademarks then because that's

514
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,640
 not how trademarks work and this is a attempt to bring the wiswers constitution in line with

515
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,000
 u.s trademark law and therefore i support it i think it probably is important enough to be in

516
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,560
 the mix this year and then the other one is they would quite like to be able to let mark protection

517
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,720
 member mark protection committee members force meetings of the mark protection committee and

518
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:28,160
 they would also like a mechanism for removing members of the mark protection committee and that's

519
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:34,720
 a direct result of the many shenanigans that had to go through for the mark protection committee to

520
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,320
 be able to do anything with the four people they sent showed earlier in the year and i think this

521
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:45,840
 is probably also something that we need to do so yeah broadly speaking in favor of f3 and 4

522
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,160
 how are you guys yeah it seems like we basically had a committee that sort of ticked along and

523
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,280
 norm was particularly concerned about it and then when it did become a big thing we realized that

524
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,600
 there were lots of handy mechanisms that should really be in place for any committee which were

525
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:06,240
 not and so this is an effort to tidy them up which is good and i do not know enough about the um

526
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,680
 i i mean i know a little about u.s trademark law but not enough to really comment here so i'm

527
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,440
 going to say if the mark protection committee think these changes are necessary then i think i'd

528
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:24,560
 agree with that so we have f10 which makes another committee and it is a committee basically

529
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:33,520
 that makes a Hugo oversight committee and a Hugo software advisory committee and so the first one

530
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:41,920
 is about more oversight of the Hugo's and the second one is about oversight of the Hugo's software

531
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:49,600
 i think the Hugo's software one is probably not necessary it just seems to add extra

532
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:56,400
 extra levels in and i'm not convinced we need them the Hugo oversight committee is basically another

533
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,080
 version of the Hugo committee we discussed earlier except instead of having members elected by the

534
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:08,080
 business meeting it will be elected by the association of science fiction and fancy artists the science

535
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:14,160
 fiction of fantasy rights association and the european s science fiction society which i mean

536
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,720
 have we taught them do they care like if you're going to say to software by the way you now

537
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,880
 appoint a member of the Hugo oversight committee meaning that your designated representative will be

538
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,800
 responsible for oversight of the Hugo's i don't know what they would think about that so we should

539
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,320
 probably check in with them on that i also worry that if we do this we i think we do need to make

540
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:43,280
 sure that for at world cons that take place in non-anglophone locations we are able to select

541
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,200
 enough people to be on those oversight committees who can really provide oversight yeah i mean it

542
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,920
 should at very least be two amendments and i think we've just got too many competing Hugo oversight

543
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:03,040
 amendments i will say i do definitely support having like sensible software to tabulate the Hugo's

544
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:09,120
 and it not just being as we discovered a big random SQL query that devant gati runs but i'm not

545
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,800
 sure having a software advisory committee is going to help because the number of people

546
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:19,360
 qualified to be on that is probably small and maybe they're already writing the Hugo software so

547
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,200
 kill this one pitch it back to the big committee see what the big committee say yep site selection

548
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:32,640
 changes so f12 basically acts to disenfranchise anyone who might want to join our community so

549
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,080
 you probably tell my opinion on that from the way i've described it

550
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:48,400
 and f13 f13 attempts to make sure that countries that hold the world con are countries that are a

551
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:55,200
 good fit for the world con and it does that through looking at the reporters without borders global

552
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:02,080
 score the freedom house freedom in the world data set and the economist intelligent units

553
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:10,000
 democracy index and like i see i see the point but i think this is exactly the sort thing that i

554
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,760
 would quite like to be discussed in committee rather than trying to hash out the details

555
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,920
 at the business meeting at the world con because i think this is one of those things where

556
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,640
 where you draw those lines probably needs quite a lot of discussion and i yeah i don't know i

557
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:32,240
 mean i feel like if i wouldn't want the world con going to a country whose um

558
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,480
 whose president was on record at saying they were playing to ban elections in the next four years

559
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:45,680
 so you know that's a start so i assume that i don't know how the democracy index is calculated

560
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:53,600
 but i assume that if if um the elections in the united states went away the united states would

561
00:54:53,600 --> 00:55:00,640
 go down in its democracy index score but yeah chris has done some quite good analysis on this

562
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,560
 actually and said look at what the countries that they don't like having covered i think we can't

563
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,800
 escape it in that we're you know if you look at these three i think they've chosen three different

564
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,880
 indexes you know because you only have to pass one of these indexes to be you know a place which

565
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:23,440
 is eligible to bid for a world con and what you can't escape is that on those three indexes it is

566
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,200
 the kind of the same countries which are coming up poorly in all of them and they are mostly not

567
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,760
 ones which have traditionally held world cons and they are mostly lower middle income countries

568
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,200
 you know especially in africa and parts of asian so i don't think you can really like we can't on

569
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:46,160
 you can't disentangle these things i think is the tricky one like it is just a fact that there are

570
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:51,120
 more kind of authoritarian regimes in those places but i don't know whether there are other

571
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:56,720
 indexes we could be looking at or if these three are really the best and that's exactly why i'd

572
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:02,640
 like to see this be in committee it also doesn't cover the issue where you've got a country that

573
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:11,200
 is a federation of states say where human rights varies and democracy varies quite a lot between

574
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,240
 the states and that could that could become an issue i mean just say america we know you know you

575
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,840
 mean the USA i don't think it necessarily just means america if if the EU ever managed to get to the

576
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:28,160
 state it wants to be then then or the united Arab Emirates yeah but i don't think any of the

577
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,960
 you know uae constituent states would pass right i think we've digressed anyway we had a bid

578
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,400
 we had a bid that was Saudi Arabia and like it did not win do we want to rely on

579
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:47,840
 bids in countries that are very bad for human rights just being defeated at the ballot box

580
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:55,040
 or do we want to have some rules i don't know whether 60 60 and 6 are the right levels and i

581
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,080
 don't know whether these are the right indices but i'm not inherently against the idea of trying

582
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:06,000
 to make sure that there is some safeguard but what i would say is that if you're only passing on one

583
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,200
 metric if things get reevaluated the next year it could be tricky so two things i want to say i

584
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,880
 think one of these is because after the change in will come a lot people came along and said you know

585
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,200
 why was china even allowed to bid for a world con and lots of people said well that's just how

586
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,200
 it works anyone can bid for will come and this is a way of saying no look we have minimum standards

587
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:35,920
 you cannot bid for will cons in places that don't meet these standards to kind of you know pass off

588
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,440
 that argument and the second thing is that the timing is very unfortunate because if this gets

589
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,040
 ratified so if this gets this gets passed this year and then ratified next year it would take

590
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:54,000
 effect in 2026 which is exactly the year in which the first place to be disqualified under these

591
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,840
 scores would be bidding because it's the year that Uganda would be bidding for 2028 so basically the

592
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,480
 first effect of it would be to disqualify bid in its first year that it was there and it also means

593
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:13,040
 that the Uganda bid are going to be basically waiting for a year to see if 2025 ratifies this

594
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,240
 to know if they'll even be allowed to continue the bid so i don't think there's a way around that but

595
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,560
 it's just going to be really unfortunate for them they will have to basically wait a year to decide

596
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:28,320
 if they can continue bidding or maybe they'll just drop out early because of the uncertainty but yeah

597
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,640
 i think like the first i think this coming into effect and the first thing it does is saying to

598
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:41,520
 the first african will come bid um bye bye is a really unfortunate side side effect and then there's

599
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:49,360
 when we censure you we mean it which basically means you can't put censured people on

600
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:57,520
 bids or let them administer world cons or you can't write in for them on site selection ballots

601
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,880
 etc but basically trying to take people that have been censured by the business meeting out of

602
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,440
 world con running which i think we've already discussed but um but yeah and then there's

603
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,480
 ratification and then we're done yes so Chengdu passed a bunch of stuff which has gone for

604
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:18,000
 ratification i have a suspicion that if the Chengdu business meeting had been bigger possibly fewer

605
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,960
 things would have been passed on for ratification if for example online voting had been an option

606
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,120
 so that people could come in and bus us members from around the world can participate remotely

607
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:36,960
 e5 seems pretty unobjectionable it basically means if you are bidding for site selection you have to

608
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:43,040
 have a postal address and an email address because these were passed last year there's no kind of

609
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:48,480
 little explanation for why they should be on the ballot seems fair enough you have to have a

610
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,680
 postal address is this so people can send you letters of complaint i don't know seems good let's

611
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:59,920
 rify it e6 is the one where when you file your site selection ballot you have to include your

612
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:06,160
 postal address email address and you may include a phone number and if you don't have your name your

613
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,760
 signature or your postal address then your ballot is only counters no preference and this i think is

614
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,560
 a reaction to all those Chengdu ballots that didn't have a postal address on by basically clarifying

615
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:24,960
 the word address in the constitution to be postal and email when presumably it was when it was written

616
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,600
 as just a dress didn't mean email address i don't think you really need someone's postal address to

617
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,800
 know they're a person who exists and i don't know what you're going to do with postal addresses

618
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:43,040
 anyway because what if i just write like john's house on my thing are you going to cross check it

619
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,080
 with what i put in my membership form what if i moved house it just seems like an extra requirement

620
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:53,520
 that we won't actually do anything with and is designed to close what people perceived of as a

621
01:00:53,520 --> 01:01:02,000
 loophole which probably wasn't loophole yes both both signature and postal address are very western

622
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,720
 constructs so i mean i don't mind this probably is something that needs to go off to the big hugre

623
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,760
 committee i don't mind having some requirement that means it is reasonably straightforward to

624
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,560
 acetate that this is an individual you were being i don't know what that would be but it's not this

625
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:21,760
 yeah you can't even say like a unique email address because people share email addresses within

626
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:28,480
 families and so on i think i agree with allison like i i don't inherently oppose there being

627
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,760
 more checks on whether people are natural persons especially given the news this year that there

628
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:39,120
 wasn't attempted to stuff the ballot by non natural persons but i don't know whether this is it and

629
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:45,040
 i would quite like it to be something that was thought through in a way that i felt better about

630
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:52,320
 so then i think the next one that's interesting is the fancast not paying compensation so this would

631
01:01:52,320 --> 01:02:00,720
 mean that if a fancast paid its contributors or staff monetarily it would not qualify as a fancast

632
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:07,840
 and i don't know what that means what is being paid is a patreon being paid yeah i don't think

633
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:14,240
 this is probably being thought through do we do we know i think a patreon is being

634
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:21,280
 paid i think i would argue it is but i'm worried that you could argue it isn't and i'm worried that

635
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,960
 what i'm going to argue that it definitely isn't until the amount you get from the patreon exceeds

636
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:33,120
 the costs of running the podcast that's the thing isn't it like if you take in an amount of money that

637
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:39,440
 means you can't pay your contributors or staff is that does that mean that this doesn't qualify

638
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,760
 and i don't know if that's clear from this i think that would be something that individual

639
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,320
 administrators would have to rule on and so i think this makes it fuzzier not less fuzzy so i think

640
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:56,640
 i'm against but i'm not sure i mean this has come from fanzine right like the wording in fanzine is

641
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:01,760
 that you can't pay your contributors and stuff other than in copies of the magazine so i think it's

642
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,880
 kind of lifted that language and i don't know of any fanzines that have patreons so i don't know if

643
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:14,480
 that's a problem i mean i can see they're trying to do stuff like okay if we say we had a patreon

644
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,480
 which got us enough money to pay an editor to professionally edit the podcast i can see that

645
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:27,840
 would be like a disqualifying thing but if we got a patreon that just paid like we got £20 a month

646
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,160
 that covered our hosting costs that seems like it shouldn't fundamentally disqualify us from

647
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:38,880
 being a fan cast yeah i think i agree with that i think i would agree with a resolution that said

648
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:46,800
 that my worry is that that is not this no but i think it's a case of there are some very clear

649
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,520
 lines but then there's going to be cases which are much closer to the edge like maybe you have a

650
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:57,360
 patreon that brings in £1,000 a year so that's more than you need for hosting or you know come to

651
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:02,960
 be more than you need for say hosting and podcast expenses does that count but not like

652
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,680
 money that you are living off should that count i would like to see a solution here that is

653
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:14,880
 consistent across fan artist fan writer fanzine and fan cast thank you maybe we need a committee

654
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:21,760
 for that as well e10 language requirement would change it so that at the moment if a work appeared

655
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:27,760
 in a language that wasn't english then it's also eligible in the year in which it first was published

656
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,720
 in english and if it work was published outside the united states it is eligible in the year in

657
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:37,440
 which it is published in the united states and it changes that so that it's the languages of the

658
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:43,600
 administering and prior world cons and it is the countries of the administering and prior world con

659
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:50,080
 and this sounds very good but i wish it was as well as the united states and as well as english

660
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:56,560
 because this year the world con is in scotland and last year it was in china and what this resolution

661
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:04,400
 would do is mean that anything which hasn't yet had a uk release date but was published in the us

662
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,680
 this year if this had taken effect that would not be eligible this year and then because there

663
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,240
 won't be another british world con for ten years it would also mean it wasn't eligible next year

664
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:19,360
 when it goes to seattle because it would already have been published in the us and so it would have

665
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:24,160
 fallen out of the eligibility window in one direction for the uk and fallen out in the other

666
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:29,040
 direction for the us and it would just never be eligible and i think that is a problem because i

667
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:35,040
 think this is very well intentioned because it reduces the implicit assumption that most world

668
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:41,840
 cons are held in the us but it does not address the problem which is most world cons are held in

669
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:49,280
 the us which is still true even if you ignore it really hard and most welcome members come

670
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:55,120
 from the world us even when the world con is not in the us and most dr thought listeners come from

671
01:05:55,120 --> 01:06:01,760
 the us really oh my god we know this we went we went through it on a previous episode in the

672
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,040
 after show yeah i just think this will mean that interesting works that are not from the us have

673
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:12,000
 a harder chance of being recognized and i think that will have the exact opposite effect to the

674
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,920
 thing it is trying to do and i worry i'm meant to sit down and do like a grid of okay what if we have

675
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:23,440
 world cons in say China followed by the uk followed by the us and all the different

676
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,520
 publications and when they would be eligible but i didn't do it because it would be a very

677
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:32,720
 boring spreadsheet but i am worried about edge cases that i haven't considered while being

678
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:38,560
 thinking this is generally a good thing yeah so i think i might be against ratification until

679
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,040
 someone can demonstrate to me that it doesn't end up disenfranchising things that would otherwise

680
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:48,080
 have a chance effectively i would be entirely in favor of this amendment if it didn't have any

681
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:53,600
 strike throughs and just had the word and a few more times yeah but this is now for ratification

682
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,480
 so it can't be changed yeah that's the problem isn't it if only i had been able to participate

683
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:04,320
 in last year's business meeting uh right and then it's as thick Liz you're our asian correspondent

684
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:10,880
 yeah yes so this is the idea that we should have an asian science fiction convention i just haven't

685
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:18,960
 quite i don't quite understand where like the pushes for this unless there are basically i would

686
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,800
 want to see fandoms from a whole bunch of asian countries who really wanted this and even then

687
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:29,280
 i'm not sure it makes sense to have it under the world con umbrella but i also think we should

688
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:36,080
 abolish the nazvik anyway so i think i'm not in favor of this i am in favor of more conventions

689
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:42,160
 and potentially will come supporting things like an asian science fiction convention either through

690
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:48,480
 people assisting or by financial support and seed funding and so on but i don't think i'm in

691
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,760
 favor of adding an extra thing that the will come is for some reason administrating in basically

692
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:00,800
 every year because asian wilcons are pretty few and far between lizz is completely right i just

693
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,280
 don't want a bunch of white people to go to asia and start running conventions there thinking

694
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,120
 they're helping oh do you think this is what this was about i think this is about having a one i

695
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:15,840
 think it's about pushing back against the fact that the constitution for some reason has the nazvik

696
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,720
 and no equivalent in other places which is a historical anomaly we should correct and i think

697
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:27,760
 this is about correcting it and also possibly about having a like wisface affiliated convention

698
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:34,560
 in china more often if you had asphyx every couple of years and then a kz would bid for a world con

699
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,480
 based on that that could be a success

700
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:48,240
 picks next time we're going to do picks so we're going to do very quick picks or not do pick i think

701
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:52,560
 we can not do picks to be honest it's going to be so long i think we can just say look come and see

702
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:59,040
 us in clasco and in then we've got some picks you can do live in person picks by asking me and john

703
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:04,720
 and allison in the bar what we like and what we've been reading and doing recently or at the table

704
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:10,160
 talk or a table talk please sign up for a table talk or we'll feel silly also all of them are just

705
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:15,040
 going to pick a generic thing anyway which was not science fiction related so there's no evidence

706
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,600
 that the lake district isn't a spaceship that's been buried in the north of england-liss

707
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:25,760
 yep first time for everything ah that was the old thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's

708
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:41,680
 goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me

709
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:56,800
 oh there's a big bee in my room no it's a wasp a giant wasp um we might need to pause for a minute

710
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:04,320
 while i uh watch the wasp carefully liz liz looks quite worried about this it's really big

711
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,800
 you've got a webcam liz show us the wasp show us the wasp show us the wasp

712
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,720

713
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:19,040
 ah the wasp is gone the wasp has gone back out the window we're good all right hey good wasp

714
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:28,720
