1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Close parenthesis.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:16,300
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:24,300
 119th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 26th of September

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,800
 2024. I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,300
 We have a I would argue a plethora of letters of comment this episode

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,560
 And we're gonna start with Alison not the Alison wrote in but Alison

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,860
 You know Neil Harrison wrote in and said I don't think Alison ever closes the

8
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,640
 Paranthetical that she opens when she mentions the Cambridge fantasy society

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,120
 She says open parenthesis and never says closed parenthesis

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,040
 So all of the rest of the episode is within an enclosed left parenthesis

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,840
 I would appreciate it if the next episode starts with Alison saying closed parenthesis

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,840
 And I believe I have provided an appropriate close parenthesis. Yep

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,800
 I kind of drop open loops in conversation and writing all of the time and

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,320
 Because I'm not a computer programmer. I don't worry too much about this or a copy editor. Sorry Claire

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,480
 Yes, I respect Neil's attention to detail

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,280
 Yeah, cuz I was like what parenthesis where when and I listened to the episode in theory twice

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,080
 So we're gonna group our letters of comment by theme this episode listeners

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,560
 So we've just had the parenthesis theme and now we're gonna talk about Hugo's

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,200
 More specifically our winning one and Liz will introduce that yes

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,240
 So we're still very excited about that, but we also got a lot of letters about that

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,040
 So I'm gonna start with a letter from Christopher J Garcia

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,120
 Who wrote his disjointed thoughts from the Trader Joe's parking lot? Thank you Chris

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,320
 And he says octa-thop wins

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,400
 Thank You Chris and that it sounds like an incredible convention

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,600
 He also says it's highly possible that Alison could win Hugo's for best fanzining Glasgow in LA and then best fancast in Glasgow in LA

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,240
 Which would be quite exciting. Hmm. Yeah, yes

27
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,780
 Sentence not sound at all enthused by this

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,000
 This prospect I wouldn't like that to be a reason why anyone nominated us. I think that's my point

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,200
 I don't think I don't think if we end up on the LA ballot

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,720
 Which we may or may not and it would be an honor if we were I don't think that would be the primary reason

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
 I'm not worried

32
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,120
 I've seen a lot of Hugo ballot or a lot of Hugo

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,680
 Long lists and I believe that people nominate things for Hugo's for all sorts of daft reasons

34
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,560
 And this would not surprise me the slutter on the subject of winning a Hugo and the open shore wrote to us on

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:57,440
 Mastodon and said regarding Liz and the photograph his recollection is that Liz insisted that he hold the Hugo award

36
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,720
 Despite him saying that it really should be her holding it. So yes, it's lovely photo

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,600
 But the optics are misleading so Liz you've been called out

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,080
 And then he goes on to say on the subject of the award themselves

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,600
 I saw John for the first time since Worldcon last week at the Newcastle first Thursday listeners and asked him

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,400
 How long did it take you to stop touching it every day in what I now recognize as typical Cox and humor?

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,600
 He replied I think it's getting on 22 years now Andy. I did say that. Gosh you are young aren't you?

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,120
 I am young. Yes, and also he agrees with Liz about the parties

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,800
 I think I think Alison also thought this which was that the party atmosphere was not

44
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,760
 Good due to the size of the venue, but that is not Hugo related

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,040
 But thank you very much for hanging Andy. I can't remember all if I made Andy hold the Hugo

46
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,160
 It's possible I had begun to become bored of carrying it around with me

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,800
 I can mention was like no you hold it for bit, you know like it to baby or something

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,840
 They're heavy also like babies. They're probably not quite actually I don't know if they're heavier than babies

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,480
 listeners right in does anyone have a baby and a Hugo so we had a letter from Peri-Ann Laurie

50
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,080
 She also said congratulations, and we're not gonna say everyone said congratulations

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,760
 So we probably shouldn't mention it every time I couldn't congratulate you in person because I was at the bus was

52
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,040
 Business meeting during the live podcast. I'm so sorry Peri-Ann

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,520
 I have been going to parent business meeting for over 30 years initially it was entertaining

54
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,680
 but now I fear I'm just a masochist and

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,840
 She says we can't have people

56
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,720
 Spending 20 hours in the business meeting during the world gone and if we have members who attend virtually

57
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,480
 But have no say in the governance

58
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,960
 How can we call them members and it is clear to me that we now have an 18th century governance system for a 21st century?

59
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,000
 Organization some of us have been batting around ideas on the disc on a discourse server

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,720
 Is this the same as the existing bus for this school server?

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,480
 Is this a different one many of which have been referred to a new committee co-chaired by far and Colin?

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,880
 So perhaps we'll have some solutions for next year's meeting to discuss

63
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,560
 Yes, so is this the same discord server or different different school server? I get confused. I don't know

64
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,800
 We hope hopefully

65
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,800
 Peri-Ann will write in and tell us I assume is the same one, but I'm not sure I went to a whole 45 minutes of business meeting

66
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,240
 But due to technical hitches, there was no actual business going on. So I just tried to jump. Yes, that did happen

67
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,960
 What what particularly were you going to see?

68
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,280
 Oh, just you know see if it was interesting

69
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,000
 Well, I had the hope they might get to something I was interested in in the first like hour

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,840
 But as it is we didn't get anywhere. So I in fact it was a full-on hope

71
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,800
 We wouldn't have gotten you on to any business in the first hour anyway. It was in my hotel. I drank coffee

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
 Yes, exactly right. It was like round the corner from breakfast

73
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,940
 So it wasn't hard to drop in on the way to the convention. Okay. Do you want to do Renee Liz?

74
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,560
 So we Renee wrote as an email about recusal and we said

75
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:57,120
 Police send us your your loud opinions on that and she did send us our loud opinions and I'm gonna paraphrase him as best I can

76
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,700
 But really opinion is there is a place for considered permanent recusal from an award or category for professionals

77
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,320
 But they're not sold on it for fan categories for fans who have not professionals

78
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,440
 Essentially because it's reviewing and critiquing work in s of fandom that isn't being done elsewhere and being done from a fan only

79
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,280
 Perspective and to a permanent recusal kind of remove your voice from that conversation and she worries that if more and more

80
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:29,280
 Non-professionals permanently recuse themselves then we end up in a place where like these voices are absent from the category rather than being a space

81
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,600
 Where old and new voices can mingle? Yeah, I think that is a pretty interesting opinion

82
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,960
 Actually that there's kind of a difference between professionals who are often getting recognition in lots of places and fans

83
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,560
 And this may be the place where non-professionals in the fan categories. This is one of the few places they get visibility

84
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,400
 I mean, I do like that nerds of a feather kind of previously one recuse themselves

85
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
 And other people won for a few years and then nerds of a feather came back and went again

86
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,680
 I thought quite like that so I think that's maybe the model I would be aiming for take a year off

87
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,040
 Don't get that kind of bounce of name recognition in the next year or the next couple years

88
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,680
 But then when you feel like it you can put yourself back into the back into the ring if you want to we didn't say last time

89
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,960
 But it does sound from what John was saying about it would be an honor to be on the ballot in

90
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:21,560
 Los Angeles that we are planning to recuse for a year rather than longer. Don't know who quite decided I did say if I

91
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,240
 Think that is reasonable. I think this leads

92
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,680
 nicely on to a letter from Meg MacDonald who says long-time this in the first time writer and then notes texts to John

93
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,120
 Don't count which you know is gutting to hear Meg

94
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,840
 writes very

95
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,920
 eloquently

96
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,560
 This is tricky right because it's bad form to write read out good reviews on the podcast. So hmm

97
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,000
 She says she thinks some of the work we've done so far in 2024 in discussing incredibly fraught issues

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,960
 And the passion nuance and kindness and integrity with which we have dealt with them deserve to be recognized on the ballot and heard by far more people

99
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,680
 She then goes on to say I feel like you've I did not eat that from a collective conversation

100
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,640
 When it all rolls back for next year and that feels like a shame in a waste

101
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,320
 so I think that kind of echoes the sentiment that

102
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,640
 It's all about a conversation and taking those voices away can be a negative as well as a positive

103
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,400
 She then wrapped up with ps Liz needs far more airtime

104
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,280
 Which yes fair enough we we are aware. Sorry Liz. I want to pick up a little on this

105
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,240
 I think one of the things we want to do is

106
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,960
 surface a lot of the other good podcasts over the next year that are doing things if not exactly like us because

107
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,680
 Obviously, there's nothing that's exactly like us but are actually in this vanished space and

108
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:46,040
 Contributing things to the community and I think this is something that that I feel pretty strongly about that one of the great advantages of producing

109
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,600
 Is so that you can highlight other people who are doing really good work?

110
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,320
 We're still in the conversation Meg

111
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,360
 You can still listen to us even if we're not the Hugo nominated podcast doctor thought next year

112
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,280
 And I mean that's it I would hope that the visibility that we get we're getting that visibility anyway from having one Hugo win

113
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,320
 And I'm not sure a second would add a huge amount because everyone knows that the Hugo win is life-changing

114
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,280
 I mean if anyone comes and breaks into a house. We've got something to bludgeon them to death with now

115
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,920
 No, that's a bit over the top. I mean we can't keep that in. Oh, that's going in Liz. There's no doubt in my mind

116
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,600
 That's that that not only is it going in is the episode title. It's a bit violent. Go on

117
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,760
 There are three of us at this house. We have three bludgeoning tools

118
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,440
 It does occur to me that therefore you do need to want to count how you got two hands dual wheeled hugoes

119
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,120
 But what only one of them is my bludgeoning hand

120
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:47,120
 So if you've ever bludgeoned any one with your offhand please write it open brackets not you Chris

121
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,920
 I am very torn because this is gonna be like exhibit a

122
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,440
 If my like forthcoming trial

123
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,400
 So full disclosure when we won I was like we should just recuse forever and like we've got you I've got a Hugo

124
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,320
 Frog to Thorpe it'll always be my Hugo Frog to Thorpe

125
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:08,840
 very honored and I've been I feel very valued and recognized and and all of those things and I'm like do I

126
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:15,440
 Need to be someone who has all of these feelings again. I thought that bubbles to the surface after

127
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,720
 Reading Megs letter is that I had not quite thought about the reverse and and this is an

128
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,640
 Sentiment there was echoed in the Facebook comments, which was people like seeing us when they you go

129
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,640
 and I hadn't really figured any of that part of the

130
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,920
 Process into my thinking on the matter

131
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,640
 And I think I need to think about that some more and so I I would I thank Meg for hanging because it made me think quite hard about

132
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,960
 my own

133
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,880
 Motivations for like what I wanted from everything and that was really useful. So yeah, thank you Meg

134
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,160
 And then we have put links so we have put links in the show notes to the Facebook comments on the episodes where people

135
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,800
 congratulated us on winning Hugo. I will put everyone who congratulated us. I will try and put their name in the show notes

136
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:10,120
 Apologies and advance for the people I miss out who I will definitely miss out. So Sandra Bond wrote us a little poem

137
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,600
 I shall recite there's a wulk on the held up in Glasgow where the you go isn't such things are done

138
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,520
 And I listen Scott and Liz Batty and John Chox and we're chuffed because they won. Thank you Sandra

139
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,120
 Hey

140
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,200
 It was very lovely. That's very sweet. Thank you. Thank you, Sandra

141
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,240
 Oct thought poetry corner. Oh, yes at that poem is at least three lines

142
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,520
 So I want to put out such as his Hugo eligible in 2025 for shadowing alright

143
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,080
 So that's enough about he goes for a while

144
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,360
 We'll probably remind you about he'll go in again and again until you're totally fed up

145
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,280
 We also got lots of other things in the last episode or the one before we talked about

146
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,680
 Worldcon

147
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
 Information

148
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,760
 Basically, we talked about the info desk about the lack of maps about not having a paper newsletter and so on

149
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,720
 And it turns out people have strong opinions on these and they rolled into us

150
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,920
 We did get a letter from Alan Fleming who was the area head for the info team at the Glasgow will come

151
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
 So thank you Alan for writing in and be very nice

152
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,880
 He says another member of staff said to me that every contest turns into an info desk

153
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
 And I think that is actually true

154
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,480
 Basically, if you have some people who look like they might know something or are semi-official

155
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,720
 Then yeah, you basically turn into an info desk whether you like it or not

156
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,560
 So that's probably true

157
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,360
 But yeah, possibly we need like a big sort of a great big red arrow saying info here or something

158
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,200
 And he did say that they needed more signage

159
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,760
 But the cost of hanging banners in a conference center is high

160
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,200
 Yes

161
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,160
 He basically limited to like little mini mini signs or things on stands or whatever

162
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,920
 I wonder if we could have taken the big display board near the escalators and turned that into giant arrow and put an info desk

163
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,320
 Like right there. I want to pick coming on info desk location because as people may remember

164
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,920
 I ran info desk at intersection in

165
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,320
 1995 done, and I don't remember that so

166
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
 That's why I said it

167
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,360
 One of the things about Alan's thoughts on info desk is that they are not at all dissimilar from my thoughts having done it in 1995

168
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,400
 But we did stick it in the concourse roughly

169
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:19,800
 Where the registration desk was this year with a big sign on it saying info desk as a result

170
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,240
 We took most of the information. We also set it up

171
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:30,160
 24 hours earlier than we were expected to set it up because it was obvious that all of the other convention spaces

172
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,680
 Were unable to do any jobs because they were overrun with people asking for simple information

173
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,520
 so on a related note about fans asking for help on anything and everything from anyone who have to be sitting behind a desk

174
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:51,640
 That's what Peter Sullivan says. He had the online equivalent of this in the online team had an email help list for online queries

175
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,840
 Which kind of had to be emailed because if you can't figure out how to get onto the discord or any other

176
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,640
 kind of world-con space then you probably need to be by email and

177
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,360
 They got a few people who clearly thought it was just a general convention help desk email

178
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,480
 And they had to pass them on to the right division

179
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,800
 He says I do remember one email asking where the courtesy bus from their hotel to the convention site was leaving from and

180
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,200
 Yeah, that's probably an email where you want to say yes

181
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,360
 I will pass you on to facilities for that one so that facilities can say hmm. What courtesy bus?

182
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,120
 Yep, the convention never said anything about courtesy bosses, right?

183
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,040
 I think there was like one little van that ran around the the SEC site

184
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,320
 But I think generally if the con haven't said anything about bosses

185
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,360
 There's no buses guys stop buses. I think that SEC had a bus

186
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,880
 But yeah, I'm not sure

187
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,360
 When I've done social media for a convention, I've discovered that the social media

188
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,080
 channels also get treated as a general help desk

189
00:14:52,080 --> 00:15:00,280
 Information channel and I found that about half of the queries I was getting were kind of instantly answerable with

190
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,840
 Lines that we already had and the other this is not Glasgow. This is different conventions and the other half were

191
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,080
 All of the form I need now to write a message to the person who job this is to say

192
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,760
 Please get your finger out and make some progress on this topic because we are getting queries about it

193
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:23,320
 And a lot of those ones were of the form I have written to X at ycom.com

194
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,360
 Six times and had no response and I understand you're all volunteers, but it's been however many weeks

195
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,120
 I've also been on the other end of that transaction. I shouldn't say I'm I'm kind of some paragon of con running or anything like that

196
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,480
 But I think anything that's got any sort of generalness about it is going to get a load of queries and then Doug talks about

197
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,480
 maps and

198
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,640
 He says many more physical maps posted but he were here would have been appropriate and

199
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,320
 The online program should have had hyped links for the description of where the item was with perhaps another link to a map

200
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,360
 Maybe even with the location marked we did talk about

201
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,880
 Andrew January's map project last episode

202
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,440
 But I think that is the sort of thing that Andrew would quite like to be able to do

203
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,560
 I'm terribly worried. I'm putting lots of words in Andrew's mouth

204
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,640
 So Andrew if you disagree with anything I've said here, please do write in and and set the record straight

205
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,920
 But I believe that is that is one of the goals

206
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,120
 He has wouldn't it be great if you clicked on the link and it popped up a little map on your phone with a little blob mark

207
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,600
 You were here using your GPS and then a little like thing that rooted you to the program room like a Disney

208
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,320
 Hi, Andrew GPS GPS not great in conference. I just put in principle. That's that's not impossible

209
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,760
 So they do do this at Disney and it is great. So like it is hard, but I have seen it done like

210
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,840
 Obviously Disney is mostly outdoors. So I don't know it's also chock full of

211
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,440
 Long-range receivers because they were gonna do more stuff with their magic band things

212
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,320
 So there's gonna be a lot more kind of stuff that happened when it detected you in locations

213
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,600
 But I think they basically didn't end implementing a lot

214
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,960
 But as part of that project they blanketed the whole thing in Wi-Fi and put in a lot of receivers

215
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,640
 So that might be helping them with that. I don't know it could do that actually

216
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,580
 I never use that functionality. I used it to get to Oga's cantina

217
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:18,100
 Liz on the first day and then I knew the way to Oga's cantina and I did not need the math anymore because I am

218
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,660
 predictable we also got some comments pertaining to

219
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,720
 our discussion of communications and that kind of thing last episode

220
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,360
 First one I'll read is from Duncan or Master Dom

221
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:40,280
 Who talked about the discord and he says he thinks engagement during program items was lower than Duncan is used to at Easter cons

222
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,040
 And he he didn't feel like it was quite the roundy back channel

223
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,400
 He has grown used to and that's interesting because the discord was very active

224
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,120
 But did you guys find that it was less active for program than you've become accustomed to I?

225
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,760
 Was surprised for my program items how little

226
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,580
 Interaction engagement there was on discord. There were a lot of people attending the convention

227
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:10,480
 Online and I was expecting that to be reflected in quite a lot of commentary on the items

228
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,400
 But but there was very little apart from one item where I think there was quite a lot of comment on

229
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,160
 Discord, but we may be a trained alistairist to do that now

230
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,040
 Yeah, no fair

231
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
 Liz you made a face

232
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,760
 Well, I was only on octa thought and up to the pad a lot of comments on discord

233
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,960
 So I don't know what it was like for anyone else's items

234
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,120
 Maybe people were just being present and in the moment

235
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,000
 I'm also going to guess that there was quite a high ratio of people there in person to people watching

236
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,160
 Online and of course that every room is screamed

237
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,000
 It would be interesting to know if rooms that were streamed did actually get more comments than rooms that were not streamed

238
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,080
 Oh, yeah

239
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,000
 I wonder if we have any listeners who could pull out that kind of data

240
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,120
 Oh, it is just pull out the number of the number of comments for each item and then I will do the other bit Andrew

241
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,480
 I mean, I mean whoever it might be I love that

242
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,440
 I have a large data project that I'm going to work with somebody who's not on the pod to do and

243
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,320
 They're definitely up for this. This sounds like the sort of thing that could progress in the new vancom.dev server

244
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,040
 So Chris Garcia says he doesn't like discord, but that's because he's a ramen lovely Chris

245
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,400
 But he also is yeah, we get a few of I've had a few comments like that from in various places from people who don't like discord

246
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,120
 It's how you're it's how you're configuring it guys

247
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,640
 Especially the people who like oh, I used to love you's letter the 80s, but I can't get the hang of discord

248
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,360
 It's so much better

249
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,640
 I think we should allow that there are people who don't like discord because not because they're not configuring it correctly

250
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:50,440
 But possibly because the way we are setting up our servers and so on leaves a conversation happening in a way that doesn't work for them

251
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,520
 I would say to Chris have you tried opening 17 different discord windows and reading them all at once because that might work for you

252
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,240
 on that topic

253
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,000
 Alison did try to listen to the podcast while simultaneously listening to the cricket

254
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,520
 But concluded that she is not Garcia enough to be able to pull it off and had to listen to one at a time like a normal person

255
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,920
 Can't edit it. I mean I did more or less managed to listen to the podcast while watching the cricket

256
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,120
 I'm getting better Chris. I may need training. Yeah, but quick. It's pretty slow

257
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,960
 There's not really a lot happening so you can probably listen to a big chunk of podcasts before anything happens

258
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,320
 Yeah, that's why cricket is great. Yeah, no

259
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,960
 I think I think it is tricky right because I'm sure there are I think there are probably people who would like discord if discord

260
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,200
 Less manic and I think there are things we can do to set up servers and that's one of the things I mentioned last

261
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,280
 Episode, but I think there are also probably people who just don't like discord

262
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,840
 So you know it's a broad church. No one's really a wrong man

263
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,080
 I love you all listeners except for you. You know who you are

264
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,240
 Chris also commented on paper

265
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,080
 He says paper is a good thing if you've got a period where there is boredom

266
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,000
 Which seems on the face of it to rule out Glasgow because it was many things but boring was not one of them

267
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,240
 He went to a conference where there were no newsletters in con areas, but in the cafe

268
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,960
 They had them on every table

269
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
 So that is interesting

270
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,440
 But then he goes on to say the funny thing is we've lost a huge amount of online data printed things are not as likely to go missing long term

271
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:19,400
 Paper is significantly more stable and I thought I was really interesting because Chris for those who don't know is a curator of

272
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:26,520
 Things and yeah, we hadn't really talked about the preservation aspect and the historical aspect very much

273
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,440
 And I thought it was a good point. Thank you Chris

274
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,380
 I mean this is this is one of the

275
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,960
 benefits of things in in kind of lumpy form like

276
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,480
 PDFs and podcasts that they do kind of sit around for for future archivists

277
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,840
 You know, I mean if we go offline

278
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,040
 I think the chances that one of our listeners has carefully downloaded every episode and stored them somewhere a very high

279
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,880
 Weird weird though. This is to imagine. I don't think I have a full copy of any

280
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:04,520
 Podcast I listen to listeners right in and also phalact.org if you if you want to if you want to plot an octave

281
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:11,640
 Did I say blocked right didn't mean blocked if you want an octave archive let us know I really rarely deleted stuff from my phone

282
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,180
 So I've probably got them all somewhere, but I know John also has them all so I don't need a copy people on Facebook commented

283
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,440
 Saying so Costanza Hoffman said that her impression is less was it all too serious?

284
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,800
 Which fair enough in order to get humor arises from having a bunch of people

285
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,920
 Who bounce off each other and generate humor if you're trying to do something on a shoestring

286
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,640
 Staff at the last minute. That's one of the things it's harder to set up and make happen

287
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,360
 I think let let this format develop also

288
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,880
 There's there's a sorts of humor that's that are gonna work in a paper newsletter

289
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,320
 But if you kind of shove them on screen as an item on a rotating slideshow might not work or might

290
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,680
 Shock somebody out of context or so you'd have to you would have to think quite hard about how you did it

291
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,560
 It's not trivial to see how you would make it funny memes or memes

292
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,720
 Yes memes

293
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
 Oh memes. I mean memes

294
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:16,800
 Convention related memes are good overheard at the convention things out of you know out quotes out of context that that they'd almost certainly work really well

295
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:23,320
 Jan Van Tint wrote in and said all newsletters. Yeah, I'm a fan of paper to the point out of helping out with the printing

296
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:31,000
 Jan won the Doc Wear award in no small part because of his huge services to printed newsletters over a

297
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
 number of years

298
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,000
 But he says having pick up points for paper news

299
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
 Preferably spiked with a plot to like humor helps those who know about it

300
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,960
 He notes that the newsletter Glasgow was on the website on the discord

301
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,160
 Which for him worked better than putting it on screens?

302
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,400
 I think I think I think I agree with both of those comments

303
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,720
 Tammy Coxon wrote in to say about death of emails the role was originated by Ben

304
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,520
 Yellow and he did it for most of the conventions where it's happened

305
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,720
 I was unaware of this because when I worked on lonkon 3 it was flick

306
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,000
 but

307
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,920
 I think that is an aberration and it has mostly been bent and it must be an enormous amount of work

308
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,200
 So we were talking last episode about you know

309
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,760
 Recruiting for that role, but I do wonder whether that would have actually been quite

310
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,480
 Difficult, so yes, thank you very much for writing in Tammy because I've been I'd been unaware of that

311
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,920
 I think having a lot of emails is less oppressive if you don't have to do anything with them

312
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,000
 I think it is it is a great role for someone who

313
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,440
 Really really wants to know everything about the world come because bear in mind that you will see everything

314
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,600
 So if you are the sort of person who lives for knowing exactly how the sausage is made you will see

315
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,600
 Every single ground up, you know who should do it Liz

316
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,600
 Alison you have just described Alison

317
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,680
 Yeah, if you if you like to every single tiny bit of the behind the scenes of the world con

318
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,480
 But without the obligation to do things about most of the emails then it is a great role now

319
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:04,080
 That is the person I am I mean I read not quite but nearly every messenger on the Glasgow server without really causing me any

320
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,680
 Stress or grief no, I mean I'm being slightly I'm being slightly jockey

321
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:16,480
 But I actually do think this might very much be Alison's skill set and so I'm just dropping Alison in it live on the pod for anyone listening from Seattle

322
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:24,680
 Really is that that's that's fine because my actual going forward major action plan in my life is to take things like that

323
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:30,320
 Put them on a list called who died and made you someone in honor of death lies there

324
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,720
 I might have mentioned this on the podcast before and I can put on that right in live time

325
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,280
 volunteer to take on the death of

326
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,280
 Emails role there we go and it could just sit on that list until one day I go

327
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,680
 Oh, yes, this is the year when I have 2000

328
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,840
 Unallocated hours to give to this but yeah, no, I am very very I mean one of my skill sets is

329
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,920
 Processing a lot of information very very quickly and identifying which people need to do which thing

330
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,560
 So let's move on to discussing the letters we got about the wuss first business meeting

331
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,920
 So we haven't discussed the wuss first business meeting yet listeners, but we'll discuss people's discussion of it

332
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,960
 So we heard from various people about the wuss first business meeting so june young wrote in and said congratulations for a

333
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,200
 He go in thank you very much to june

334
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,440
 She also mentions to Alison that she met Alison when Alison was in Wellington this year

335
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,200
 June was at the Wellington ferry luggage collection with a sign that had her name on it. Yes, sorry June June June very

336
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,680
 Graciously

337
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,920
 Yeah, she's Simon Littons partner and she helped me a huge about in all sorts of ways

338
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:43,920
 And I might have given her a terrible infection and I'm very sorry June mentions that she is listening from

339
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,680
 Episode 1

340
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,000
 So she started listening casually and then she went back right to the beginning and she's up to episode 34

341
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,080
 Hope you're enjoying those June

342
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,240
 I think if you're going to listen from episode 1 doing it after having listened to a couple of the modern ones is the way forward

343
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:04,280
 But yes, it's great for when she's doing dishwashing or housework. Yes, that is that is the glory of podcast

344
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,280
 She said she had to listen to the episode where you went over the Glasgow wuss first business meeting items twice

345
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,200
 Thanks for covering this I am in awe of anyone who listened to that twice

346
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,400
 That is 140 minutes of us talking about the business meeting that is dare de-occation

347
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,320
 I mean or if anyone who listened to it wants frankly

348
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,720
 Yeah, but June also mentioned she was one of the 30 people who turned up physically to the wuss first

349
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,160
 Business meeting in conzeland to defer all of the agenda items to the next year

350
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,600
 Wuss first really needs to make allowances in the event of health and safety reasons preventing an onsite meeting from occurring

351
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,720
 Thank you very much for being in top top letter not just because I agreed with it. We also heard from

352
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,360
 Christopher J. Garcia

353
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,040
 We have from Chris we've heard from Chris several times and basically he's gonna keep popping up through this episode

354
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,160
 He says I do wish we had virtual meetings throughout the year and the door was slightly open for it

355
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,040
 I think now we may get to this in a later episode

356
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,800
 But the door was slightly open to it by someone's a beating a proposal to have lots of virtual meetings throughout the year

357
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 And I think it did not pass

358
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,040
 Probably because it's added extremely complicated Chris also said he would love to see more advisory votes

359
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:15,160
 Though I fear that end up like the one this year or a sizable chunk voting in favor of the indie film Hugo was ignored by the business meeting

360
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,680
 Go figure

361
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,320
 That's tricky, right because lots of people in the advisory votes said they would be in favor of an indie film Hugo

362
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,640
 But then the people who are at the business meeting were like no, we all think this is terrible

363
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,960
 And so I mean I think it's good to have the advisory votes

364
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,480
 but what is the mechanism we are suggesting for bringing into the business meeting?

365
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,480
 I mean, this is a advisory vote and

366
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,400
 The problem is that the people who are actually in the build this business meeting is still gonna make their own minds up

367
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,840
 And obviously if one in the business meeting was pretty strongly against it

368
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,720
 So I mean I think it does speak to that proposal that no one has that the business meeting to vote it to speak in favor of it

369
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,400
 So why'd also I will just know it did lose the advisory vote. It was a vote that was lost and

370
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,760
 I sympathize with the fact that if you're on the losing side it must suck as someone who voted remain but

371
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,080
 It

372
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
 That's how votes work

373
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,720
 It's true the way we're if it won the advisory vote in a slam dunk or something and then the business meeting like nope

374
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,320
 Yeah, I would have been weirder

375
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,200
 But also I think the problem with the one Glasgow chose to to make the example of was that I'm not

376
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,240
 I think I probably am against an indie film Hugo as a as a sort of concept

377
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:34,160
 But I'm definitely against it as it was written in the vote that would have taken it into the Constitution

378
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:42,560
 Even if it was an idea I was passionately in favor of the one that was actually passed for ratification was was bad in

379
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,480
 TDS ways that would have made it difficult to actually implement. So I am glad it was struck down

380
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,360
 So it is a bit of an odd one from that perspective

381
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:57,840
 I guess I feel bad because in any other year that wasn't Chengdu that amendment would have been basically gently passed back for some more

382
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,280
 Revisions before being brought for ratification and pretty sure yeah, you know

383
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,840
 It was very unfortunate that it it got rat if it got put through in the first year and there were a few things that

384
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:17,240
 Probably shouldn't have been Nicholas White has made a long post about the 2024 consultative vote and a report on

385
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,640
 As as in his role as Hugo administrator with pointy ears

386
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,760
 And about about how they felt it went and what they've

387
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:33,400
 What they've learned from it and I will put a link I'll put a link in the show notes if anyone is interested

388
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,000
 Chris also says I am pretty sure John sounds like Martin Freeman looked circa 2001. Thanks Chris

389
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,080
 I think I'm just gonna put a picture of Martin Freeman from 2001 into our show notes and leave it there

390
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,760
 No sense at all. I mean done

391
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,120
 What doesn't make sense about it other opinions on what John sounds like a welcome please write it

392
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,520
 Yeah, it could have said that he sounds like what Martin Freeman looks like now

393
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,320
 I a 50 year old man

394
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,800
 So I think it's probably more flattering to John that he suggests that maybe where Martin Freeman was 30 he

395
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,360
 Looks like John sounds although I've got to say Martin Freeman looks pretty good now anyway true

396
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:20,920
 Raj says on Mastodon that lizz is the one that doesn't sound like she looks but he didn't verify in which way

397
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
 I

398
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,360
 Think it's like just be getting weird now. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean I don't disagree

399
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,920
 DC on the subject of

400
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:36,880
 The business meeting said thank you for the inoculation against any sense that they should go to the business meeting

401
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,040
 We restored them to sanity Duncan and Raj. I think

402
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:48,520
 Basically concurred. So yes, we we were thanked for our service in business meeting methadone

403
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,160
 And this is a shame because I I do quite want people to go to the business meeting

404
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,160
 I went to much for the business meeting at Shicon. It didn't unduly

405
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,400
 Disturb my enjoyment of the rest of the convention and it was all pretty interesting

406
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,040
 It's only that there was 20 hours this year

407
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,280
 Yeah, I don't I don't want to discourage people from going to the business meeting if they're interested in that sort of thing

408
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,120
 No, but I don't think we were um, I don't think we were very negative about business being

409
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,800
 I think we gave it a pretty good sort of relatively righ

410
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,000
 Shake and if listeners felt it sounded awful

411
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,600
 I would also say if it sounds awful

412
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,640
 I recommend not going because I don't want it to spoil people's enjoyment of a world con out of a sense of duty

413
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,600
 I do think it's a shame this year that it was in a different

414
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:38,600
 Location to the rest of com. I understand why but it means it's very hard to drop in for an hour without missing a load of other stuff

415
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,440
 Whereas I think if people could drop in for an hour

416
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,800
 Then that's the best way to know if you will enjoy something like the business meeting but being a 10 minute walk away

417
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,320
 May that more difficult? I am going to slightly push back on that and say that there were half hour

418
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,840
 gaps between program items

419
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,880
 So you could basically attend the business meeting for a program slot and not miss a huge amount of the rest was gone

420
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,560
 Just one program slot

421
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:06,280
 Which you could then pick up on catch up. I speak as someone who went to the business meeting for a program slot in order to vote against something

422
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,320
 But but I will say again

423
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,600
 I don't blame anyone who chose not to and this is mostly why I want it to happen separately from the world con

424
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,240
 So I very sincerely do not think that

425
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:25,120
 People prioritizing their enjoyment of the event they have spent usually for for digits sums of money to attend is a bad thing

426
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,640
 You know if it was on zoom and you had a free weekend it would be a different conversation

427
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,120
 But Glasgow cost me an excess of a thousand pounds and I wasn't spending a single minute of that convention doing anything

428
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,120
 I did not want to do and I think that is the right call go in peace listeners

429
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,880
 Gareth Kavanagh listened to that episode and said that he was a BM nerd and it was a good episode

430
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:53,080
 Thank you Gareth and I even sinner wrote in to say it was something that appealed to him as a civil servant and trade union rep

431
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
 Which yeah, I can see that

432
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,360
 Indeed so we did hear from a couple more people about the business meeting

433
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,560
 so we hit from Ed Moreland on blue sky and

434
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:10,320
 Ed's heated that two people they know have now listened to their first full episode of octoth up after the Hugo win

435
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,080
 And the good news is only one of them decided to start with the full breakdown of the business meeting agenda again

436
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,400
 We are sorry

437
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:27,480
 The person Laurie Laurie Burchall who was the listener they have replied and they have now listened to other episodes and are enjoying our game

438
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,480
 Recommendation, so thank you very much for that. We're sorry about the business meeting, but we hope you enjoyed it

439
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,680
 We did hear about stats membership attendance stats does anyone want to go into that?

440
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,480
 There's just two master bombs. Yes, because I can call you wrong, right?

441
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,160
 We touched briefly on the subject of

442
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,160
 Worldcon attendance numbers

443
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:55,240
 and whether Glasgow was bigger than some other world cons or not and I believe it was John

444
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,640
 Who said that they thought the Helsinki figures might be

445
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,320
 Invlated because they had not

446
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,840
 De-duplicated the day memberships and we heard from Tero on

447
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,120
 Mastodon who has it on good authority that they were de-duplicated

448
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,920
 So we're pretty sure that those Helsinki numbers are

449
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,800
 Accurate. Thank you very much. Terrell all right, then then I'll go for it. We also

450
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,320
 Discussed the number of first world con attendees. We thought they were and we heard from

451
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,280
 our analyt on

452
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,200
 Mastodon who thinks that the number of first world con goers was probably

453
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,240
 Underestimated on account of how that rate was more expensive than the Scottish resident rate

454
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,840
 So if you were a first-time attendee from Scotland

455
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,200
 You would probably pick the Scottish resident rate and not be counting those stats and that might also be why they ran out of first world

456
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,080
 Con ribbons because if they bought like based on first world con numbers plus a bit more

457
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,840
 And then it turns out there are a ton of Scottish first world con members that they hadn't counted that might explain why they ran out

458
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,520
 So thank you very much for that. Yeah, no, that was interesting. I hadn't thought of that, but it makes a lot of sense

459
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,400
 So Raj wrote in on a lock prepsode one one four

460
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,240
 Which was when we were talking about the Hugo finalists

461
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:16,200
 John he says he agrees with me about Alex Woodens translations. He struggled much more with theirs than with the others

462
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,720
 Which yes fair enough. Thank you Raj. I'm glad it wasn't just me

463
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:27,960
 Disagrees with Liz about the definition of romantic see I think fantasy romance is set on our world can definitely be part of the genre

464
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,680
 and

465
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,360
 noted of best series the Tricovsky is the only one I've not read anything off and I don't mind too much because being Tricovsky

466
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,280
 There'll be another trilogy due a week on Tuesday. So yeah, I'm reading some proper full-on romantic

467
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,640
 Listeners look forward for my opinions in a later episode Adrian Shikovsky apparently writes books faster than I read books, which is a

468
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,200
 problem

469
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,880
 I have read another agent. I cost key. I mean I don't know where to pick it just because I've picked on many other agent

470
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
 Ticosky

471
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,880
 Previously look right. You know my opinion on this Liz pick early pick often

472
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,220
 Oh, you were my opinion is there's no such thing as too much Adrian Shikovsky

473
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:12,480
 Right to say he's done Hugo reading for the first time in a decade and doing it even semi-controncibly is exhausting

474
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,200
 How do you keep up with it every year?

475
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,240
 And my answer is a sense of guilt and anxiety Raj. I just do some of it

476
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,640
 I mean I did the novels and some of the shorts, but not all of them

477
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,560
 But I mean now that we do the novels on the podcast that gives me some incentive to actually read them. I

478
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,680
 Read fast and I like free stuff

479
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,840
 That second bit is definitely true we also heard again from our on master don

480
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,160
 Saying the cute entertainment people deserve so much credit

481
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,920
 And that we should watch the cute data extravaganza on replay as it's not just very amusing for people like that

482
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,320
 And I am a person who likes that. They also actually include some insight into queuing etc

483
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,400
 Okay, I do like my stats with the side of insight

484
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,280
 So I will have to go and prioritize that one

485
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,960
 Do you want to plug back to the back to our futures here?

486
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,440
 So this is probably a great time to remind people that John and I along with

487
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:14,280
 Klebrile Emily and Andrew January and Meg Donald are running a small online convention for people who were members of

488
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,200
 Glasgow

489
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:22,200
 2024 that is attending members or online members whether or not you actually attended where you can watch the catch up and hang out with us

490
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,000
 all weekend which sounds like a fun thing to do and

491
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,520
 We'll put a link in the show notes for how you can express interest and it is a chance on the first third of November to

492
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,160
 Catch up with that catch up that you've been forgetting to catch up with even though catch up will be available

493
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,440
 Till the end of the year is that enough plagues for catch up John?

494
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,280
 Hey guys, we heard you like to catch up it will be good

495
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,440
 We will be there and there will be program and if you like either of those things it will be a good time

496
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,320
 We also heard from a lot of people lots of whom gave us congratulations many of whom gave us interesting

497
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,240
 comments and food for thought we

498
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,080
 Unfortunately can't read and react to all of them

499
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,600
 But I have put a list of them all in the show notes and we thank all of them and if I have missed you out

500
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,480
 I'm very sorry, but please let me know and I will add you in really we should have a scrolling YouTube

501
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,320
 Thread with sombre music for our black Christ, okay?

502
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,040
 Okay, sorry, maybe that was another magic. I will stop

503
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:31,420
 So this is a sad and potentially

504
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:37,880
 triggering discussion listeners, so there's a content warning for sexual assault in this part of the podcast but

505
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,040
 The news that Neil Gaiman has credible allegations of sexual assault against him came out

506
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,440
 Shortly before we didn't have a chance to record a bunch of normal episodes

507
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,640
 So we haven't really discussed it obviously

508
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,200
 I'm very sad about this because I'm a huge fan of his art

509
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,760
 but apparently not the man himself and

510
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,320
 We have put links in the show notes to various bits and bobs on this if you'd like to eat more

511
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,360
 But yeah, I don't have much to add to all of the reporting that's already happened

512
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,560
 So do go and do go and read that yes, and what's come up very recently is

513
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,720
 That they have canceled a couple of potential adaptations and also they've put a pause on

514
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,440
 Filming of the third season of good omens

515
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,080
 So it's now kind of not clear when that will continue or who will be in charge

516
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,920
 Yeah, and I think I just hope that these revelations coming out about Neil Gaiman one

517
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,720
 There are a lot of people who were big fans of his and he has always been a person who I think people have

518
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,340
 Quite intense parasocial relationships with he's not someone I've ever met or interacted with but I know you know

519
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,120
 I know there are people I know who are friends of his and I know there are people

520
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:53,520
 I know who have always kind of admired him as a greater and for how how much he puts himself out there and supports different causes

521
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,160
 Online and seems to be very friendly with his fans and obviously that's now taken on a darker tone

522
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,520
 And I hope anyone who was a big fan of his is dealing okay with the news and that anyone whose

523
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,320
 Lively hoods are also tied to him. There are a lot of people who work on

524
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:16,520
 TV and film adaptations are a lot of people who are working on good omens whose jobs have presumably now been put on pause and we hope this all

525
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:23,540
 Resolve successfully. I will note that Gaiman is also basically deploying to make any public comment at all since July

526
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:29,160
 I'm not entirely sure if there's any way in which this could resolve successfully

527
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,400
 I mean it will resolve at some point

528
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,120
 I know a lot of people have close personal friends of Gaiman and I know and a lot of people who are outraged by this story and some of those

529
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,120
 People are the same people, you know, and I don't know any more than the reporting

530
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,200
 I mean and I know that I guess it's my job to comment on podcasts

531
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,000
 But some of these stories absolutely horrified me out

532
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 You know and and they had a degree of plausibility about them as well that I think and there's a lot of them

533
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,920
 Future world cons

534
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,000
 There are gonna be some more world con listeners one of them is gonna be in Seattle and

535
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,240
 Allison foreshadowed a thing that they're doing I did

536
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,120
 Seattle is having a poetry Hugo a well off poetry Hugo some people are like well

537
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:27,020
 There should be a pur to hugo all the time, but I think that's it's got the same problem that some of the other suggestions have

538
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:32,680
 Which is that the field is is large and and the Hugo voters aren't necessarily paying attention to it

539
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,160
 But we will see how it goes next year the poem has to be at least three lines long so

540
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,260
 if you write a haiku and you can you can be eligible for the

541
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,360
 poetry Hugo

542
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,240
 That seems like quite a low bar for for winning a hugo so it would better be a very very good

543
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,840
 Hiku readers right in and we will have the octa for

544
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,800
 Hugo eligible haiku corner next episode. Oh, that's some point in the future

545
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:04,600
 As you see Sandra wrote a sub home that is eligible. There are many many other really solid science fiction poems

546
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,920
 For example, not for this what year but in the past Harry Josephine Giles is Deep Wheel Ocadia, which won

547
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,360
 The arthsea clock award would be the sort of thing that you would expect mate might turn up on

548
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:22,400
 a best poetry ballot so I am looking forward to seeing what people come up with and

549
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,680
 If you're thinking if you read a lot of science fiction poetry and you are thinking of nominating in this category

550
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:35,680
 Please write in and tell us what good science fiction poetry we should be reading and also they are going to have a

551
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:42,120
 Judged film festival, which is something I think we have mentioned on the pod as a good idea

552
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,960
 But I think this is a great idea

553
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,960
 I really do think that it is

554
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,720
 Something that I think I'd love to see more world cons do I do appreciate it must be a hell of a lot of work

555
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,000
 And I'm not saying I think every world cons should do it

556
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,880
 I do also wonder slightly about the fact that they're doing it

557
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:04,280
 Given the LA is the next one because I assume LA might want to do things with a film as well, but I think this is really good

558
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,880
 I'm curious to see how much of it is available for people who are not there on site or for catch up

559
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,480
 But it will be good

560
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,160
 Yeah, no, I think this is a spectacular idea and we definitely did plug it

561
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,640
 So hopefully they got the idea from us, but if it was a separate idea that seems good too

562
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,800
 Now I'm looking I'm excited about both of those

563
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,000
 But I may be as I may be an online member of Seattle. I may not be there in person so

564
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,760
 Because it's expensive to go to Seattle and I want to know that I'm gonna have good time

565
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,880
 I think the poetry Hugo is interesting because what I've mostly seen

566
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,000
 Being discussed after they announced this is people going where do I find good science fiction poetry then?

567
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,960
 So there might be a chance to bring a lot of venues to people's attention

568
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,240
 And I do hope we get some kind of slightly more

569
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,400
 substantial in in length and content than haiku

570
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,880
 nominees for it, but I'm not a regular reader of poetry. So I really have very

571
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,560
 little to suggest for this one. It's gonna be interesting

572
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,920
 Film festivals, I think it's been a while since we had a a film

573
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:13,400
 Program at a world con and doing it as a full kind of judge film festival where you can submit your films and everything

574
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,680
 It sounds like a really neat idea and I hope it goes well for them

575
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,720
 Yeah, me too

576
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,240
 But it'd be interesting to know if there are actually a substantial number of people attending world cons who want to spend their time

577
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,440
 Watching films, which unless they are sort of short films probably requires like a substantial investment of time

578
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,800
 And I know when I go to world cons generally there's other stuff I want to be doing more than watching a film

579
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,880
 I might be able to watch at some other point. So that's kind of my

580
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:43,160
 You know argument against why you might want to do that, but we will we will see how it goes

581
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,920
 I support them like doing things that other world cons have not done for a while and trying some new stuff

582
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,480
 That's how we discover what works and what doesn't. Yeah

583
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,480
 I think that in the past we used to have a lot of films at conventions

584
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,800
 Historically and we did it because you couldn't just go and get films right they they weren't available

585
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,720
 And and so having rare science fiction films at conventions was always quite a big draw for people

586
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,200
 What the case is now is that there's a lot of independent films that don't have distribution

587
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,960
 And it is actually very hard to see those films and getting them into a film festival that's connected to the world con

588
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,200
 Is a way for film fans to see them and everyone at a world con has

589
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,360
 Choices to make about how they're going to spend their time. So some people like to sit in the business meeting all weekend

590
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:31,320
 I understand but some people will want definitely already at world cons a film

591
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,280
 Will want to go to this film festival because we will need sharks to see films that they aren't likely to be able to see elsewhere

592
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,800
 There are many many science fiction short films that are

593
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:46,600
 Almost impossible for most people to watch so so I think yeah having those available

594
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,120
 Especially like because it's definitely true that most of the blockbusters are

595
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:57,320
 Relatively easily watched because even if they don't get official releases in your territory that often available through other means

596
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,680
 But john remember how hard it was to watch gods in the minus one

597
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:09,160
 Yep

598
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:15,640
 And it's a testament to its quality that it's almost got onto the hugo ballot despite it being almost impossible to watch

599
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,800
 Yeah, I I guess the thing is whether does sticking this onto a world con mean that a lot of world con go is go

600
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,600
 Oh, I can see some films. I'll do it mean you end it with sort of a short film festival which exists inside the world con

601
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:32,280
 Almost exclusively viewed by people who have chosen to come for the kind of film festival nature

602
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,000
 I think this is a case in which I don't mind either of those happening

603
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,440
 But also like most other things it will be somewhere in the middle. I for example

604
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:48,760
 I don't normally play games very much at conventions because I think well I could play those games at other times

605
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,160
 But lots of people like to play games

606
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,200
 As part of what they do at the convention as some people like to play games is all of what they do at convention

607
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,840
 And I think i'd fill kiss another thing where people do it

608
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,880
 Some of the time or all of the time and I think that's fine

609
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,400
 both those sorts of

610
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,000
 Fans are very welcome at the world con and and some of them will

611
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,200
 And film fans will do that come in those two types

612
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,400
 I'm sure and I could definitely see that there'll be films where people go

613
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,160
 Well, I'm not generally going to see a film festival at this convention

614
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,400
 But I'm very excited to see that particular film and I will go and see that one

615
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,000
 Because one film seems not unreasonable for five days of the world con

616
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,840
 But yeah, I think this is great. Um on the subject of

617
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,800
 LA LA con five looks good

618
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:39,480
 It was seated at the Glasgow world con and received 450 out of the 530 votes cast

619
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,280
 And so yeah, well done to LA. We discussed it. I think a little bit of the live episode

620
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,120
 I think I went gosh. Well, look at their guests aren't they good because they are and you need lots of other stuff to be a good

621
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,960
 Well, con but you know, they're guests are good

622
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,200
 Also, it's in Anaheim and I have other interests maybe in Anaheim

623
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,000
 Um, so Tel Aviv in 2027

624
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,680
 We speculated on a previous episode that we weren't sure whether that was still a going concern

625
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,040
 But they had a table at Glasgow. So um, so I guess it is

626
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,760
 And if anyone would like to go to a 2027 world con in Tel Aviv

627
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,280
 More power to you

628
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,520
 Seems very strange to me, but you know takes all kinds

629
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,400
 I think it'll have a lot of americans at it

630
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,320
 I mean, I I think there were you know, there was a lot of discussion about having an a world con in israel

631
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,240
 Even before

632
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,720
 Essentially the entirety of israel was a place where the government advises you not to travel to it

633
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,800
 Yeah

634
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,840
 I have two things to say about the Brisbane in 2028 bid

635
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,720
 One is that they have changed their dates in order to align with an eclipse

636
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,680
 Well to slightly offset an eclipse

637
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,040
 Well, they're not going to be in uh late august anymore. They are going to be in july

638
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,520
 So that you can go and visit the solar eclipse and then go to the world con

639
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,920
 Which yeah, I mean it seems like a

640
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:05,640
 Good strategy except it might backfire if it turns out it's incredibly expensive to go to Brisbane at that time

641
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:13,640
 Because of the eclipse. I'm actually looked up the path of the solar eclipse in 2028. I'm just doing that. I mean australia's

642
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:21,640
 australia's a big place and this this is the zone of totality goes along a lot of place a lot of australia here

643
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,960
 Yes, but no like

644
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,560
 No offense to australians, but it goes across the zone of you know

645
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,880
 The zone of totality does go across a big chunk of australia where not a lot of people live

646
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,120
 And I think this one is only in visible from australia, New Zealand

647
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,400
 Which is another thing right? It's not like that this one is visible from you know

648
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,360
 The u.s and the uk and australia this one is one that you can only see from australia and New Zealand

649
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,640
 immediately it goes through sindy not through britsman

650
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:54,680
 But I think it's going to be interesting to know if this makes it incredibly expensive to fly there considering most people would probably want to fly into

651
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,440
 Sydney

652
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,000
 Because I suspect there's a lot more flights to sydney than there are to britsman

653
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,760
 You may need to sort your dates because most people will go for a longer trip if they're going to australia

654
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,480
 I would recommend going to australia for a longer trip

655
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,600
 So you you might need to tweak your travel times a little bit. It may make some things more expensive

656
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,080
 I think if you avoid the eclipse your

657
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,800
 Trip will probably not be a great deal more expensive

658
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,640
 But if you do not avoid the eclipse obviously there's a kind of eclipse premium on

659
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,480
 On anywhere to stay anywhere in an eclipse zone of totality

660
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:32,280
 I also say that they have pre-support at the levels of lobster and pineapple. Whoa, can I get both?

661
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,520
 Well, as we've established

662
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,480
 Alison is susceptible to cool rewards and fun names for pre-support

663
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,720
 So basically everyone should be calling their pre-support moves or something so you can sell one exclusively to it exclusively to alison

664
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,600
 I recommend setting it around maybe 250 dollars

665
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,120
 You can also be

666
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:58,280
 What is often known as a friend of the bid but in Brisbane you can be a mate or a young mate or a great mate

667
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,360
 If you want to give them even more money, which is

668
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,120
 Pretty good

669
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,800
 Yeah, those are great. Those are great names. I love it

670
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,200
 amazing

671
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,880
 Mate of the bid is fun and it's 250 dollars

672
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,160
 so

673
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,720
 Yeah, 250 australian dollars, which is like

674
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,160
 Less than an American dollar like two

675
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,200
 It's like twice the American dollar here. It's just peanuts to space. Look

676
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,640
 So yeah, good stuff

677
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:38,680
 And then just before we do picks

678
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,000
 We should mention that there is a

679
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,960
 Phanak history zoom on the secret history of plotter which will star Steve Davis zoom asan

680
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,880
 Alison Scott and mike scott and

681
00:52:51,880 --> 00:53:00,280
 If one of them is familiar it is because it is Alison and it will have happened just before this episode drops due to a slight

682
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,920
 Cock up on the announcing on the plugging things we're doing front

683
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,680
 But you can see it on the phanak.org youtube channel

684
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,480
 which we will put in the show notes and

685
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,120
 And a reminder that the fan act.org youtube channel is

686
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,160
 eligible for best fan cast and I think they do

687
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,640
 fabulous work in surfacing

688
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,760
 People who've got some understanding of bits of fan history and and learning about it by

689
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:32,520
 Basically asking them what actually went down and the people going oh, I don't really remember because i'm 89

690
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,480
 So I this is why plotter is trying to do this before we get too old to remember

691
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,960
 Sensible there were nine

692
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,640
 Nine entities in the plot to capal and so far the only one of them who has died was the cat

693
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,920
 So, you know, that's a good time to be doing these things rather than when you go when you start going

694
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,040
 Oh, it would be nice to hear from from so-and-so, but they're dead now

695
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,000
 Oh

696
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,320
 Kido key so picks we must be nearly there now picks picks picks. Does do you have a pick? Uh, yeah, I do a pick

697
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,760
 I was just deciding

698
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,520
 I'm gonna pick control

699
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:11,240
 Which is a video game from 2019 because I am up to date with the state of modern video games and so on

700
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:17,720
 Um, it's like an actually adventure game. I believe it is connected to the allen weight games

701
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,640
 Which I haven't played well, basically it's a sort of action adventure where you

702
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:30,200
 Go into the federal bureau of control, which is what seems like a regular if dated office building and turns out to contain

703
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:37,560
 Multitudes because the federal bureau of control is the one that looks after basically all the supernatural happenings in the world

704
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:43,320
 And there's a whole plot going on but mostly you play as someone with supernatural powers and

705
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
 a gun with

706
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
 Mostly infinite ammo

707
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,280
 And you go around battling the mysterious creatures who've been taken over by a supernatural entity called the hiss

708
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,200
 So you spend a lot of time

709
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,760
 You know shooting enemies, but you can also throw things at them lift them up throw them around

710
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:04,360
 Mind to draw them and so on so you get to combine like having supernatural powers and having a gun

711
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,560
 and

712
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,920
 All the time you are kind of picking up little like found letters and so on

713
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:15,560
 That are like case reports and notes and memos between people and files that kind of fill in all the backstory of this supernatural world

714
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,280
 And occasionally you have to do things like oh to get to this place

715
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,000
 You have to go through the motel and you flick a light switch

716
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,600
 And you end up in a mysterious motel and have to figure out how to find your way through this motel puzzle in order to open up

717
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,640
 The next bit of the world and it's just it's pretty nicely done

718
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,560
 The graphics are pretty good some of the kind of like surface textures

719
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,600
 I mean i'm not someone who normally goes oh surface textures

720
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,240
 But there's some bits of sort of like where you're supposed to be walking over like marble surfaces, which are pretty cool

721
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,280
 You get to speak to these supernatural entities

722
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,480
 Who used your world words a lot in a kind of cool way

723
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:53,000
 And like you go around corners and there's always like mysterious whispering and things like that and then like a big

724
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,880
 Monster will come out that you have to kill before it explodes in your face and it's pretty good

725
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,480
 Nice

726
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,440
 It is yes, it is in the same universe as allan week i think um but but yeah

727
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,400
 I've heard of it. I have not played it. I kind of on my list ever since enjoying

728
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,320
 allan week two so um so yeah interesting pick

729
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,160
 Frank's Liz

730
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:21,560
 So my pick is chaos, which is a tv show on netflix, which is currently my um

731
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,080
 most valuable streaming service given all the games as well

732
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,440
 um

733
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:34,280
 I don't this seems very strange to me because I've I've not net generally been a big netflix person, but here we go um chaos is a

734
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,480
 human accommodate drama

735
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,520
 where the

736
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,240
 gods the greek gods are

737
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:48,600
 Running the world and the world is kind of slightly like contemporary world

738
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,240
 But probably is a little bit more like a 90s world

739
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,520
 Because in particular there are no mobile phones that being made more straightforward to make the plot work

740
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:03,480
 It stars jeff goldbloom as Zeus and he has been very jeff goldbloomish and that that's kind of gives you a sense of the

741
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,440
 flavor and there are

742
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:13,240
 All sorts of interesting people as many of the gods and other characters from greek mythology their stories are

743
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,560
 Slightly changed they're changed enough so that you never quite know what is going on

744
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,840
 But if you're familiar with greek myths, you will be familiar with a lot of the things going on here

745
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,480
 And I we are finding it very funny and I haven't quite finished it and I suspect when I do finish it

746
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,400
 I'll be like oh well

747
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,480
 Some of the big reveal stuff is not quite as exciting as it might have been but the actual

748
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,200
 The journey has been jolly entertaining and very amusing

749
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,080
 There is a very amusing underworld

750
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,280
 Um, which is all shown in black and white

751
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,320
 Um, so that you know when you're in the underworld billy piper is casandra

752
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,000
 um

753
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,360
 And nobody believes so which is probably a a shame because she's generally right that being casandra

754
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:02,200
 And it's just generally a great and enjoyable show that will not trouble you too much

755
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,920
 I understand that the more you know about greek myths the more you're getting out of this

756
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,600
 So people who are have been paying attention all the way along

757
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,840
 Like it even more and people who just kind of vaguely remember reading a couple of books on myths in school

758
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,920
 um kind of

759
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,880
 Like it but but it's it's got a lot of deep cut jokes for the for the real fans

760
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,000
 Um, and it's very funny really liking it

761
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,720
 And a lot of people are talking about it. So I'm sorry

762
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,400
 I'm just kind of joining a crowd of a lot of people who are talking about it. No, it's good

763
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,120
 Finger on the pulse

764
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,120
 It's eight episodes

765
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,680
 I'm gonna pick alien rombulous

766
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,840
 It's an imperfect film. I don't think like you know, it's not a stone cold classic

767
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,240
 But it is it is okay

768
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,400
 And god knows I think

769
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,880
 Having the first alien movie that's okay that has been released in my lifetime is worthy of celebration

770
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:04,840
 So alien and aliens are obviously very great and they came out in 1979 1986 and then in 2024

771
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,680
 We finally have a alien movie that will not make you

772
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,200
 Want to throw it in the sea after you've seen it, which is lovely

773
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:19,160
 So I will say I think one of the things the movie does really well is it has characters in it who make terrible decisions

774
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:24,840
 But it shows you enough of their trauma for it to be very obvious while they're why they're making the terrible decisions

775
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,480
 And so although characters do make objectively the wrong decision in several points

776
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:34,920
 You never doubt that that person would have made that decision in that context, which I think is a very good

777
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,040
 um

778
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:41,000
 Piece of character work. I will say I enjoyed it much more than a spanya

779
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,160
 Who thought it was okay until the ending which I think it's fair to say she detested

780
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,560
 So, um, I think it's a great movie. I think a lot of people in it are are pretty good

781
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,760
 But I think david johnson who plays the android is

782
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,000
 Absolutely superlative. Um, I hope he is in many more things

783
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,320
 He has been in other things previously that I am not familiar with

784
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,400
 Um, but I'm hoping he goes on to to many other things because um

785
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:10,360
 I really liked him. It's very good. It's also got Ian home in it, which is a bit strange

786
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,760
 So you know how you make me feel old sometimes

787
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,400
 I'm not intending to read

788
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:26,440
 So fun fact I snuck into alien which was an r-rated movie a couple of days before my 14th birthday

789
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,080
 And I think it might be the traumatic experience that put me off or up for life

790
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,520
 But I have seen alien and alien since I would agree that they were very good

791
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:39,000
 But have not not felt a strong urge to see other films in the series

792
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,040
 I mean pre-theuses unmittigated wank

793
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,120
 Also

794
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:50,040
 Not in the cinema because this is I don't want if I have to go and shut the movie off or go and hide behind the sofa for half

795
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,080
 An hour or whatever

796
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:55,480
 I don't want to do that in a cinema or I want to do it in the comfort of my own home entirely firm

797
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,880
 And I think I also like movies like this sort of smaller screen where they're less scary

798
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,520
 Oh, it is very it was very scary. Okay. I wouldn't I would not say it was that scary

799
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,000
 I think there are horror films which are way scarier because they are

800
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,280
 Going for it. This is just like occasionally an alien is going to pop up, but you know an alien is going to pop up

801
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:19,720
 So yeah, I enjoyed it. I can't I can't quantify like how much did I enjoy it because it's an alien film

802
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,720
 And I think that does add a few bits, but actually I think if it was just a

803
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:29,320
 We have taken a bunch of young people and they are on a spaceship with some mysterious enemies

804
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,600
 and there's a

805
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,960
 Oh an android of dubious loyalties and so on

806
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,120
 I probably still quite enjoy it and you could also cut off the last 50 minutes, which are nonsense

807
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,520
 But otherwise, yeah, I really enjoyed it

808
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:46,360
 That was the OptiThought podcast and it's goodbye for me. It's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me

809
01:01:46,360 --> 01:02:06,360
 *Music*

810
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:11,240
 Do you want to read one of them and then I'll do another one? I could do can I?

811
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,080
 Well, I was taught a lot and we don't want to give people too much lids because it might be more than they can handle

812
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,840
 Well, that's the aftershoes. That's good
