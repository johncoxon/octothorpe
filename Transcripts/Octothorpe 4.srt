1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,960
Liz, do you fancy a quick game of Arkham Horror before Alison's ready to?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,880
Sorry, guys!

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,280
I mean, if it makes you feel any better, we're having a lot of fun.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:24,380
Hello everyone and welcome to episode four of Octothorpe, a podcast about science fiction

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,920
and science fiction fandom. I'm John Coxon.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,120
I'm Alison Scott.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,260
And I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:36,240
And we are coming to you two weeks after Easter, at which we had our first live show,

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,580
which had many comments in the chat, as some of our favourite podcast hosts say.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,400
How did you feel that the live recording went?

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:52,200
I thought it was full of drivel and distractions and people not really keeping on topic,

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,560
and it went on far too long. And then when I listened to the edit, it sounded more or less

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,920
all right. So I think that's what we're aiming for, right?

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,220
Yeah. And Liz was good.

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,620
Yeah, I think we've peaked and it's just going to be downhill from now on.

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,820
But maybe we can hope for a very slow decline over some time.

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:16,220
So Eastercon had a variety of virtual components this year, owing to gestures out of window.

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,480
How did we think the Zoom bit session?

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,120
I think they put a load of work into it. I think Keith Smith and his team essentially stepped

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,820
up to the plate and worked out how they would do it and make it work well. And it did work

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,400
well. It seemed to run very smoothly. I think it was obviously a very different sort of experience

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,780
for the people presenting, especially poor Phil, who's been sick with the plague and sort of came

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:48,060
off his deathbed in order to do his presentation for 2022. But I think the actual mechanical running

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,820
of it in many ways worked better than our regular bid session, which I think is something that

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,000
parliaments around the world are finding as well, that it turns out that when you stop people

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,800
catcalling and interrupting and generally acting like loons, you get a better democratic outcome.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,300
I think in some cases, it was quite hard to do the questions by text, because if you're doing them

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,840
live in the room, people can get a lot of context from you and the way you say it. And I think there

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,380
were some questions that maybe got misunderstood, or we did not get quite the answer that the questioner

30
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,360
was looking for. But other than that, it was pretty good. It was a good start. It meant I

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,540
could go to the bid session, which otherwise I would not have been doing. So that was quite nice.

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,680
And did you vote for an Easter con?

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,480
I did vote for an Easter con. Yeah, I mean, essentially, it's back to Birmingham again.

34
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,900
I don't mind a Birmingham Hilton. Perfectly reasonable place for an Easter con. We didn't go this year.

35
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,900
So let's go next year.

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,440
For those who don't know, the 2021 Easter con will be confusion in 2021. It will be held at the

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,880
Birmingham Hilton Metropole. The guests of honour, as far as we remember, were Dan Agnett,

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,620
Nick Vincent and Dave Lally. But the list is not on the website yet. So we apologise sincerely if we

39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,120
have forgotten one. I am excited about confusion. But one thing I do want to touch on is that my

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,460
understanding is that the Birmingham Hilton Metropole was chosen as the location before the COVID-19

41
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,500
situation arose. And so it's interesting that this, I think, was the first time we would have

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,320
gone back to a hotel in back-to-back years for a long time. I know, I think it's happened in the

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,660
dim and distant past. But what do you think about having Easter con in the same place two years in a row?

44
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,660
I think it's becoming increasingly difficult to find hotels. The other thing that was announced

45
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:49,340
at Easter was that Phil Dyson is kind of a bid presumptive for 2022, but didn't want to bid

46
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:58,640
because he hasn't nailed a hotel down yet. And I think some of the sites that we might have used in

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,500
the past are not acceptable to us now. Some of them are out of our price range now. The Easter con

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,980
becomes more demanding in what it needs every year. Easter con is, it's kind of stable in size. You have to

49
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,420
actually work to prevent it from growing. But it's around about a thousand, which is quite a difficult

50
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:23,280
size to put into hotels in the UK. And so there just aren't that many sites. And I think Liz said, oh,

51
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,860
the Hilton Birmingham Metropole is a perfectly good site. But in fact, it was quite a lot better than that

52
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,520
last time we went. It really did have, apart from being on a motorway junction, pretty well everything

53
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:43,700
you would want an Easter con site to have, like local shops and restaurants and beer and good cheap food

54
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,820
and plenty of function space and plenty of bedrooms to the extent that they don't have to use an overflow.

55
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,600
Everyone always gets into the hotel. And I think that's quite compelling. I can see that having

56
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,040
negotiated it once, I can see that Vanessa would want to go back. The other thing I wanted to say

57
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,940
about Confusion 2021 is that the other thing I want to talk about Confusion 2021 is that although

58
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,640
Vanessa is chairing again, it's otherwise a different committee. She's got some, I think a couple of the

59
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,580
same people working on the convention, but the overall committee has new people on it. And in particular,

60
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,800
I don't think it's got its programme head in place yet. So it's a different committee to the committee

61
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
that will go to give us the Easter con this year.

62
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,880
Yeah, you're right. I'm probably a little bit unfair to the Hilton. It's also, it was noticeably

63
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,420
better last time we went than the time before, because a lot more shops and restaurants and

64
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,200
everything have grown up around that development. So it's less kind of in the middle of nowhere,

65
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,640
and there's nowhere else to go and eat, and more in the middle of other things. And I think that made

66
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,660
the hotel more competitive about feeding us because we actually have other options. They're not the only game

67
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,000
in town. It also has extremely good transportation links as well.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,520
Yes, it does. And I think one of the things I remember about the first time we went was that the

69
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,360
food situation was not really very good. And the most recent time we went, it was a lot better. So I agree

70
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,860
with you that the growth of the complex nearby, it's got a Nando's and a Pizza Express and other chain

71
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,280
restaurants. So it's nothing particularly to write home about, but it just gives you a lot more option

72
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,780
than you had before. It also has one of the best restaurants in the Midlands. So it actually,

73
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,480
as well as having its cheap restaurants, it's also got a couple of really high-end restaurants. So it

74
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,040
was filling that niche for people who wanted to go and do a bit of fine dining as well.

75
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,820
Excellent. And it does have very, very good function space. In fact, it's got more function space than

76
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,500
an Eastercon can use, which is unusual for a hotel.

77
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:45,020
The other thing that had changed in between our two more recent visits is that they'd had the furries,

78
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:52,440
I think a couple of times. And I think the furries are more or less exactly like the Eastercon,

79
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,140
except with more fur. And so they really knew how to serve a crowd that was like that.

80
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, I think as hotels get used to conventions, they get more and more keen to have conventions,

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,840
because I think conventions are a usually relatively well-behaved group of people who will spend an inordinate

82
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,580
amount of food and drink while being very polite and quiet.

83
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,020
I think that was clear in the difference between the Hilton the two times we went.

84
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,540
And I think it stands in stark contrast to the Radisson Edwardian, which was one of the

85
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:28,640
common Eastercon hotels of yesteryear, because they got progressively worse and always treated the

86
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,000
convention attendees as a lower class of hotel guests than the non-convention attendees,

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,080
which I think left a very poor taste in the mouth and led to an awful lot of

88
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,580
dissatisfaction with that as a venue. So I think that the Hilton Metropole does a much better job

89
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,660
from that perspective too. I'm happy we're going back. I really like that hotel. I find it very easy

90
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,660
to get to because it's a direct train from Southampton. There are lots of hotels around if you don't want

91
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,880
to stay in the con hotel, but there's plenty of room in the con hotel if you do. And it's generally a very

92
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,920
good location. So I am excited to go in 2021.

93
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,520
I just want to go to an Eastercon anywhere, anytime, ever again. Oh, sorry.

94
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,700
Not Easter? I mean...

95
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,460
One of the things that surprised me about the bid session was there was a question about what would

96
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,680
happen if COVID-19 meant that there were still travel restrictions in place at Easter next year.

97
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,800
And the concom said that they hadn't really thought about that and hadn't put any plans in place.

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,620
What do you think about that? Do you think that's sensible?

99
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:36,060
I was appalled by how little planning they did this year. I mean, obviously, having to cancel

100
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:43,780
your Eastercon is terrible. But I feel that they could have done a lot more in the four weeks or

101
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,380
five weeks between when they cancelled and the original dates to make sure that virtual events

102
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,560
were happening and were encouraged, even if they hadn't done all the work of organising them

103
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,300
themselves. What they actually did was sent out a thing saying, please don't organise any events

104
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,060
because we're going to let you know, which was the exact opposite of what I think they should have

105
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,720
done. I understand that if it had been my Eastercon being cancelled, I might have been too busy

106
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,120
crying into my beer to think about what alternatives we could have. But it would have been quite

107
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,160
straightforward to have set up social spaces, to have set a system in place so that panels could have

108
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,860
happened, to say, we're going to have some chats about some topics you might be interested in that

109
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,760
you could sign up to be on a panel on or something like that. And they could have done all of that and

110
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,040
they didn't do any of it. And that was for this year. So I was very keen to say Eastercons or all

111
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,780
conventions in the future should have some planning arrangements for this sort of thing and should be

112
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:52,520
planning to do virtual things so that they could switch if they need to. And I was surprised that

113
00:09:52,520 --> 00:10:00,020
they didn't. I feel that they missed an opportunity. I feel that although, as they said, doing it properly

114
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:06,900
can be quite expensive, you can do it improperly with not a lot of work, as we've all discovered in the last

115
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,640
six weeks. I think I'm not surprised that they didn't do anything because I think that it was very clearly a big shock to everyone that this developed as quickly as it did. Like intellectually, I knew it was going to, but sort of emotionally, I think it really hit me that like, this is the first Easter for a very long time that I've not gone to an Eastercon. So that was a bit of a shock to the system. And so I think I can understand why they might not have been able to arrange anything this time round. And I

116
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,380
It was very clearly a big shock to everyone that this developed as quickly as it did.

117
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:28,960
Like intellectually, I knew it was going to, but sort of emotionally, I think it really hit me that like this is the first Easter for a very long time that I've not gone to an Easter con.

118
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,740
So that was a bit of a shock to the system.

119
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,820
And so I think I can understand why they might not have been able to arrange anything this time around.

120
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,040
And I appreciate that's a very hard thing.

121
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,160
And I appreciate that that could have been very fraught.

122
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:49,700
What I am sort of hoping is that if there are still travel restrictions next year, we don't end up in a situation where, again, we have no official Easter con provision.

123
00:10:49,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Because I don't want to end up in a situation where this kind of thing happens again with no official panels or official social spaces or anything like that.

124
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,160
I think I can understand and sympathize with what happened this year.

125
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:17,100
I think if you are planning to do Easter con next year, it is just prudent to assume that you are not going to know until closer time how it's going to work.

126
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,920
I think it's just prudent to plan for if you have to do a remote Easter con or if you want to even include some remote options.

127
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,340
Because clearly the last thing that's going to come back is large gatherings of people.

128
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,420
And the last thing that's going to come back is long distance travel.

129
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,640
So you might be in the position where we can have a full Easter con.

130
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
You might be in the position where you have a reduced Easter con.

131
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,920
Or you might be in the position where you have no Easter con.

132
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,500
And I think it's at this point you just have to have contingency plans for those.

133
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:53,620
And if you don't, then you're going to have another year of planning to run a great convention and then being extremely disappointed if you can't do that.

134
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:05,400
I think there is a fourth option, which is that they may have a lot of members who, even if travel is allowed and the Easter con is allowed, have decided for themselves that it's not safe to do so.

135
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:20,000
And I think the notion that we might disenfranchise our oldest and in poorest health members, not because they can't physically get to the convention, but that we don't think that they don't think it's safe for them to do so.

136
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,620
And that even with a year's warning, nobody's doing anything about that.

137
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,200
And when they were asked the question, we're kind of like, well, we've got no plans to do anything about that.

138
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,040
I feel like there's a lot more that could be done here.

139
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:44,640
I agree. And I think it will be really interesting to see what does happen next year, because obviously I think all three of us are very much hoping that Easter con will happen and everything will be normal and there will be none of this that needs to be worried about.

140
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:51,020
But I am keenly aware that me hoping that happens and it's actually happening are two very different things.

141
00:12:51,020 --> 00:13:03,540
I think the other interesting point here is that, especially with Worldcon, but with Easter con as well, I think the idea of having panels one can access virtually,

142
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:12,300
from the perspective of being able to buy a supporting membership and do that is something that has been being talked about more and more in recent years.

143
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,760
And I am wondering whether this will be a shove towards trying to start making that happen.

144
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:30,160
And I am hoping that this is the shove that starts making that happen, because I often find myself in situations at Easter cons where I end up missing a panel that I would love to go back and see a recording of,

145
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:39,380
or I end up being on a panel where I would love to watch it back because I think there were some really interesting points made and I'm not able to take notes as thoroughly as I'd like to while talking.

146
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:47,080
So I think it would be really nice if we could develop that capability and this seems like a good, almost like a good excuse to try and do that.

147
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,320
Do you two think that this will be an impetus towards that?

148
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,040
Do you think I'm being overly optimistic?

149
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,720
I think you're right.

150
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,100
I think that everyone would like more things to be streamed, live broadcast recorded for later consumption.

151
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:15,180
And this could be a good opportunity because the benefit here is that you could plan your convention panel so they can either happen live at the Easter con with a streaming broadcast or they can happen live from people's houses with a streaming broadcast.

152
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,140
And then in either situation, you are already prepared.

153
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:25,320
I think the best way to do this is to have some of the panels planned that way.

154
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:44,120
So rather than saying we're going to try and recreate the 420 items at an Easter con or whatever, we've got a lot, which includes all sorts of items which nobody in their right minds will put on the internet, along with all sorts of things where actually the audience for them is very small.

155
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,520
I think the latter sort are fine.

156
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:52,160
You know, you may only get 10 people tuning in, but those people really care and they're all over the world.

157
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,560
So I think there is something there about you can do certain sorts of things better in small groups, including an internet presence.

158
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:15,340
And if you just said, well, we won't be doing all of it, but we're going to focus on, say, half a dozen really high profile events that we'll do online and a few small and very specialist events that we'll do online.

159
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,980
And the rest of the stuff will happen if it happens and not if it doesn't.

160
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,620
I think that's very true.

161
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:27,560
And actually, I spent two days this week doing two full day training calls, which all took place on Zoom.

162
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,500
And it was incredibly tiring.

163
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,680
And I would never voluntarily do that for an Easter con.

164
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,020
So you don't need to stream 420 items.

165
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,880
You need to stream 20.

166
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,140
Maximum, yeah.

167
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:45,720
Because I think if I was going to do that, I would be streaming the big Guests of Honor panels and talks.

168
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,040
Because oftentimes what happens is I'm torn between an interesting little niche item and the interview with John Scalzi.

169
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:02,320
And if you stream the interview with John Scalzi, John Scalzi is already going to be on his best behavior because he is in that kind of work mode as a Guests of Honor anyway.

170
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,620
And it means I can go to a small little niche panel that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to attend.

171
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:14,440
So I do think there is an argument there that you can get around that by only streaming the big panels where you're already hedging your bets a bit.

172
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:22,780
The other thing I will say is that I think that at the moment we have panels that are more intimate because we know they're not being recorded.

173
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:31,220
And I think if you start recording panels, you will get a slight shift in what people are willing to say if they know they're being recorded, which I think would change the complexion of panels slightly.

174
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:39,080
It is interesting to note, I think I saw one of the people who worked on Con Zealand saying that prior to the announcement they were going virtual,

175
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,920
only five people who had filled out the program survey had said that they did not want to be recorded.

176
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,360
So I think most people appearing on panels are willing to be recorded.

177
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,800
I think as long as they know it's going to happen in advance and can tailor their presence on that panel with that knowledge.

178
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,220
I do think in some ways you'd lose a lot if you streamed the entire program, but I wouldn't necessarily think that would be necessary.

179
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,520
Although I will say if it was only available to supporting and attending members,

180
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:15,040
I think I wonder to what extent I would be worried about guarding my speech because if I know that anyone at the Eastercon can watch my speech back,

181
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,100
that's not much more public than anyone at the Eastercon being able to come into my panel.

182
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,880
But I don't know.

183
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,740
Anybody at the Eastercon who has recording technology can then pass it on.

184
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,540
In practice, everyone can record all the time anyway.

185
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,260
You know, we've not really...

186
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,320
People are very polite about asking if they can record panels.

187
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,360
But anyone with a phone can record a panel.

188
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,260
So we don't really...

189
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:48,620
We've not really been able to have the sort of freedom to have the late night drunken panels that were once a feature of conventions.

190
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,760
That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I do miss them sometimes.

191
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,080
Well, you do still get a couple, but I must admit I always prefer going to parties than panels,

192
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,340
but I want to have a drunken laugh.

193
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,960
So the last time we were at the Birmingham Hilton, I went to a late night panel on,

194
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,900
I think, administering the Hugo Awards, which sounded like an incredibly dry panel,

195
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,340
but was actually a really great one.

196
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,000
So sometimes the unexpected panels are the surprisingly great,

197
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,960
slightly...

198
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,100
All the audience are drinking late night panels.

199
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,280
That's a good point.

200
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,180
And certain panel concepts like vote with your arse would work very well as a drunken late night thing.

201
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,500
Although you'd have to be quite careful not for it to become a contact support, I think.

202
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,700
You may have to explain vote with your arse, John.

203
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:45,480
You have a room in which there is either sort of a one-dimensional line or a circle of chairs,

204
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,420
and the moderator of the panel will pose questions to the audience,

205
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,280
and the audience will divide themselves in the room according to their opinion on that question.

206
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,060
So oftentimes it'll be like, which is better, the 10th or 11th doctor?

207
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,740
And everyone who thinks the 10th doctor is best stands on the left,

208
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,360
and then everyone who thinks the 11th doctor is best stands on the right.

209
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,520
Where do you put the people who can't remember which is which?

210
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,260
It's a good panel item for a light-hearted kind of group argument format,

211
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,260
which can be very fun, especially if everyone has had a drink.

212
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,300
So as a late night panel idea, it could work quite well.

213
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,920
The people who think the 4th doctor was best just rattle their Zimmer frames.

214
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:31,280
Another bid that was mooted at the bid session was the 2022 bid led by Phil Dyson,

215
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,640
who has COVID-19 at the point he was presenting the bid, which is truly heroic.

216
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,920
He still did a pretty good job, I have to say.

217
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,320
He did an excellent job.

218
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,140
I think for somebody who was plague-ridden, he really did step up to the plate and give a good bid.

219
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,780
I think he probably did better than I would do remotely without the plague, so...

220
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,020
He smashed it out of the park.

221
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,580
I've got a lot of time for Phil.

222
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,820
I think he's an excellent com-runner, and I think his bid was very well put together.

223
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,240
There was a kind of take-the-temperature-of-the-room vote

224
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
for whether or not people thought what he had announced was fair,

225
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,300
but he did not put his bid forward for an actual confirmation vote

226
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,900
because they do not yet have a venue.

227
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,000
They are still in discussion with a few different places as to where they're going to end up.

228
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,200
And I think they heavily hinted that they were trying to end up in the north of England somewhere.

229
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,420
Are you excited about the 2022 Eastercon from what you heard at the bid session?

230
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,740
It's actually much easier to bid an Eastercon if you're not doing the whole package.

231
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,440
So if you don't have your whole committee together, if you don't have a site to announce,

232
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,020
if you don't have anything for people to really say,

233
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,860
well, actually, we hate some of this idea.

234
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,120
So obviously it's very positive, but that's because it's not a complete bid yet.

235
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm still very excited about the idea of going to an Eastercon and meeting my friends.

236
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,120
You have no idea.

237
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
I'm very excited about the idea of going to the pub.

238
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,940
I'm actually quite excited about the idea of going to the shops, you know,

239
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,780
not to buy essential items, but just to kind of hang around an Apple store for an afternoon.

240
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,660
You know, I might...

241
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:17,200
What excites me has really gone downhill at this point.

242
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,100
You heard it here first, folks.

243
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,920
And to, like, stop at those pretzel stands where they give you a bit of pretzel to taste,

244
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,780
with germs, no doubt.

245
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,720
All of these things.

246
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,060
I'm just very excited by anything other than sitting in rooms.

247
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,320
Liz, how excited are you by bits of pretzel and going to Apple stores?

248
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,780
Those are not two things which are really high on my list, to be honest.

249
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,640
I'm quite excited by the idea of having an Eastercon in 2022.

250
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,200
I think Phil's going to do a great job.

251
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,460
And I look forward to seeing the rest of Phil's team and his guests and also location.

252
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:02,520
I think it's also worth noting that we really don't know what the hotel market is going to look like in 2022

253
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,020
and what will be available.

254
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,780
And it might completely have changed.

255
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:13,640
There might be far fewer in-person gatherings and prices could change and hotel chains could completely fold.

256
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,840
So it's going to be a fun year for Phil sorting that one out.

257
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,540
I think we may have a significantly smaller Eastercon or a significantly bigger one.

258
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:30,840
I think one of the things we do know is that it takes a lot for hotels to actually close.

259
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:39,840
They just, they kind of go down market and shabbier and shabbier and shabbier when times are hard until they end up as the Adelphi.

260
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:48,780
And it seems likely that when we do decide we want to get together again, we will find somewhere we can do that.

261
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:55,320
I think going a bit down market and shabby is really our target set of hotels.

262
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,040
Okay.

263
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:03,500
So one of the reasons that EasterCons are hard at the moment is that shabby hotels tend to be quite bad for access

264
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,800
and we have increasingly complex access needs.

265
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,380
That's, I think, a big part of the problem.

266
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,500
I mean, the Adelphi, I still love it, but it is a nightmare of stairs as well as being a nightmare of a hotel to work with.

267
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:24,780
We had a stair problem at the Majestic that I think that they've looked at again for 2022 and concluded is not ever going to be soluble.

268
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:31,040
I think that's a problem with a lot of the shabby sites that if you're shabby, you don't sort out these access problems.

269
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:39,260
And although we talk about fans liking slightly shabby spaces, as we've grown older, we've kind of liked our creature comforts as well.

270
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,320
So in fact, we don't really like shabby hotels any more than anybody else does.

271
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,640
So what we're actually hoping for is hotels with great access to become shabby.

272
00:23:50,020 --> 00:24:02,420
I think it will be interesting to see if some of the high-end conferences do go virtual, whether there is scope to use the sorts of hotels that are just completely out of our league at the moment that do exist.

273
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,760
Yeah, that's fair. It will be interesting to see how that happens, I think.

274
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:17,640
Over East Weekend, there were a plethora, a myriad, a very simple smorgasbord of virtual activities arranged by a host of good people, including our very own Alice and Scott.

275
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,520
So what virtual pursuits did you go to?

276
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,620
I think we mentioned a lot of them on the podcast, but what did you go to and what worked and what didn't?

277
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,380
I didn't go to any of the programme, but I did go to a party every single night.

278
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,960
So it was a lot like a real Eastercom for me.

279
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,100
I did go to the bidding session, but apart from that, I didn't get to any programme.

280
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,220
I don't think there was any programme, actually. I think that's the problem.

281
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:53,220
And I discovered that drinking a very large amount of beer in the vicinity of my extremely expensive work computer is probably a terrible mistake.

282
00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:02,840
And I may need some kind of beer ingestion system that doesn't involve leaving open cans of beer on my desk in future.

283
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,940
You need one of those hats with the two cans of beers in the store.

284
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:13,460
For example, I'm not sure how that would go with the whole headphones and microphone and pop filter.

285
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,580
No, this is a new market. Headphones with built-in beer holders.

286
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:24,040
Yes, we have invented a thing. Well, we have the idea for an invention. We will patent it.

287
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:31,600
And Octothorpe will be forever remembered as the inventor of the Podcaster Beer-o-matic 3000.

288
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,340
I also went to parties. I don't think I went to as many parties as you.

289
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,160
Did you go to the Dead Dog? I didn't find out about the Dead Dog until afterwards.

290
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,620
I did go to the Dead Dog because I did find out about it.

291
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:51,560
But one of the things I established when I set my party up was that you have to be quite assiduous in telling people that events are on in Facebook.

292
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,220
I got to the point where I was worried that Facebook were going to concern the police around.

293
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:02,700
Because every time I went into my Facebook event for my party, it flashed up increasingly strident warnings saying,

294
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,900
you're not supposed to be gathering. You should not be having events of many people.

295
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,040
And there didn't seem to be a box to tick to say, it's on Zoom, you idiots.

296
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,600
I kind of publicised my party very hard, much more than I ever would a real party,

297
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,660
where essentially you have to be chatting to me and then I give you party invitation.

298
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:28,220
But I kind of told everyone repeatedly about it, including people who were not on Facebook.

299
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:36,280
And I think other people who ran parties rather relied on Facebook to show the party invite to their friends.

300
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,940
And Facebook's terrible at that.

301
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,980
So I think a lot of people didn't know about it.

302
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,420
But there were parties every night, I think.

303
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,720
And some nights have more than one party.

304
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,360
Yes.

305
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,860
I thoroughly enjoyed your room party.

306
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,680
Or sorry, your Zoom party.

307
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,020
I start, we started the party at nine.

308
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,740
I had some beer that I had bought from the pub across the bridge from me,

309
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,720
which I believe I was talking about at the live recording.

310
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,700
And then I had some beer.

311
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,860
And then I had some more beer.

312
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,800
And then I had some gin.

313
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,820
And then I had some more gin.

314
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,240
And at midnight, I ordered pizza and ate some pizza.

315
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,940
And I went to bed at 3am.

316
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,760
And then I woke up the next morning with a stonking hangover and no hotel breakfast.

317
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,520
So it was almost exactly like a real Saturday night at an Easter con.

318
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,480
And I thoroughly enjoyed it.

319
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,340
It really took all of the sadness out of my weekend.

320
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,700
It was absolutely fantastic.

321
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,740
So thank you very much for organising it.

322
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,600
It was great.

323
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,880
That's very kind.

324
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,220
That was what I was hoping for.

325
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,820
I was hoping that people would drink too much and stay up too late and have hangovers.

326
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,640
There is a slight problem with Zoom parties,

327
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,680
which is it turns out that if you drink too much and stay up too late,

328
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,220
then gradually people from Australia and New Zealand,

329
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,080
and indeed Thailand, start to join your party.

330
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,220
And these parties could theoretically just kind of continue on

331
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,800
in a never-ending cycle of debauchery through this method.

332
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,540
Though I think eventually Zoom throws you out going,

333
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,760
you lot are a load of dirty stopouts.

334
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,100
Ain't you got homes to go to?

335
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,280
But then you could just start Zoom again.

336
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,720
So it's not too bad.

337
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,500
So basically you're saying that Zoom is going to recreate,

338
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,760
was it the longest party anyone ever had that flies around in the Hitchhiker's Guide?

339
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,860
Yes.

340
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,420
Randomly attacking places for party supplies?

341
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,140
You're basically going to recreate that.

342
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,680
I had a great time.

343
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,180
I was reminded of, I think it was a few years ago, John,

344
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,900
when you decided to stay up all night drinking at an Easter con,

345
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,240
and then we had breakfast together the next morning,

346
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,960
while you were extremely kind of passing from very drunk into slightly hungover,

347
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,360
and the hangover was going to appear.

348
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,880
And I was like, just woken up and having breakfast.

349
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,640
And I very, I definitely recreated that experience at Alison's party.

350
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,980
But it was fun, because if it was a party actually at an Easter con,

351
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,220
then I would not have been able to go.

352
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,880
Was that, that must be 2008, maybe?

353
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,600
No, it was at the Park Inn, so it must be...

354
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,520
Oh, okay.

355
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,560
No, I do remember.

356
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,740
Well, we had breakfast with Seanan McGuire, who was the guest of honour,

357
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,740
because she turned up in the bar,

358
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,600
and me and Alison and Claire and Jerry,

359
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,240
and a couple of other people who I don't remember,

360
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,000
had been staying up drinking at about 6am,

361
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,520
and Seanan came down and asked,

362
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,320
please tell me that you have got up early and you're not here from the night before.

363
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,360
We said, we got up early.

364
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,600
She said, that's a lie, isn't it?

365
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,280
We said, yes.

366
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,340
And then she sighed, and we eventually had breakfast.

367
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,560
But that might not have been the same type.

368
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,940
The problem with all of these stories is I was very drunk,

369
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,920
so my memories are hazy.

370
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:47,440
The Park Inn is a remarkable hotel, because it's at Heathrow.

371
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,440
It is possible to get caffeinated beverages

372
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,160
made with actual coffee machines 24 hours a day

373
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,960
without any difficulty at all.

374
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,760
So at that point, at about 3 in the morning,

375
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,440
where you go, you know, unless I have a double espresso,

376
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,040
I'm probably going to need to go to bed soon.

377
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,620
You can have a double espresso and carry on.

378
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,080
It is pretty fantastic.

379
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,020
Was that the one you were thinking of, Liz, or was it a different one?

380
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,400
I think it was that one, but I think what happened is you had like three or four

381
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,680
different separate breakfasts.

382
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,480
I think you had that breakfast at like 6am.

383
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,120
Then you went for a nap, and then you got to have breakfast again about 10 o'clock.

384
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,360
I mean, I'm not saying I'm a hero, but I'm heavily implying it.

385
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,300
I remember that.

386
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,920
That is possibly the most fun I have ever had at an Eastercon.

387
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,240
I've got to the stage in my life that every time I stay up all night drinking,

388
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,260
I think, is this the last time I will ever stay up all night drinking?

389
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,580
Oh!

390
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,420
And it never is, or it never has been so far.

391
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,360
Wait!

392
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,000
Well, that is a result, I think.

393
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,580
And it was good because later on we were talking about it, and you arrived at about 2am UK time,

394
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,500
and by that time I was half a pizza and many beers down.

395
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,280
And it was very good to see you.

396
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,620
I very hazily remember that that happened, and yes.

397
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,420
But it was properly, it did properly feel like an Eastercon.

398
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,700
It was truly excellent.

399
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,140
In other news, things that have happened since last time we recorded,

400
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,860
one of us needs congratulating.

401
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,180
Congratulations to Alison Scott for being this year's Guff winner.

402
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,820
Yes, I'm very pleased.

403
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,260
And I am quite pleased that it wasn't close, that lots of people voted,

404
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,740
and lots of them voted for me, and I do appreciate that.

405
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,980
That is lovely.

406
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:45,980
I've been a bit worried because I ran because one of my nominators kind of twisted my arm up my back

407
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,740
and said, you should really run in this race.

408
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,140
And that was because I was worried that there wouldn't be candidates,

409
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,900
and then there ended up being six.

410
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,960
So I was like...

411
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,960
And then there's a whole lot of complexity around this,

412
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,800
because given my...

413
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,100
This is the first Guff race since my youngest child turned 18,

414
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,760
And given my druthers, I wouldn't have chosen to go to a Worldcon in Australia and New Zealand.

415
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,860
I'd have chosen to go to a national convention,

416
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,500
because Worldcons are kind of more the same anywhere,

417
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,740
whereas if you go to a national convention or a large regional,

418
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,440
you really get to meet fans in the area doing fan-ish things.

419
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,980
But because of various personal crap that's going on in my life,

420
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,320
I wasn't sure I would be able to run in a couple of years or three years or whatever.

421
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,140
So I am now committed to virtually attending Cods Eland,

422
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,820
which I'm very much looking forward to.

423
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,060
And I'm going to talk a little bit about how I'm going to do that in a second.

424
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,500
But also, I will make a real trip to Australia and New Zealand,

425
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,360
hopefully next year.

426
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,440
I mean, I'm not going to go until it feels like it's safe to go.

427
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,820
So that might end up being...

428
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,080
I mean, I hope it'll be next year, but it might be 2022.

429
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,160
You know, but I'll go when I can.

430
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,160
And I'm really excited to have won.

431
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,140
And thank you everyone very much for voting for me

432
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,140
and putting your faith in me as a fan fund delegate.

433
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,520
And it's particularly sweet,

434
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,700
because I really don't think I was ever going to be able to afford to travel

435
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,860
without the fan funds.

436
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,480
So I'm really very thrilled.

437
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,720
I am planning a virtual trip.

438
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,280
So what I'm going to do is I was going to go for three weeks,

439
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,320
ending two weeks in Australia and a week in New Zealand,

440
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,920
plus travel, ending at the New Zealand Worldcon.

441
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,880
So I'd have had the Worldcon and then one rest day and then flying home.

442
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,980
And so I'm going to take that exact period of time.

443
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,180
And if you are any part of any Australian or New Zealand

444
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:49,600
or somewhere who can reasonably visit it on the way as a stopover fan group,

445
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,860
I would like to have a virtual meeting in your area.

446
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,980
And I'd also like to do the virtual tourist attractions in those areas

447
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,900
in the period leading up to New Zealand.

448
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,420
So I'm hoping to meet with as many fan groups as possible

449
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,760
and as many fans as possible

450
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,120
and do as many of the experiences virtually

451
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,160
that I would actually have been able to do if I'd visited.

452
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,320
So that's that's kind of the plan.

453
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,460
Excellent stuff.

454
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,140
I'm going to go on to Australia and New Zealand time.

455
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,680
One of those.

456
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,920
I assume they are not all in the same time zone as it's an area about as big as

457
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,880
Europe or maybe even a bit bigger.

458
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,180
So I don't know.

459
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,240
But I will I will do I will be on their time zones as well for three weeks,

460
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,120
which is kind of night shift.

461
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,440
According to time and date dot com,

462
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,480
there are eight total time zones in Australia and New Zealand.

463
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,980
And is one of them a half hour time zone?

464
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,780
Yes, there's a half hour time zone.

465
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,040
Yes, Adelaide.

466
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,200
So you can you can really go go off Pieston and set yourself,

467
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,160
you know, ten and a half hours away.

468
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,500
There's a quarter hour time zone.

469
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,440
There's a quarter hour time zone, Alison.

470
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,640
You must go there.

471
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,840
On my taff trip, I went to St.

472
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,200
John's in Newfoundland on my way to Toronto.

473
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,060
And that is a half hour time zone.

474
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,960
And I got very excited because that's a cool thing to do.

475
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,700
NB may not actually be cool, maybe heavily dependent on nerdery.

476
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,000
But yes, there is a part of Australia which is a quarter hour time zone.

477
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,800
And I don't know if there is any fandom there.

478
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,780
So there are eight time zones in Australia and New Zealand.

479
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,240
And my challenge for my virtual trip is to visit all of them.

480
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,160
I will have the worst case of jet lag.

481
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,440
I think I'm going to aim for the worst case of jet lag ever without leaving your own home.

482
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,400
Excellent.

483
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,720
I'm not sure there are eight time zones.

484
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,320
I think they span eight hours, technically.

485
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,620
Ah, maybe.

486
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,380
But we might be too fine to time zone nerdery now.

487
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:51,260
Australians and New Zealanders, please send us letters of comment about why we are wrong about your time zones.

488
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,260
So send those two, Alice and Dot Scott.

489
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,620
No.

490
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:06,140
I confidently predict that somewhere in our very small listenership, there will be someone who is nerdy about time zones than we can believe possible.

491
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,760
And they will be in touch.

492
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,560
Excellent.

493
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,680
Please.

494
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,260
For people who have not looked at the voting statistics, there were six candidates for Gov.

495
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,700
One of the candidates dropped out and the other five were comprised of individuals and couples.

496
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,580
So it's like six groups of people, I suppose, rather than six individuals.

497
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,240
But Alison won with over 50% of the first preference votes.

498
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,720
And when will you write your trip report, Alison?

499
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,620
Well, I'm going to write a virtual trip report this year, but I'll do a real one as well.

500
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,260
You're not going to get my trip report for a while, are you?

501
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,500
I'll have to think of a more of another new format to do it in.

502
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,360
Maybe it'll be the first Zoom, Zoom.

503
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,820
No, it'll be the second Zoom trip report, won't it?

504
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:53,760
Me and Anna Raftery have been doing Zoom videos in order to do Anna's TAF report.

505
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,560
So Anna went to Mid-America on two in 2016, which was in Kansas City.

506
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,900
And she was the TAF winner.

507
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,880
And so I interviewed Anna on Friday, as we record, that was two days ago,

508
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,800
talking about the first leg of her trip and her reasons for running for TAF

509
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,520
and how she found the experience of running.

510
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,720
And I think that went really well.

511
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,400
We had about 20 listeners live and the video, audio and transcript thereof

512
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,580
will be made available for a small donation to the fan funds

513
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,320
when we've done the whole trip in conversational form.

514
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,600
I wanted to explore what the format of a trip report could be

515
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,080
because obviously the original trip reports came out of Fanzine fandom

516
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,900
in the early to mid-50s.

517
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,900
As the fan funds have gone on for longer and longer,

518
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,960
they have become less and less tied specifically to Fanzine fandom

519
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,280
and have become a much broader thing that reflects a lot more corners of our fandom,

520
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,740
which I think is really good.

521
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,780
But one of the flip sides of that is that not everyone who wins necessarily

522
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:59,380
has the skills to write, edit and produce a 80 to 100 page document.

523
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,280
So I think some people are, you know, much more conversational or have different skill sets.

524
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,620
And so I wanted to do something with Anna because I thought she would be very good

525
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,900
in a kind of more conversational video, audio medium.

526
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,160
And I think it went really well.

527
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,100
I hope it went really well.

528
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,840
I found it interesting, but I was obviously the interviewer.

529
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,160
And Liz could not attend because we held it in the evening,

530
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,980
which was about three in the morning for Liz.

531
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,760
But Alison very helpfully let us host it on her Zoom

532
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,360
and sort of did introductions.

533
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,040
And then we had a bit of a party afterwards.

534
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,000
So that was also very good.

535
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,440
I think I am learning that when you're doing something like this,

536
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,000
formally using Zoom or another video conferencing solution,

537
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,120
it's extremely helpful to have one person whose job is only managing people in the room

538
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,860
and letting them know what's going on and telling them how to do things and all of that stuff.

539
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,200
Because if you're trying to do that, plus also run the interview,

540
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,760
if you're me, you'll get distracted all of the time.

541
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,900
And because I don't have webinar mode, because it's an extra 40 quid a month,

542
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,560
we're doing this thing where whenever anyone turns up,

543
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,580
we have to quickly turn their video off so that it doesn't appear on the eventual recording.

544
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,140
But hopefully that will all come out in John's beautiful edit.

545
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:22,180
I think you'll find video editing is much more complicated than podcast editing, maybe?

546
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:27,480
The videos, I think, will probably be less highly edited than the audio.

547
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,860
So my plan with the videos is basically just to cut out moments where it was someone else's camera coming up

548
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,160
because they were joined and we hadn't managed to blank them out yet.

549
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,980
With the audio, I will go through and kind of cut out the ums and errs,

550
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,140
and that will be available as a kind of audiobook.

551
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:55,580
And then I will do transcripts of that on top, which Claire Briarley is assisting with in her capacity as person who does lots of work for very little thanks,

552
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,840
which is a thing that she is very good at.

553
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,560
And I try and make sure that I say her name and give her thanks wherever possible in order to address that balance.

554
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:10,420
I think it is good for the fan funds to move with the times a bit.

555
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:17,560
I think it is good not to exclude them from being fan fund candidates if their attitude is not for producing a giant written report,

556
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:25,500
but for doing something in audio form or video form or photography or whatever medium they would like to report in, basically.

557
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,700
And I think you've got everything covered.

558
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,020
You're going to do it by video and audio.

559
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:35,860
And unfortunately, not everyone will be able to watch live, but there will be recordings and there will be transcripts.

560
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,980
So you've got all the bases covered.

561
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:45,280
Yeah, we are, I think, also going to try to do it at different times to make sure that different recordings can have people from different time zones.

562
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,760
But I think I suspect most of them will be at times that US people can turn up because obviously,

563
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,800
TAF is most interesting to Europeans and people in North America.

564
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:04,200
And so obviously tailoring the time zones to the evening in Europe means that you hit that better.

565
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:16,440
But I think we'll try and do at least one that is suitable for people who are in time zones ahead of London in order to make sure that they can have at least one experience of coming along.

566
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,960
Just for you, Liz, and also for other people who live in far off places.

567
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:28,840
Yeah, I realise I have brought this upon myself by moving to a time zone which is either six or seven hours ahead of the UK.

568
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:34,640
But yeah, you are not the first people to have to grapple with the problems of time zones and virtual events and you will not be the last.

569
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
We will not.

570
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:42,980
And I suspect we will come on to discussing that a bit more when we touch upon Con Zealand in the next episode.

571
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,540
Do either of you have anything else you'd like to say about the fan funds?

572
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:52,120
I think this is probably a good point for you to mention your trip report, your imminent trip report, John.

573
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,440
So I have written a trip report.

574
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,460
It is 90 pages long and somewhere in the region of 25,000 words.

575
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,000
And it is very almost finished.

576
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,240
It only needs two more pieces of art.

577
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:11,160
And one of them is being constructed by a Alison Scott of Walthamstone.

578
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,720
So if Alison, if you could sort of get your finger out a little bit, then I can get my trip report out.

579
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,700
OK, so there's a slight catch, which is that this weekend, a lot of the time that I might have done that has been doing things like

580
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,300
helping with Anna's taff thing and recording Octothorpe.

581
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:42,040
And in fact, I've had I had I've had four kind of very work like Zoom events where I've been responsible for managing the structure of the event this weekend,

582
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,140
which seems like more than you should have to have in.

583
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:53,840
I feel like I've discovered a new skill that's apparently a paying job skill in this new world,

584
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,500
except that I don't really want to do it for pay because I was very happy selling crap on the Internet.

585
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,400
So, you know, anyway.

586
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,980
So, yes.

587
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,720
So I'm sorry.

588
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,440
I will get my finger out, but possibly still not this weekend.

589
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,920
So, you know, soon, soon, soon, soon.

590
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,680
Real soon now.

591
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,000
As you've missed the Eastcon deadline, you don't really need to get it out before Con Zealand, do you?

592
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,820
My new plan is probably to do it next year because next year will be the 10th anniversary.

593
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,600
And that seems like if I'm going to do it late, I might as well do it properly late.

594
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,960
But Anna's report.

595
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,340
So for those who don't know, who aren't as read up on the website,

596
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,760
various plan funds as I am, having been an administrator,

597
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,100
there are bounties available for submitting trip reports.

598
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:41,020
There is a bounty from an American organisation,

599
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,320
and there is a bounty from a Canadian organisation.

600
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,540
And when I have remembered their names, I will put links in the show notes.

601
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,080
The Canadian one has a five-year deadline and the American one has no deadline.

602
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,880
So I will get the American one, which is $500, and that will be $500 for TAF.

603
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,980
The benefit of doing Anna's this year is that as long as we get it finished by the end of the year,

604
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,920
she will come under the deadline for the Canadian bounty as well.

605
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,560
So that will be $8,000, I believe, for TAF.

606
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,420
Is that five years from the date of trip or five years from winning the fund?

607
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,280
This seems more relevant than it might be.

608
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,100
It would be as long as we do it by the end of 2020.

609
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,440
They are the same.

610
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,000
Both of those will be true.

611
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,520
I actually don't know.

612
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,260
I assume it's from the date of the trip.

613
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,820
Yeah, I'm just slightly worried about this for my guff thing, though.

614
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,060
Projects that are left do fester.

615
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:34,000
So I kind of think I'm going to have to do it within a year of actually making the trip

616
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,460
or all of those things that you remember I will have forgotten.

617
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,700
When I do the proper trip, I am going to take a lot of recording devices with me.

618
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:50,200
I'm going to try and make notes and scribble things onto Facebook and so on every single day.

619
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,620
Otherwise, yeah, you know what it's like.

620
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:58,780
The words in my trip report were mostly committed to fanzines within the month after I came back.

621
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:03,520
And it is only the kind of written and nicely formatted trip report that has taken ages.

622
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,780
I wrote all of the words as I was going along.

623
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,180
And editing, it turns out, is effort.

624
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,800
I was planning to ask Claire to do it.

625
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,360
Claire did a proofread run on mine, which took me about three days to go through

626
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,900
because it was 500 comments on 25,000 words.

627
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,380
OK, I can beat that.

628
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,320
I did a poster.

629
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,920
I did a poster for Dublin.

630
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,880
It was a big poster to go on the wall.

631
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,220
Caroline gave me the words.

632
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,080
I did the layout.

633
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:35,100
I just happened to give it to Claire to proofread at a party.

634
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,520
And I think there were 500 comments on that.

635
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,080
And it was one poster.

636
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,620
Claire is a proofreading machine.

637
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,140
If you ever need Earthy proofread, Claire is a good person to proofread it.

638
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,640
I actually think she should probably at some point start charging for her services because

639
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,300
she's very good.

640
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,620
And also, some of the comments made me laugh and I'm a bit sad no one else will ever get

641
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,200
to read them.

642
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,540
You could definitely put an appendix to your trip report that is the funniest bits out of

643
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,180
the proofread.

644
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:07,320
There are footnotes in my trip report, which are the thing that Claire said about that thing.

645
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,020
And I just put that in a footnote.

646
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,480
How are we all feeling about staying sane in the apocalypse?

647
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,340
I have to say I'm feeling several degrees less sane than I was a couple of weeks ago.

648
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:24,140
If this were Call of Cthulhu or Arkham Horror or something, my insanity would be rising or

649
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,040
my sanity would be dropping precipitously.

650
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,740
So actually, that's funny you say that because one of the ways me and Liz have been staying

651
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,540
sane in the apocalypse is playing Arkham Horror over Tate Drop Simulator, sort of simulating

652
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,880
our lapsing sanity in order to prevent it happening in real life.

653
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,080
But I must admit, I do, I can feel my sanity slipping slightly.

654
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,780
I think I am getting less productive and slightly more frustrated to be indoors.

655
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,300
I bought a new portable telephone.

656
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,480
Oh, what portable telephone is it?

657
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,920
It is an iPhone SE.

658
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:04,020
So it's exactly like my old iPhone SE, except bigger and much flashier and very much faster.

659
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:10,180
And I'm not quite used to it yet because it feels very big and flashy and it's slightly

660
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:15,600
too big for my hands, which is the reason why I didn't have a phone in that form factor before.

661
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,240
Phones have got too big for me.

662
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,340
I might have to go back to one of those little Nokia things.

663
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,920
And then I realised that it was stupid buying a phone because I'm not going out anywhere or

664
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,980
seeing anyone or doing any of the sorts of things for which it's quite handy to have a phone on you.

665
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,040
Are either of you finding that you are turning to retail therapy to stay safe?

666
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,900
Because I'm definitely, I'm spending less money because I'm obviously trapped in my house.

667
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,700
But I'm definitely buying more stuff than I was.

668
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,600
Well, I've said two things.

669
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,540
I've said, first of all, that my mother always told me to save for a rainy day.

670
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,700
And this day seems to be pretty rainy as days go.

671
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:57,540
So my habit of buying nothing in my life has turned into a buy everything in my life.

672
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:05,100
So, for example, during this podcast, I have bought a clamp on microphone stand for a blue snowball

673
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,480
microphone from eBay.

674
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:16,760
So that next time we speak, I will actually be able to have the snowball right in front of my face.

675
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,400
Liz, how are you staying sane?

676
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,900
And what's the COVID-19 situation like in Thailand?

677
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,560
Are you allowed out or are you under curfew?

678
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,560
What are the restrictions you're under?

679
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,480
I can't go out between 10pm and 4am, which is fine because all the restaurants and pubs are shut anyway.

680
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,760
So you're not going out drinking.

681
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,000
You also can't currently buy alcohol.

682
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,480
But fortunately, I laid in a stockpile of gin.

683
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,620
I'm doing OK.

684
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,440
It turns out I'm quite well suited to sitting in the house all day and not talking to anyone.

685
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,100
But I have just got a very exciting message saying that people are coming around to deliver cookies to me.

686
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,300
This is not a joke.

687
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,540
So I will have to leave the podcast shortly in order to go and collect cookies.

688
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,200
Is that OK?

689
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,300
That is OK.

690
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,000
We can use that as our impetus to wrap up.

691
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:02,540
So from the three of us, thank you very much for listening to the Octothorpe Podcast.

692
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,780
And it's goodbye from me.

693
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,400
And it's goodbye from me.

694
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,740
And it's goodbye from me.

695
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:14,000

Excellent.

698
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,120
Well, we will speak to you soon, Liz.

699
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,180
I hope the cookies are lovely.

700
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,820
Please send me a picture of them so I can put it in the show notes.
