00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 I have to tell Jerry that we've recorded this now so that she needs to get a finger out and get idea finished.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:25,360
 Hello everyone and welcome to a very special bonus episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,680
 Crassong and other pastries. I'm John Coxon, I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,320
 Wait, so quite some today?

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,240
 Yes, so when I decided to start writing my guff report, I decided that most of the

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,800
 articles were going to be about kind of topics rather than, you know, I went here and I

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:52,160
 ate this and I ate that and I ate the other and so also when we had Sandra Bond on doing a very

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,240
 funny and excellent portion of her Taff report, I thought I know I could do a portion of my

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,480
 guff report live on Octothorpe, well not live, but on Octothorpe and that would be good and it

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,840
 would make sense to be the one about Quaslon because obviously I eat a lot of almond quaslon

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,800
 and I eat a lot of almond quaslon on Octothorpe but not today because today we're recording on a

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,760
 Saturday rather than a Sunday so I ate at McDonald's instead but hey that's probably off topic already.

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,240
 So this might get a better title for the printed report but at the moment it is called

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,120
 Quaslon Engineering, shall I just get going? You guys should interrupt or laugh or whatever

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,840
 because otherwise I'm going to be very worried by the end of my...

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:46,400
 It's going to be like, you know, have your tumbleweed react ready. I'm really not a very picky person.

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,960
 Was that an intentional joke because it was very funny. Yes! Oh good!

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,200
 Except as it happens in the matter of coffee shop, I have to have nice coffee obviously and

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,880
 somewhere comfortable sit down. Ideally that spot should be at a table, big enough to set a tablet

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,080
 and keyboard on and reasonably close to a pass socket and definitely not a barstools. I'm not

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,840
 great with barstools on account of having to climb up them. I'm not at all fussy about the

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,120
 internet access that my coffee shop either free Wi-Fi or fast mobile collection will do and they

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
 need of course to serve a banging almond quassel. So it's a curious thing the almond quassel. What

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,840
 other peak of human achievement is best made from leftovers? Okay, bubble and squeak. But

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,000
 almond quassels were developed as a way to use up yesterday's quassel no longer saleable in their

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,760
 own right. At this point I have to draw a veil over my much-missed local Greg's Outlet Store,

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,960
 which sold dale croissants in their own right, but they were fine. Take a bunch of dale

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,640
 croissants, fill them with franger pan, you cover them with icing sugar and almond flakes,

29
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,600
 heat them up and nobody will ever know. And yet somehow this has been extrapolated to a work of art,

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,680
 the sugar and the heat provide just the right degree of caramelisation. There are so many moving

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
 parts, there must be a thousand different ways to make one. In my case I'm after something that

32
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
 is anxiously perfect in all respects with just the right balance of franger pan,

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,680
 quassel and sugar and almond. And by right, of course, I mean to my taste, because what

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
 other right could there possibly be? And of course in the manner of the connoisseur,

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,640
 CXKCD915, I am almost invariably disappointed. This one is too dry, that one is too soggy,

36
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,480
 that one has come from the supermarket and no they're never really good, not even the premium ones.

37
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,760
 They can be a dale, but not packed with nitrogen and stuffed with preservatives. This one is

38
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,880
 vegan, sorry vegans, but the texture of vegan quassels is too crispy for me. These ones have

39
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,120
 been made with a single bacon, not a double one, this one doesn't have enough franger pan,

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
 this one has too much and this other one has incorrectly distributed it so one end is

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,440
 unctuous and the other end is empty. Despite this trail of continuous disappointment,

42
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,000
 I order quite a few other quassels as such for the perfect one, I am hampered in this endeavour.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,080
 By all insisting on always pronouncing the thing, as I have been doing throughout this

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,840
 segment, Armand Quasse, who is coincidentally also the hero of my epic fantasy novel.

45
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,520
 That's a kind of written joke that will work better in the written version of the article.

46
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,240
 This does seem to be entirely the correct way to say it, but in many coffee shops I also have to

47
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,800
 put the object of my desire or change what I say to include all the letters I normally a bit,

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,400
 if I want to actually get an almond quassel, which I always do, Almond Quasselt.

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,080
 Armandquassels are not known for their health-giving properties and might even be considered a

50
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,880
 sometimes food, but the French eatquassels every day and universally the picture of elegance,

51
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,600
 they must be doing something right, even if that's just strong black coffee, unfiltered cigarettes

52
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,000
 and red wine. I realised this was billed as a chapter of my guff report and you might be wondering

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,640
 what any of this has to do with Australia. While I was oddly searching for interesting things to

54
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,880
 do in Melbourne, one of the things that came up was eat one of the world's best Armandquassel.

55
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,200
 Loon is a croissantery set up by a former Formula One racing car engineer.

56
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,800
 In one of those great origin stories Kate Reed was working at her dream job but finding it not

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
 all she'd hoped, so was baking a great many pastries to cheer herself up. Eventually she realised that

58
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,160
 what she needed was a pivot. I planned a pilgrimage. But Loon has several branches and we fortuitously

59
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,880
 passed one while touring the Central Business District with Jaddis Gellb on a cold rainy day.

60
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,040
 That allowed us to read a regular quest on but the Armandquassels had all gone for the day.

61
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,320
 At peak hours, i.e. before the Armandquassels run out, people queue around the block at Loon.

62
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,880
 It was then I learnt that Erwin Hirsch has a branch of Loon at the bottom of his block of flats.

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,680
 Erwin and Wendy had left their large family home for a new bill flat the previous year and were

64
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,640
 promised that that retail unit would have a cafe in it. Anticipating agreeable light lunches,

65
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,720
 they were non-plussed to discover it only solved coffee and up market quassels and such as soon

66
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,200
 as the latter sold out. Nevertheless, I pressed them to acquire quassels and we went round to see them.

67
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,280
 They were brought extra to take to the barbecue that Julian Warner and Lucy Sussex have put on

68
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,960
 our honor but also serve for us. And I finally got to try this world-class confection. It was

69
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,560
 exceptionally beautiful and as promised, very carefully engineered. The flaked arm and stuck

70
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,680
 up vertically like the swords of the iron throne. Most traditionally made Armandquassels a squished

71
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,400
 flat but this one retains its classic shape and it tasted very precise. It did balance the flavours

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,840
 very nicely and the French Japan was evenly spread throughout the croissant and not that sweet.

73
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,360
 Each bite was just as you would expect and act exactly as I'd say in principle that I desired.

74
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,480
 It looked perfect and it was delicious. You know that if you got another loon quassel it would be

75
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,320
 almost identical and just as nice. And I realised that my perfect Armandquassel would just be the

76
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,040
 tiniest bit soggier than the loon one and also just very slightly more random.

77
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,360
 I know what the title of this episode is now. What's the title of this episode John?

78
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,960
 Liz, do you know? No. Very slightly soggier.

79
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,640
 Okay. Also maybe the title of the article.

80
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,440
 We want you to make 12 identical pastries as they say on the Great British Bake Off

81
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,200
 but you could have too much identicalness. I want my Armandquassel distribution to have slightly more

82
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,680
 jiggle. No matter how many quassels I eat from Loon, they'll all everyone be in the uncanny

83
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,040
 valley of Armandquassel perfection. I have something to show you, declared Damien woman,

84
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,640
 after we returned from Womara to the House in Adelaide the following week.

85
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,600
 Thought you were about to show us something. But you're about to do like visual aids. No.

86
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,640
 No, I don't have anything to show you. No, there will be visual aids for this. I'll have a cover

87
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,800
 illustration for it and then maybe also a photograph of a loon Armandquassel. I have something to show

88
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,760
 you, declared Damien woman, after we returned from Womara to the House in Adelaide the following week.

89
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,720
 It turned out to be a fan scene, an art scene, not an SF scene, all about Armandquasselons.

90
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,320
 I was very excited about this because I thought I had found another connoisseur.

91
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,560
 I picked it up eagerly to learn about the author's take on the best faces to flying croissant,

92
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,000
 her identification of the characteristics of perfect croissant, and her experiences of eating

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,240
 them. But no, she merely likes Armandquassels and wants you to know that they're good.

94
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,720
 I should probably have been tipped off by the staples. It is true that I am almost as

95
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,880
 didactic about staples as I am about croissant, but I'd like to think that most people would

96
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,760
 struggle with these ones. They were stapled through the centrefold fanzine, a little way from the

97
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,680
 left margin. I'm so leaving a fold. Longarm staplers are not exactly rocket science, and I tell you,

98
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,200
 this method of fanzine production is shocked me. There we go. In general, Australian coffee is

99
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,360
 excellent, and don't they know it? And their coffee shops are generally pretty good, and their pastries

100
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,080
 are fine even when they're not a loon Armandquassel. People were very quick to tell me that I would

101
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,120
 find it hard to cope in New Zealand, where, according to Australians, the coffee bean is completely

102
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,920
 unknown. So as I travelled to New Zealand, I was excited to explore that country's take on my

103
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,480
 favourite pastry. But in practice, all thoughts of Armandquassel flew from my mind as I discovered

104
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,320
 that every coffee shop in the country, no matter how humble, serves cheese scones, mostly homemade.

105
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,800
 Luckily, I was not there long enough to establish a detailed ranking. I loved them all.

106
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,400
 So, staples. How do you feel about unstapled fanzines, Alison?

107
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,200
 I think they should. Well, I mean, I have no problem with unstapled fanzines

108
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,000
 when they are made out of a single sheet of paper.

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,560
 Oh dear, you're not of like to my fanzine.

110
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,800
 Oh, fine. I'm sure I don't like your fanzine. I just might have stapled it before reading it.

111
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,720
 That was what Mark used to do.

112
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
 Yeah, you know.

113
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
 He sent a lock.

114
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
 I have a long Armstapler, and I know how to use it.

115
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,240
 Did you find in general that the Almond-Crasants were better or worse than the UK?

116
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,680
 Like about the same, really. I'm in the same kind of range of really good ones to not like great ones.

117
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,840
 I mean, I didn't eat any supermarket ones, whereas in the UK, I do occasionally eat supermarket ones.

118
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,280
 I maybe shouldn't say it was that on the podcast, because the answer is

119
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,880
 "At the home of my friends when they serve us breakfast."

120
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,600
 My favourite Armstapler, of all, and this hasn't quite made it into the article are

121
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,880
 other ones from a pastry shop around the chocolateine, which was one of the things we didn't manage to last weekend,

122
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,920
 was go and get breakfast from chocolateine, because there were too many places to go and get breakfast from.

123
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680
 You were too busy going to get beer?

124
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,000
 Yeah, no, we also had beer and breakfast on Sunday.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,760
 Yeah, we went to a brewery called Blondys, and they open at 9am, and they have like a coffee bar,

126
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,960
 and they had pastries, and they had an almond croissant, which I actually thought

127
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,160
 I didn't like the filling very much, but they also had a cinnamon bun, which was very, very

128
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,840
 wonderful. And then they had beer and also curried goat. It was a good couple of hours.

129
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,040
 I could detect that the Armstapler, I probably would have had the Armstapler,

130
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,000
 which I don't know what principle of somebody hadn't ordered it first, but I could detect from a

131
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,520
 distance that it was going to disappoint me. I mean, Stephen's like this with Bonoffee Pies.

132
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,840
 You know, he always orders Bonoffee Pies whenever it's an option, and he's

133
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,000
 disappointed 99% of the time.

134
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,440
 Yeah, I think this is like me in Tiramisu. If I'm at Italian restaurant, I will almost always

135
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
 order the Tiramisu, and quite often be a little bit disappointed.

136
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,840
 Yeah, we had the Tiramisu at a pizza place in Newcastle, and it was like, it was a bit watery,

137
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,480
 and I was a bit like, oh, this is disappointing. It's got to be... yeah.

138
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,200
 The guy who invented Tiramisu died recently.

139
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,680
 Oh, that's sad. So, Julie... when we had Blockta, Julie used to make...

140
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,640
 so, Julie is Italian for people who don't know. Julie de Chasare, this is.

141
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,520
 She used to make Tiramisu at a giant turkey roasting tin for us, and she used to make

142
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,320
 an extra special one for Michael at the time didn't drink, so therefore didn't like the alcoholic

143
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,320
 content of Tiramisu. So, but in a smaller roasting tin. So, there was just this vast

144
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,040
 quantity of Tiramisu. You can't eat them vastly more than six adults, two children and a dog...

145
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,760
 a dog. Six adults, two children, a cat could possibly have eaten, and nevertheless,

146
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,440
 somehow we managed it every time, because it doesn't keep.

147
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,120
 There's a... if you ever visit Newcastle, which I will, there is a place called the Pink Lane

148
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,600
 Bakery, and they do my favorite Newcastle almond croissant, but they are not a coffee shop.

149
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,600
 What is your opinion on... ooh... places that are not a coffee shops? That's a very broad question,

150
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,480
 isn't it? Because it... oh yeah, that's quite complicated. So, I mean, are you saying places that

151
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,960
 serve almond croissant, but... and they're very, very good, but do not serve coffee, so you have to...

152
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,680
 they do serve coffee, and they do serve almond croissants. I've never had the coffee, so it might

153
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,360
 be terrible, and they also have nowhere to sit. Here's a counter. So, you take your almond croissant,

154
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,920
 and you sit somewhere... else? You maybe sit somewhere else, like,

155
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,280
 serves coffee, but then they might get the hump about you bringing food from other places.

156
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,800
 It's probably a summer activity, John. Obviously, what you need is a park. Yes, you need a park,

157
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,960
 which is near both the bakery which sells almond croissants, and maybe a little stall that sells

158
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,680
 good coffee. And on the 30 days a year when Newcastle's warm enough to use a park, I'm sure

159
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:27,280
 that's great. It's warm enough to use a park now, and it's March. I bet it is actually, it's lovely

160
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,600
 here this weekend. Yeah. I mean, global warming has its downsides, but the warmth in Newcastle is

161
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,880
 not one of them. Until the Gulf Stream goes away and it all goes horribly wrong. Oh yeah, then the

162
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,040
 coldness in Newcastle will be one of them. I've never tried making croissants because it seems

163
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,520
 like there are too many steps. Maybe one day. Massive, massive amount of work. Yeah. And then

164
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,960
 if you want an almond croissant, obviously, you have to make your croissants and then wait a day

165
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,800
 and then do all the French-Spanish almonds. Hmm, I think you could French-Spanish-Spanish

166
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:04,320
 almond them on day one. Yes, I don't know though. I think because Loon definitely keeps his,

167
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,800
 it bakes a load of croissants, and then it, and as it's selling more almond croissants than regular

168
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,920
 ones, it keeps a load of them for a day to make the almond croissants out of. But no, I've never

169
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,040
 made some, I've made laminated pastry a couple of times, but I generally speaking, I think there's

170
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,880
 a reason we haven't experts for this. Go find an expert, buy it from them. Oh yes. I think that's

171
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,960
 wise. In general, experts are good. That is the view of this podcast. Well, certainly for things

172
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,120
 like pastry chefs and plumbers. You're a plumber. If you're a plumber, write in. And that was the

173
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,160
 Octothorpe podcast, and it's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me. And it's goodbye from me.

174
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,520
 Hang on, did I actually press the stop recording button? I did not. I should do that.
