00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,000
Alison, Tammy thinks about the things she says before she says them. This is very new.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,900
I know, I know. 139 episodes and what is this nonsense?

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:27,440
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 139th episode of Octothorpe,

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,180
a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,720
which is coming to you on the 17th of July, 2025.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,120
It's the summer of fun!

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,340
Happy birthday, Tobes.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,540
I'm John Coxon.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,820
I'm Alison Scott.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,480
And I'm Tammy Coxon.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,180
Ooh.

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,620
Hey, hello Tammy.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,360
Hello.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,580
Hello Tammy.

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,700
Regular listeners will be aware that Tammy is not Liz.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,540
But I can be a stunt Liz.

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,380
Yes, indeed.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,580
I'm not Liz, but I play one on radio slash podcast.

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,240
How are you on the finer points of the Whistler's Constitution, Tammy?

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,080
I am fairly well acquainted.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,160
Do you want to do a kind of quick introduction to yourself for people

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,880
amongst our listenership who might not be familiar with your background in fandom?

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,760
Sure.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,800
So I've been involved with fandom since the late 90s.

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,540
I chaired Confusion, which is a local convention in the Detroit, Michigan area,

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,180
three times in a row.

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,540
And along the way of trying to learn about Confusion, I went to a Smofcon.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,880
And they recruited me to run World Cons.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,300
And this was back in 2000.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,040
And, you know, if you show up at Smofcon, then they'll recruit you immediately.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,060
And so I got connected to the next few World Cons.

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,180
And I was involved for a while.

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,280
And then I had a baby.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
And I gaffiated for eight years.

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,640
And I came back in 2012 and attended ChiCon.

36
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,900
And immediately threw my hat in the ring to run a NASVIC,

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,280
which I ran in Detroit in 2014.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,020
And found myself right back in the game.

39
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,980
Otherwise about me, I'm Canadian, but I've lived in the United States for the last 25 years,

40
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,800
although I'm about to move back to Toronto.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,420
Currently recording in Boston, Massachusetts.

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,760
I think I met you first time at that ChiCon, if I recall correctly.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Because obviously, when I see someone else with a very similar surname,

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
it's an unusual happenstance.

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
So, yeah.

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,660
And Tammy is the Hugo Administrator for LA Con 5.

47
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,320
So we'll be the Hugo Administrator in 2026.

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,180
Yes.

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,800
And I guess I didn't talk about things I did after DECOM,

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,340
but I've worked on Dublin.

51
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,240
I worked on Glasgow.

52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,400
I was the Hugo Administrator in 2020.

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,280
Worked on many of the last bunch of World Cons for the last 10 years.

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,260
Indeed, indeed.

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,260
So, yes.

56
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,080
And we'll be discussing a variety of things today.

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,620
And I think it's a good mix for your expertise, which will be fun to get your perspective.

58
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,860
I swear that I was asked to be stunt Liz before some of the things that we're talking about today

59
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,680
were even a twinkling in my mind.

60
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,380
Yes.

61
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,660
No, there has been a little bit of that.

62
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,480
I don't want to suggest that we do things just because of their news value.

63
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,840
Right.

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,340
Total coincidence.

65
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,540
Yes.

66
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,920
Yes, it was.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,880
We have some letters of comment.

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,180
And we start, as we so often do, with a letter from Christopher J. Garcia.

69
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,380
Chris says that he thinks e-books are the way for judges and he's pro-translated work, Hugo.

70
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,340
But I think Chris is pro pretty much all Hugos.

71
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,160
So, yeah.

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm not sure that's surprising.

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,420
No, I think Chris is definitely not on team.

74
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,040
Let's limit the number of Hugos.

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Chris would like to see everything get a Hugo, which I understand.

76
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,740
Yeah.

77
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,800
He also says he's a Montreal food node and will be doing a poutine tour.

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,780
What is a poutine tour?

79
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,700
Do you know what poutine is, John?

80
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,700
I do know what poutine is.

81
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,580
Well, many, many venues in Montreal offer poutine.

82
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,520
And so I expect that Chris is going to lead a crawl that will get slower and slower and slower

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,160
as people load up with poutine.

84
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,820
Yeah.

85
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,080
No.

86
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,380
So I went to Montreal in 2009 and I had poutine.

87
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,300
And whereas on a pub crawl, you're supposed to have pints,

88
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,860
but obviously I have halves or nowadays even thirds.

89
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,560
I feel like the amount of poutine I'm going to eat in an evening is approximately 70% of

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,320
a portion of poutine.

91
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,500
So I think if you just go and you get one plate of poutine and everyone shares it and then you

92
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,840
go to the next spot and you get another plate of poutine, that might be manageable.

93
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,720
Yeah.

94
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,980
I think, yeah, it depends how many people are on the crawl and whether you can share, right?

95
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,620
Germs.

96
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,720
I think we're supposed to care about germs now, aren't we?

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,080
I'm not sure how the venues are going to feel about 15 people walking in and sharing one

98
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,720
plate of poutine.

99
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,400
But, you know, you could try.

100
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Our poutine kills all known germs.

101
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,280
No, that sounds interesting and fun.

102
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,680
Chris is all for consultative polling.

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,260
He had no idea it was happening, but he's also not a member.

104
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,060
Which fair.

105
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,280
We heard from Mike Glyer by email and Mike wrote, I'm surprised how invested you guys

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,760
are in downplaying the interest in the consultative vote collapsed between Glasgow and Seattle.

107
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,980
I think we did discuss this last episode.

108
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,320
I mean, I know Mike reads the transcript instead of listening to the episode.

109
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:35,360
But to be clear, I am not sure that the numbers reflect any lack of interest in the votership

110
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,300
so much as they do a lack of communication from Seattle.

111
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,060
Yeah, I'm not sure if you guys talked about this last time, but I really think that Nicholas

112
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,080
White nailed this one, which is that like the consultative vote ran for too short of a time

113
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,960
and too far ahead of the convention, where last year it ran, I think for the same amount of

114
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,540
time, but much closer to the calm when people were more engaged and thinking about things.

115
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,320
That's what I'd, that plus communication is what I'd attribute it to.

116
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,520
Yeah, and I think we said last time that these categories are not as exciting as the ones that

117
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,860
came up for last year's consultative vote and not of interest to as many people.

118
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,080
That makes sense too.

119
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,500
I confess I only voted in one of the votes.

120
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,780
I didn't vote in the other one.

121
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,120
So, excuse me, I'm not sure that it is due to a lack of interest in being consulted,

122
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,480
if that makes sense.

123
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,580
Thank you for writing in, Chris.

124
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,920
Colette Reap wrote to us to say that the Hinkley Island Hotel, which we will, or many of us will

125
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,300
remember fondly from Eastercon's past, but some of us might have been too young, is now the Leonardo

126
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,980
Hotel, part of the Leonardo Change, 294 hotels across Europe. I have just had an email telling me

127
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,480
that the 2026 Discworld Convention will be held there. And I'm quite excited by this because we didn't

128
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,840
stop using the Hinkley Island Hotel because it was in a terrible location. We stopped using it

129
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,240
because it changed hands and the new owners didn't want to put a convention there. So I think it's

130
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,040
definitely a site that it's worth having in the mix, even though it's not the best place. It is a

131
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:13,100
motorway junction. It could be a lot better. But the hotel, the hotel itself's got quite good

132
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,520
function space and layout for an Eastercon. So people should definitely go have a chat to it about it.

133
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,920
I got this image now of someone approaching the hotel and just sort of talking to the walls,

134
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,880
which would be very good.

135
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,480
Yep, that's an art prompt.

136
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,640
This has happened, I'm sure, more than once.

137
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:40,400
I mean, yeah, almost certainly, right? It would be good to have more places to hold Eastercons in

138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,340
the UK. So I think that is definitely true. It will also be four trains for me to get to it,

139
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:56,300
which will be fun. And then a 45 minute walk. But that's all right. It really is an awful place to

140
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,000
actually get to if you're not driving. But no bus goes there. So it is just a 45 minute walk from the

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,480
nearest train station with luggage. So that's... Or you could take a taxi, I guess. Thank you for writing

142
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,860
in Colette. I mean, I think that's the sort of thing where you take cab fares as part of your

143
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,460
overall cost of the weekend, because my guess is that the hotel is cheaper than, say, the Birmingham

144
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,660
Metropole. Interesting assertion. It's just been... It's just been refurbished, so it might not be.

145
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,060
Yeah, we could look that up. We could look it up right now instead of doing a podcast.

146
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,560
There can't be that many hotels in Hinkley, he said confident.

147
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,860
Where is Hinkley?

148
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,120
Near Leicester.

149
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,100
That doesn't actually help me as much as you would think, but that's my failings in British

150
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,880
geography. Okay.

151
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:51,180
It's in the East Midlands. So sort of northeast of London. Probably about two hour train ride away

152
00:08:51,180 --> 00:09:00,280
from London-ish. But it's between Leicester and Birmingham, effectively. I... And, like, I am very

153
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:08,880
fond of Leicester, but have not ever made Hinkley a destination to visit. Hinkley seems to be about

154
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,760
150 quid a night, so it's in the... in that kind of rate. But it looks very pretty, so, you know,

155
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,780
it's got a pool.

156
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:21,160
It did not look like that when I was last there, I can tell you. It was the hotel where

157
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,100
most of the rooms have mirrors on the ceiling.

158
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,260
I mean, I... yes. That, I don't... I'm not averse to mirrors. I'm not a vampire.

159
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,400
Yeah, it does look like Hinkley is mostly just a wide spot on the road.

160
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,020
Yep. Well, the clue is in the word island, because it's the island in the middle of a motorway junction,

161
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,500
I think.

162
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,240
Right.

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,460
We also heard from Farrah Mendelsohn, who told us that a BSFA thing passed. So that's good.

164
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:53,460
A proposal for a translated works award, which would recognise both the author and the translator.

165
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,500
Jurors can't be involved with works. Like, so if a juror is involved with the work, then that work is

166
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,680
ineligible. The jury is selected by the chair and executive board. They will assemble a shortlist.

167
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:13,360
They will serve three-year terms. They recommend successors. And there will be perhaps a jury

168
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,680
administrator who is a non-judging administrator. So that all seems very interesting. We will see how

169
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,820
that goes as it kind of gets underway. And Neil Harrison wrote in about the best translated work,

170
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,220
Hugo, with a six-point email.

171
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,920
Yeah, this is all on the idea of an award for best translated work. I think it is an idea worth

172
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,860
pursuing. It should be a not a Hugo and other awards could be encouraged to consider similar

173
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,740
categories. And he gives some examples.

174
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,540
Second point, I agree there appears to be a general lack of awareness among the voters and that this also

175
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,400
needs to be addressed for the category to be viable. But having a category would be a signal that this is

176
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,980
an area worth being aware of.

177
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:02,060
Neil says that he doesn't think there's a general lack of eligible books. And he says that I made a

178
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,900
point about three Clark submissions. And I would like to say I did not make a point about three Clark

179
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,940
submissions. I said I had read three books in translation, which is very different. I was merely

180
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,700
pointing out I'm, I think, probably more well read than most in this year's SF. And even I have only

181
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,400
read three. But there were definitely more than three books submitted to the Clark that were translations

182
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,700
last year.

183
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,160
As a Hugo admin, I appreciate his next point. Also, how many people use all of their nominating

184
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,100
slots in every category anyway? One of the things that people correctly say around nominations time is

185
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,620
you don't have to have a full ballot to be able to nominate. And that is definitely very true. There

186
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,540
are lots of people who don't fill in every category. And then there are people who fill in every category,

187
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,560
in every, every slot in every category on their ballot.

188
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,320
There are. One channel challenge with a Hugo that was not discussed is Hugo nominees are often people

189
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,260
with established careers. In a popular vote award, you have to be popular. And that's easier if you

190
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,300
have a track record. But you often only get one book from a writer in translation or books so

191
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,280
frequently that they don't build up momentum. Having said that, last year had some good examples.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, so he mentions A View from the Stars by Sishin Liu and Haruki Murakami's The City and Its

193
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,660
Undertained Walls. And he also, he recommends some books from this year. And what I'm going to do is

194
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,980
I'm going to prod him to put these on his blog and we will link to it in the show notes.

195
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,200
Excellent.

196
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,740
I think this is an interesting point because it's kind of like the retro Hugos where people vote for

197
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,840
someone based on their reputation and not actually on the validity of the work. So that could be a risk

198
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,400
in a translation category because people will say, oh, I didn't read anything in translated work,

199
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,460
but I recognize this person's name. I'll put this on my ballot.

200
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,240
It's an interesting, that's interesting because do you, hang on, let me, the point you made a minute

201
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,460
ago, Tammy, about the retro Hugos and people voting on reputation is interesting to me because in general,

202
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:08,160
I think most people would say that the retro Hugo has not really successfully gotten people to go back

203
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,160
and read classic SF. It has mostly encouraged people to vote for names they know from their general

204
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,340
experience that happened to have existed in the past and it hasn't really led a horse to water in

205
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:26,300
any meaningful way. Do you think that best translation is more likely to actually change people's reading

206
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:33,800
or do you think that it is more likely to just be people recognizing the big names sort of more?

207
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:40,460
I don't know, right? I mean, I could really see it going both ways. If the only things that are getting

208
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,480
sufficient nominations to get on the ballot are names that are already known,

209
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,060
then that's just going to encourage people to read those names. And is the reputational impact

210
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:56,320
greater than the ability to get new works on the ballot or works that might be even better,

211
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,960
but people just aren't aware of? So that's, that would be my concern there. And I don't really know

212
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,400
which way I fall. I just, it's something that I thought of as I, as I read this letter of comment.

213
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, no, it was, I had not really thought of any of this in the light of the retro Hugo at all,

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,780
but when you said it got me thinking, so that's an interesting one.

215
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,040
I think the value proposition of doing it is that it would expose people to new authors. I know that

216
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,100
that's like the people who are behind the translated works who go want it to be that avenue, but I think

217
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,600
this is a good point. Like, will it or will it not accomplish that?

218
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,140
And actually, yeah, no, it'll be, it'll be interesting to see how it goes if it does end up happening.

219
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,760
Do you think, from your vantage point as someone who's quite embedded in Hugo administration,

220
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,000
do you think it's like, like, what do you think the mood of, of the community is on,

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,600
on this proposal? Do you think it's been well received? Or do you think it's got like a little

222
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,420
ways to go before it gets widespread exception, acceptance?

223
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,820
I don't think I've heard very much about it yet. People are just kind of beginning to talk about it

224
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,200
now. I will say that most Hugo administrators of my acquaintance don't want there to be a lot more

225
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,140
Hugo awards, and I would agree with that. I mean, we're already at a stage where it's very difficult,

226
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,840
and so every award that we add, you know, increases the complexity. That to me, it's,

227
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,240
it kind of at some point becomes a numbers game and does everything need to get a Hugo award.

228
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:26,580
Raj wrote in on Mastodon with a lock on 137, and he's, he asks, if you could trim down the Hugo

229
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,940
categories, what would you get rid of? Is that, can you answer that? Or is it like,

230
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:37,760
they're all your equally favourite children? I guess you can't. Maybe I should ask when Liz is back.

231
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,420
You definitely can't answer that, can you? I mean, I certainly can't answer it from a,

232
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,660
from an, in any sort of an official capacity.

233
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,720
That's fair. That's fair.

234
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,360
That's always such a challenging question, right? Because the Hugo awards serve multiple functions.

235
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,060
They're recognising the work that people in our community do, that professionals primarily,

236
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,480
and also fans. I wouldn't want to see any of the fan categories go away. And then, you know,

237
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,860
when you start talking about getting rid of professional categories,

238
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,520
editor categories, they're certainly the ones where the voters have the least insight into what's

239
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,120
happening in those categories. But the work that editors do is incredibly important to our community,

240
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,400
and they're an important part of the community. And so getting rid of those Hugos feels like it's

241
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,280
ignoring that. So it's, it's a challenge, and I don't know how to do it.

242
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,780
Okay. We also had some letters on Facebook.

243
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:38,560
Facebook. And I'm just going to pull one out by, by Ivan Sinner, who says, his trade union conference

244
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,740
has a rule that if emotion is lost at the union conference, it can't be heard again for three

245
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,800
years. And that goes back to the point we're making about lots of things on the agenda for

246
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,880
the business meetings. And we'll touch on the business meeting later, because we, well, Tammy and I were both

247
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:58,880
at the online business meeting, the first part of it anyway, Seattle is running on Lumi. I think

248
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,700
that is an interesting approach. What do you think about that, Tammy? Do you think that would work?

249
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,220
Or?

250
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,660
I actually thought it was really intriguing. I think it requires some infrastructure to support

251
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,880
it, right? So I think you need to have some pretty robust way for people to put their proposals up for

252
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,820
public comment and have some asynchronous communication and discussion before it ever gets to the point

253
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,200
where there's a vote. So a lot of the things like wordsmithing and amendments and things like that,

254
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,520
that happen and take up a ton of time in the business meeting are happening ahead. And then yeah,

255
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:39,520
if it gets through that whole stage and then gets to the vote and it fails, then maybe it should just

256
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,660
go away for a little while.

257
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,200
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think I basically agree with that.

258
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:52,260
Yeah, I think I have the sense that you'll get a bunch of people, Wilcon, Wusfus people going,

259
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,720
okay, so we need to really test how little we can change this motion before it can come back.

260
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,940
Maybe I'm just an old cynic.

261
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,260
Well, there must be a way. I mean, I'm gonna tell, I mean, I'm sure you know this, but just for

262
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:12,140
listeners, trade unions are not less fractious than Wusfus. So if a trade union can do it,

263
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,020
there must be a way for Wusfus to be able to do it. Maybe Ivan has some insight into how they have

264
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,500
actually encoded this in their rules. So if you do, Ivan, please, please get back in touch.

265
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:36,220
Last episode, listeners, you will recall we mentioned Montreal. We reported that the bid chair,

266
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,060
Terry Fong, had stepped down for personal reasons and had been replaced by Darren Briskman.

267
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:49,160
Since then, there has been a development and we mentioned that Robbie Bourget had said that there

268
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,300
had been a miscommunication between the bid and Kansmoff. And since then, Kansmoff has announced that

269
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:01,640
Bruce Farr is being added as a co-chair of the bid, which given Robbie's post on File 770 makes it sound

270
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,280
quite a lot like that is something the bid did not have an awful lot of agency in. But Bruce Farr is,

271
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:15,580
I think, well regarded in the community. And then since then, Tammy has written an excellent op-ed on File 770.

272
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,160
I was very pleased to see that Bruce Farr had been added as co-chair because everything I've heard

273
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,880
about him suggests that he's an effective and capable and experienced con runner and that will

274
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:33,220
be great for the bid. And if that's come about as a result of Kansmoff looking at the bid and saying it

275
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,300
needed to have a little bit more weight behind it, I'm really enthusiastic about that too because I think

276
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,680
the purpose of having, if you're going to have an oversight board for a science fiction convention,

277
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,560
it's nice to see that they're actually acting and doing some work.

278
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:53,960
And I will say that I started writing my op-ed about 24 hours before the announcement came out that

279
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,520
Bruce Farr had been appointed as an additional bid chair. And that definitely made me feel better. I have

280
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,600
worked with Bruce a lot. He really knows his stuff. He's very competent con runner. So that definitely made

281
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,220
me happy to see. Not really happy enough because, you know, he's just a bid chair and, you know,

282
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,540
who's going to run the convention is still this really big question.

283
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:25,060
Yeah. So you asked Montreal on Blue Sky whether they had decided who would be the chair of the

284
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,520
convention and they have not yet decided that. Is that right?

285
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,880
Right. So they have not yet decided. So, John, you asked me to summarize sort of what I wrote for

286
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,840
the op-ed. This is basically just observations about the state of the bid compared to where I would

287
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:47,560
expect a bid to be. And that Montreal really hasn't been bidding in the way that we expect people to bid.

288
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,100
We haven't gotten a lot of information from them, especially as those changes started to come

289
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,600
through. I was particularly disturbed by the fact that they hadn't even updated their website.

290
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,420
That feels like the very base level we would expect from a Worldcon bid to keep updated information

291
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,820
available. Even now, many things on their website haven't been updated since 2024. So I just am really

292
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:16,020
concerned about their ability to run a Worldcon based on what we've seen so far. And this was just

293
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,520
trying to make people aware of the fact that just because a site has run a Worldcon successfully in

294
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,120
the past doesn't mean that they can do it again. Right? Locations are not people and people are who

295
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:35,080
run Worldcon. And also, sort of, we know that Pemmicon didn't go perfectly, I think it's fair to say.

296
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,280
And there's presumably some overlap between the Pemmicon team and the Montreal team, which is a point you

297
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,920
make in the article. Right. So CanSmoff was the sponsor of Pemmicon. They were the

298
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,420
sponsor of the Montreal Smofcon in 2022. And a whole bunch of people who are involved with

299
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:58,040
Montreal Bib were also involved with the Smofcon in 2024. None of those conventions performed at a

300
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:04,400
high level. Right? They aren't inspiring me to think that they will be able to perform at a high level

301
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,020
for a Worldcon. And it is a worrying thing. Right. And the point that I made in the article,

302
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,300
and some people may have taken this as me trying to, I don't know, set myself up to run a Worldcon.

303
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,080
I don't want to run a Worldcon. I think it's an incredibly hard job. As I said in the piece,

304
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,860
I think Montreal's motives were really good. Right? They wanted to fill in a gap in the schedule.

305
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,180
They're like, we need a Worldcon in 2027. We know how to do this.

306
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:38,360
That's based on their experience in 2009. And 2009 was fine. We went to it. We had a really good time.

307
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,080
There were some things we didn't like about it. But on the whole, it was perfectly adequate,

308
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,940
well gone, I think. But that's quite a long time ago. And I think it's likely that a lot of the

309
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,920
experience is different. And they have just kind of demonstrated that they didn't run a very good

310
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:59,340
NASFIC. So it feels to me like if you don't demonstrate you can run a NASFIC, it's not unreasonable

311
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:05,540
for people to have some doubts about your ability to run a Worldcon, which is really very significantly

312
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:13,040
harder. Right. And that NASFIC in particular could have been very large, right? Like for most people,

313
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,180
there was not a functional Worldcon that year. They weren't going to go to Chengdu. Time zones meant

314
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,960
even if they could connect to the online, they weren't going to. So I think an ambitious group of

315
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,200
convention runners could have had a 2,000 to 3,000 person NASFIC. And I think Pemacom was about 500

316
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,620
people. Their online programming didn't even work very well. That was my experience with the Montreal

317
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,320
SmoughCon that was run by CanSmoff as well. They promised virtual, they didn't deliver on it. There

318
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,340
were a number of other problems with that convention. And so I just have seen this pattern from CanSmoff

319
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:53,500
conventions that make me really worry about what could happen with Montreal. And some of my motivations in

320
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,740
writing this wasn't because I want to run a Worldcon. I don't want to run a Worldcon. But I do feel like

321
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:05,700
if we continue to have Worldcons that are the center of scandal, and we keep getting in the mainstream

322
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:12,300
press about it, and people already say online, oh, Worldcon, something bad happens every year. Worldcon

323
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:18,420
can't ever get anything right. And they miss the great Worldcons like Glasgow, like Chicago, who got a lot

324
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,380
of things right, that it just gets harder and harder to run a Worldcon. It gets harder to convince people

325
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:30,660
to come. It just, it takes an incredibly difficult job and makes it even harder. And I don't want to

326
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,580
burn Conrunners out trying to run a Con that they're not ready to run. And I don't want to hurt fans. And

327
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
I, you know, it's just, it's really, really hard.

328
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,580
Yeah, this is like, I mean, this is something that we have to balance on the pod, right? Because

329
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,460
we want to be able to critique and criticize things that we don't think are right. But we also

330
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:55,680
want to bear in mind that it's volunteer run and it's hard. Sometimes you have to criticize. I do think

331
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:02,600
that Montreal, it is difficult to imagine that if Montreal was bidding in a year that had more

332
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,860
competition, I think they would probably not win the bid. Well, because they are now the only bid that

333
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:14,720
has filed, they are very likely to win. And I think it is going to mean a pretty, I mean, if the Worldcon

334
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,800
is run as lackadaisically as the bid has been, and has, you know, is run like Pemicon was, that doesn't

335
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,060
say to me it's going to be a great success. And that sucks, because I'd much rather be sitting here saying

336
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:34,460
this looks great. But if it doesn't look great, it's incumbent on us to point that out, I think. Not being

337
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,480
disrespectful of the work being put in. But yeah, it's, it's, you can't pretend that it's going to be

338
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,740
great if most of the evidence points to it probably not being. To follow on with what you were just

339
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,600
saying, John, I think it's interesting. So one of my major areas of concern is that there is no convention

340
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,920
chair, right? And the convention chair sets the tone of the convention, it sets the vision, they're a huge

341
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,300
part of recruitment, because you need to know who your leadership is going to be before you know

342
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:08,420
whether you want to work on a convention, especially at a high level, like a DH level. And so that's been

343
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:16,400
my major concern. And when Montreal published their response to my op ed, mostly was a puff piece,

344
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,800
right? It was mostly about the city, talked about, you know, why you would want to come to Montreal still

345
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,320
didn't say much about their vision for the convention. But I think they kind of really buried the lead,

346
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,380
because in the final paragraph where they're encouraging people to volunteer, it says to

347
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:36,700
contact them if you have suggestions on who should be the convention chair. And that just seems like an

348
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,600
admission of we're really challenged here, we don't have a deep bit of people who want to do this job.

349
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,760
But they bury it at the very end of their response, which I thought was startling. I didn't even notice

350
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,400
it the first time around, because I was like, Oh, look, they're just asking for volunteers. And then I

351
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,540
realized that was one of the things they were asking for.

352
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,220
Oh, yes, I read that sentence. I read the first third of the sentence,

353
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,660
or the last third of the sentence, and not the middle third of the sentence, which is

354
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,280
a thing that I might do sometime. I had not seen that.

355
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,200
And Alison, you're probably the third or fourth person who, when I've pointed that out to says,

356
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,460
I hadn't seen that. I mean, I hadn't seen it the first time I read it. I was like,

357
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,540
whoa, what does that say?

358
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,380
Well, and you because it's so far outside what you're expecting that article to conclude with,

359
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,940
that you probably don't, you have to really be paying attention. And I assume that implies that

360
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:33,620
the plan was for Terry to be the con chair, and him standing down as bid chair means that they really

361
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:39,440
don't have a plan for what's going to happen. Because I assume that that means they've only

362
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,160
been thinking about this for the last four weeks or so. Do you think that's fair?

363
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,220
I'm not sure that's true. I know when I spoke to Terry right when the bid launched,

364
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,140
and I asked him who's going to be the chair, he sort of shrugged and said, well, I think I am.

365
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:58,560
Well, it didn't sound very enthusiastic about it, or I guess it'll be me. It was something like that.

366
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,140
And then I know in conversation with them and at SmofCon, they expressed they hadn't decided who

367
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,420
would be chair, and they were looking at various people to potentially be chair. So I think that

368
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,260
search has been ongoing. I don't know if they had decided on Terry before he stepped down,

369
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,700
or if there was still a question mark there.

370
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,260
Yeah, okay. Interesting.

371
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:25,920
I feel like having worked with Esther and been her friend over the last, I guess, decade through Glasgow,

372
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:34,060
the amount of work she did as chair in making the convention match her vision of what WorldCon

373
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:40,120
should be, and ensuring that just an enormous, because she recruited personally and through her staff,

374
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,740
huge numbers of people who had never worked on WorldCons before, including many who had never

375
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,660
been to WorldCon before and actually got them kind of all pointing in the right direction and making

376
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:55,540
the convention. And just such a lot of leadership. And that's what I feel like we're missing here.

377
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:02,380
And we have consistently missed from Montreal is that sense of a leadership vision and a plan.

378
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,820
So how do you, I mean, running WorldCons really, I think about, you know, other WorldCon shares I've

379
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,620
known and they've had a bit about them, you know?

380
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,080
Right. And I said this in the op-ed, you have to really want to run a WorldCon. And I just don't

381
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,460
get any vibe from Montreal that they really want to run a WorldCon, right? I think Helen Montgomery

382
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,560
pointed this out in a File 770 comment. There's like no vision on the website. There's no,

383
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,980
here's what we plan to do with our WorldCon. It's just that sort of what we would expect from a bid

384
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,420
hasn't happened. They haven't really been bidding because they haven't had to. They haven't had to

385
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:43,080
get people excited. One of you mentioned before that the last WorldCon they ran was 2009. And I

386
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:49,280
think it's really critical to think that that was before social media and this is after. And I feel

387
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,820
like they're a little bit bidding like you would for 2009 and not bidding for the world that we're in

388
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,920
today, which is much more demanding of WorldCons, much more demanding of bids, expects different kinds

389
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,720
of information flows that we just haven't seen. So that is that little bit of relying too much on

390
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,740
the way it used to be done and not being ready for the challenges of a modern WorldCon.

391
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:16,840
Yeah. And even then, like, I remember my, I didn't go to the 2009 WorldCon because,

392
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:23,360
for various reasons, my first WorldCon was Reno in 2011. But I remember most of the discussion of it

393
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,140
kind of when people came back was not wholly positive even then. So I didn't get the impression it was

394
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:37,420
kind of one of the all-time great conventions. Although people did seem to generally have fun.

395
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:44,500
The thing that really surprised me about Pemmicon was that it was more negative than that. It sort of

396
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,020
didn't seem like many people had much good to say about it, which I think is a bit worrying.

397
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:55,940
So you have a proposal for what we should do instead of voting for Montreal?

398
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:03,640
I don't know that I would go so far to say it is a proposal. So how I close my op-ed is that if I

399
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:10,040
don't see Montreal being ready to run a WorldCon, then I will probably vote none of the above.

400
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:16,860
When none of the above happens, the business meeting is asked to either award the WorldCon to someone.

401
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,780
If none of the above should win, the business meeting is asked to award the convention to somebody.

402
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,580
That could be somebody who stands up and says, I'm going to run it in my backyard.

403
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,220
You know, they could do that at the business meeting or to pass the duty of figuring out who

404
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,280
will run the WorldCon to the next year's WorldCon. And I have said that if that happens, I will stand

405
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,820
up at the business meeting and I will say that I will run a minimally viable WorldCon. So I'll make sure

406
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:48,380
the Hugo administration business meeting and site selection happen in 2027 so we can have more WorldCons

407
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:55,080
moving down the line. But it wouldn't have a physical component. It wouldn't have any of the things that we

408
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:02,400
otherwise associate with a WorldCon. I don't want that to happen in 2027. I want there to be a good WorldCon

409
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:10,780
in 2027. And I hope that by raising some awareness about this, we can somehow make that happen. That's really my goal

410
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:17,640
here. And the fact that they did appoint Bruce Farr as a bid chair makes me a little more optimistic. I just hope that

411
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,940
there are conrunners who can step up and want to help. It's hard for me, you know, people have said to me, why don't you

412
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,840
just, you know, why don't you volunteer? Why aren't you working for Montreal? Because I don't know who the leadership is.

413
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,880
And that's really important to me. I've had to step down from conrunning positions in the past when it was

414
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,820
just not an environment that I felt like I could work in. And so I can't make any commitments until I know

415
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:45,800
who's there. Yeah, I think that's fair. And obviously, it's very critical in volunteer roles where you're

416
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:52,640
spending a lot of time and effort in your spare time, right? Like, I've definitely been in situations

417
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,800
where I've stood down from conrunning roles for similar reasons where it's turned out that the people above me

418
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,460
in the convention of people I really don't enjoy working with. And that's not a vibe I want to

419
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,980
bring into my personal life if I can help it. Right. I'm happy to go through hell with my comrades

420
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:15,720
at arms, right? But yeah, no, exactly. When you don't have that, that shared allegiance, then it's just

421
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,360
harder when you don't have those people that you really care about and that, you know, have your back.

422
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,220
Yeah, I think that's right.

423
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:27,780
If the bid chairs were planning to step up and be the convention chairs,

424
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,600
don't you think they'd have said so by now?

425
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,320
Oh, yeah, I assume.

426
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,620
Do they have other plans for a chair? I think you may have a good point about social media. This is the thing I was going to say.

427
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:47,080
Tom Becker mentioned, and I remember, of course, that Terry was at Eastercon running a table and promoting the bid.

428
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:53,320
And obviously, promoting bids in person on a table is important. It's more important than I thought it was in

429
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:00,400
2018 when I was like, oh, no, Eastercon doesn't need to have a table at the WorldCon in Helsinki.

430
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,200
And I was so wrong about that. So, you know, I think a table is part of what you do to promote your bid.

431
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:15,360
But I think it's not the only thing you can do now because a lot of people coalesce around your effective social media presence,

432
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:22,120
that having a social media site that's just pumping out interesting things about the bid, interesting things about the team,

433
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,480
interesting things about the city, interesting things about the plans for the convention.

434
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,140
Every day or so on social media makes it just a huge difference. And they're just not doing that at all.

435
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:36,200
Right. And there are just ways that you use social media. I mean, I think it's notable that, you know,

436
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,920
and I don't want to pile on. I'm not sure how useful this is. Right.

437
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:44,600
But there are ways to use social media that aren't being taken advantage of.

438
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,020
So on Blue Sky, the Montreal bid has very few followers because they're following no one.

439
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,040
How do you drive engagement? How do you get people to follow you? You follow them. Right.

440
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,000
There's just kind of this lack of understanding about how social media works.

441
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,220
And I would say in our modern Worldcon environment, like understanding how social media works is essential to your survival,

442
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,900
because you're going to have, if you're lucky, only one or two internet firestorms fall on your head.

443
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:20,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. And the other thing is that like is because it is also important to have tables at conventions.

444
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,660
But I was also a bit surprised that the Montreal table was being staffed by Terry.

445
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,680
And I don't know how many other people I saw working it.

446
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:38,380
Whereas I would have assumed most bids would have sort of a UK agent who would be able to do that without it needing the chair to travel.

447
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,600
And Terry comes to British conventions. So maybe he was keen.

448
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,320
But yeah, I don't know. There's just some little weirdnesses. Right.

449
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,920
It's old. Right. And that's why I wrote it. Right. Because it's I think people just weren't paying attention.

450
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,700
People are like, oh, it's Montreal. They did it before. They'll do it again.

451
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,600
And I'm sure they will. There will be probably there.

452
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,080
There will be a hotel and Montreal is a great city.

453
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,820
And so, you know, maybe I'm I'm overly concerned.

454
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,440
But I did think a lot of people weren't paying attention.

455
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,700
And I think people also haven't been paying attention to 2028.

456
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,460
And I mentioned that in the piece and it kind of went a little bit unnoticed.

457
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:25,480
But then Mike Glyer called something out a few days later about what the status update on the 2028 bids are.

458
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:33,240
Because Brisbane and Kigali are also not really bidding kind of at all and certainly not bidding very effectively.

459
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,800
And in the last couple of days, there has been a change from Brisbane.

460
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,640
They have started asking for help.

461
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,800
They have posted inquiries.

462
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,500
But based on what they've said so far, and this is mostly on the business meeting server,

463
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,220
the bid is essentially being driven by one person.

464
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,680
And no one involved with the bid has any Worldcon experience.

465
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,920
It's by their own admission.

466
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,120
So I feel like they're at the stage where they don't know what they don't know.

467
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,100
People are now stepping up because they've asked for help.

468
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,720
And people are coming in and saying, here's here's what you need to know.

469
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,760
But I wouldn't be surprised if they went, oh, wait, we can't do that.

470
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,020
We didn't know we had to do all those things.

471
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:19,320
They have previously had very experienced Australian conrunners listed as advisors to the bid.

472
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,400
I'm not sure whether those people are.

473
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,080
I think that they gave them some advice.

474
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,860
I'm not sure whether that advice has been acted on or taken to heart.

475
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,040
I think part of the advice was, oh, no, don't do that.

476
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,100
But I mean, once they'd accepted that, they did probably want to do that.

477
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:41,080
And I think there is a general acceptance in Australian fandom that it might be time to have

478
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,200
another go because it's been a little while.

479
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,660
And I think it would be great.

480
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:50,580
And one of the things I've communicated to the Brisbane team or the bid chair anyway,

481
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,420
is that there is a lot of goodwill in the same way that people are like, oh, yeah, Montreal,

482
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,220
we've been there before.

483
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:55,820
We can go back.

484
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,280
People are like, Australia, awesome.

485
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,360
I want to go back.

486
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,660
They ran a WorldCom before.

487
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,520
They'll do it again.

488
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,460
But there's more goodwill, I think, towards Australia at this point than there is to Montreal.

489
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,700
And so they need to capitalize on that and communicate to people.

490
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,400
We actually need a lot of help.

491
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,880
And they have started that communication.

492
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,640
So I'm glad that that's happening with enough of a timeline that it's possible.

493
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,700
And I should say there is, of course, another bidder for 2028, which is Kigali.

494
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,660
The former Ugandan WorldCom has now switched to bidding for Rwanda.

495
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,480
And they're kind of even worse off in that regard, right?

496
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,040
Like, you know, they because of restrictions on travel for people in the global south,

497
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,400
they can't go to cons.

498
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,980
It's harder for them to get opportunities to learn even than it is for Australia.

499
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,340
But that's sort of like embedding yourself in existing WorldCons and working on them

500
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,900
and making sure the people who are going to be running the WorldCon know what it's like

501
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,520
is really, really important.

502
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,340
And neither one of them have done it.

503
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,560
And that's really something I'd like to see both bidders step up and do to the extent they can.

504
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,460
And just to let listeners know, so the last Australian WorldCom was in 2010.

505
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,160
So it will be an 18-year gap if Brisbane is selected.

506
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,140
And Kigali has never hosted a...

507
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,480
There's never been an African WorldCom before anywhere on the continent.

508
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,740
There's probably not a huge amount of institutional knowledge on either part.

509
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,460
Because, you know, I'm sure previous Australian WorldCons have been great,

510
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,740
but 18 years is a long time for that institutional knowledge to stick around.

511
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,480
And then 2029 is Dublin, which is a vibrant bid full of enthusiastic people who,

512
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,120
broadly speaking, have experience and are plugged into the community.

513
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:46,680
But obviously, they will be being voted on at the 2027 WorldCon.

514
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,540
So this all has ramifications for them as well, right?

515
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,220
Right.

516
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,860
I think they'd very much like there to be a WorldCon, right?

517
00:39:53,860 --> 00:40:01,080
They'd very much like for people to be engaged and buying voting tokens and voting for Dublin

518
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,860
and site selection, because that provides this really important, you know, nest egg for a

519
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,000
convention financially.

520
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,840
Absolutely.

521
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,640
Yeah.

522
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,680
And I think it goes without saying, we'd all three of us quite like...

523
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,340
Well, I mean, I assume I'm right in speaking for both of you.

524
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,800
But if I'm wrong, I'm sure you'll tell me.

525
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,940
Like, in general, I think we all want WorldCons to happen that are good.

526
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,500
Yep.

527
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,020
Yeah.

528
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:26,000
At a variety of places around the world that are not just the United States and Europe.

529
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,440
And I think there's this bigger perception that people have to perhaps start rethinking.

530
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,040
I don't think even if people wanted to travel to the United States for WorldCons,

531
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,540
that there are that many pending United States WorldCon locations either.

532
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,460
I don't think there are people lined up eager to run WorldCons.

533
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,220
And I know I'm a big downer on this, right?

534
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,400
But I think it is a really, really hard thing to do.

535
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,580
And it's much harder than it used to be.

536
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,840
And I don't blame anybody who doesn't want to give up their whole life to it.

537
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,140
You know, it is a second full-time job for someone.

538
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,760
The only upcoming US bids are Texas in 31 and Minneapolis in 73.

539
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,140
And Minneapolis in 73 is a joke.

540
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,780
So I do think it is.

541
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,900
We have successfully put the world in WorldCon now.

542
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:22,620
Like the US is not bidding for a majority of WorldCons at this point in time.

543
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,760
Two Canadian, one Australian, one Rwandan and one Irish.

544
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:35,360
I watched the extent to which Eastercon got harder from 1995 to 2018 to 2023.

545
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,460
People kind of go, oh, but they got bigger, but they didn't.

546
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,480
I mean, 2018 was bigger than 1995, but 1995 was a walk-on year.

547
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,860
It was just about a thousandth as much work as the 2023 Eastercon.

548
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,660
Yeah, I ran some numbers a while back.

549
00:41:50,660 --> 00:42:00,040
And, you know, projecting out to 2029 with who I thought the likely locations would be,

550
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,720
60% of WorldCons from 2015 to 2029.

551
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:12,960
So over a 15-year period, 60% of them will be outside the US and 47% of them outside of North America.

552
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,140
So it really is a big difference.

553
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:21,700
In the previous 15 years, it was 40% outside the US and 27% outside North America.

554
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,660
No, it seems like it's been a big shift.

555
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,460
And I think that's reflected in the numbers.

556
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,760
And that's awesome.

557
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:35,160
But can Europe start running a WorldCon every three years instead of every five years?

558
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,560
Every, right?

559
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,040
There are rumors.

560
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,900
14, 17 and 19.

561
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:47,600
So Sweden, so if Scandinavia, sorry, the Nordic countries could take a WorldCon every five years,

562
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,000
as well as the UK and Ireland taking one every five years.

563
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,440
But I don't think there's been any noise from Scandinavia to want to do that.

564
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,380
But I think there are people like Poland.

565
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,620
I know some Polish fans who maybe are interested.

566
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:05,180
Vince Dougherty at the last SmofCon said there might be a group from the Netherlands.

567
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,420
So I think there's a lot of hope on the horizon.

568
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,340
But we just need to kind of get through this rough patch and provide people the support they need to

569
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,620
make those future bids happen.

570
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,040
Yeah, I think the Netherlands and Poland were the two I was thinking of.

571
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,000
France has been sort of bidding and cancelling and bidding and cancelling.

572
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,060
But I believe it when I see it just because they have flip-flopped so many times now that

573
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,960
I'm not sure whether there's actually a critical mass there, although I would love there to be.

574
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,900
I keep poking Germany.

575
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,720
I've just now got this image of you flying to Berlin and just poking again,

576
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,200
just poking inanimate objects.

577
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,000
But yes.

578
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,180
I didn't put it in the show notes because we've got so much, but I have just come back

579
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:54,620
from Eurocon and Eurocon had 600 people in a place that you cannot get to other than buy

580
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,940
six-hour ferries from other places that's quite inconvenient to get to.

581
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,660
And yes, obviously, the majority of people there were Swedes and Finns.

582
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,020
But there were people from other places in Europe and also some people from the US.

583
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:13,060
And I think MetropolCons, which is next year's Eurocon, has quite a following behind it.

584
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:23,640
And then the Lisbon Convention is the 27-27 Eurocon, is actually coming out of a very long-standing

585
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,700
science fiction convention in Portugal.

586
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,360
So I'm hoping that what we're starting to see is that kind of European, fairly heavyweight

587
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:41,820
regional in the form of the Eurocon that could form a second cluster of people who would want

588
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,340
to bid Eurocon, Worldcons, and will be able to do so.

589
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:49,900
And one thing that I'd say is really important for that to happen is for Worldcon committees

590
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,160
to be making sure that they're doing some capacity building.

591
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,260
I was crunching, just for my own interest a while back, crunched a lot of numbers about

592
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,120
Worldcon committee sizes and compositions.

593
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:07,280
One of the things that was really notable about Dublin and Glasgow is that they had quite large

594
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,660
committees compared to some other cons because every division would have at least one division

595
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,260
head and at least one deputy division head.

596
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,280
And sometimes there were co-DHs or multiple DDHs.

597
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,380
So you had two or three people in all of these key positions so they could spread the work.

598
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,200
They weren't burning out and they were learning.

599
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,260
And then you see people who held those positions in Dublin go on to hold higher level positions

600
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,940
in Glasgow.

601
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:38,220
And I just feel like there's much more of a commitment to training people and doing that

602
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:38,840
capacity building.

603
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,860
And I think that's what we need to see all the Worldcon's doing.

604
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:47,440
And I would also encourage people who maybe are thinking about someday running a Worldcon

605
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,240
to volunteer at those high level positions in every Worldcon that they can.

606
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,280
Any Worldcon between now and then, right?

607
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:01,400
Get yourself in as a DDH or even just an assistant in a division so that you're getting a sense of

608
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,500
what's going to be involved.

609
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,840
It's really the only way.

610
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,520
People want, you know, have a better Conrunners guide, write it all down.

611
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,240
But the only way you can really learn to run a Worldcon is to do it.

612
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,660
I worked as an area head multiple times before I took on a DDH role.

613
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,620
And it wasn't that there weren't other people in the role.

614
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,640
And it still destroyed me for Conrunning.

615
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,000
I'm for Worldcon running.

616
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,200
Never going to do that again.

617
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:25,740
OK.

618
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,520
Anything else on Montreal?

619
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,340
I know what I'm going to be looking for is some better indication from them about who

620
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,480
the leadership of the convention will be, who the committee will be, who will be working

621
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,060
on it.

622
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:42,760
Maybe a little bit reflecting that bit that's dropped on the bottom of one of their pages

623
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,620
about rehabilitating people, right?

624
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:51,980
I just want to know more about all of that before the vote closes, hopefully sooner than

625
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:58,700
later, so that I know if I feel like I can vote for Montreal or if I feel like I need to

626
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,040
vote none of the above to protect the Worldcon.

627
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,820
Because for me, that's really what it's about.

628
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,600
It's trying to protect the Worldcon brand and make sure we're not making things worse by

629
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,340
going to Montreal.

630
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,620
Yeah, I think that's fair.

631
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,940
That all sounds great.

632
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,380
With all of that having been said, site selection is now open.

633
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,320
There is a link in the show notes.

634
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:22,360
If you are a member of Seattle, I encourage you to go and vote in site selection.

635
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:28,400
And it's worth noting that no matter who you vote for, you would become a supporting member

636
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,800
of the next Worldcon.

637
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,520
I would say know how to vote, but wait until you have information that you need to vote.

638
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,120
Yes.

639
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,180
Yes.

640
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:46,520
Shall we talk a little bit about the Seattle Business Meeting before we do picks?

641
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,780
There was one.

642
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,940
There was one.

643
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,080
And it was online.

644
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,520
It was online.

645
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,140
And it was constitutional.

646
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,660
So the first thing they did was vote on whether or not it was constitutional.

647
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,780
And that vote was passed by more than 52 to 48, I think.

648
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,780
I think it was 70% to 30%.

649
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,160
Very solid support for online.

650
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,000
But obviously, that is the people who were online.

651
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,440
But you know, that's where you go.

652
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,280
There were multiple people in the Discord said that they had joined specifically to vote that

653
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,700
it was not constitutional.

654
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,020
So I think there were people online who...

655
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:29,080
I think the group of people who did not think it was constitutional were also out in force.

656
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,700
It's just that they were smaller.

657
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,360
Quite a lot of people went.

658
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,880
168 or something.

659
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,340
Yeah.

660
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,580
So the business meeting staff said about 180 people was the maximum ever logged in.

661
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,660
Maybe unique people.

662
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,880
But yeah, consistently around 160 active in the platform.

663
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,120
Most votes had around 120 people voting.

664
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:53,360
So, you know, some people may have been abstaining or that probably included business meeting staff.

665
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,940
Now, how does that compare with physical business meetings?

666
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,420
John, have you been to many physical business meetings?

667
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:08,040
Yes, but not the entirety of one ever on account of how there's the rest of the world con happening

668
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,640
typically.

669
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:14,300
But on the Friday that the first part of the business meeting happened, there was not a

670
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,560
world con happening in my house.

671
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,520
And therefore, I was...

672
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,800
I mean, I'm not going to say glued to it.

673
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,680
Occasionally getting annoyed and snarking on an anonymous Claire.

674
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,020
Alison, to answer your question, I'd say probably there's usually about 100, 120 people maximum

675
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,940
at a business meeting, often less.

676
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,760
More like 60 or 80.

677
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,540
Obviously, it depends on the size of the world con and the contentiousness of the issues.

678
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,580
So I think definitely higher attendance.

679
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,340
The question will be, does that sustain?

680
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:45,020
Did some people turn up just to vote against it and now they're going to drop out?

681
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,620
I don't think so.

682
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,800
I think if anything, we'll see participation go up because now we're getting into the meatier

683
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,720
part of the agenda.

684
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,560
So I'm really excited and interested to see what happens.

685
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:01,280
So I could not attend because I was at the England-India T20 at the time.

686
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,960
And in fact, I have managed to double book almost all of the business meeting sessions this summer

687
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,880
because it's the summer.

688
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,180
But I've been paying attention to what happened.

689
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:14,020
And the impression I got is that as well as there's quite a lot of people there, it seemed

690
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:21,680
to be very much the same group of people who are interested and engaged in WSFUS in general.

691
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,960
Yeah, that was my perception.

692
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,360
I mean, I don't know.

693
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,140
Tammy knows that crowd better than me, possibly.

694
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,560
But I mean, it was never going to be a completely different group of people.

695
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:37,260
But I think what it meant was that everyone who was interested could go, who could go.

696
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,740
And that meant there were more.

697
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,880
Which I know seems really obvious.

698
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,480
But I think it's something that bears saying out loud because I think there are some people

699
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,800
who genuinely don't get that.

700
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,900
And it baffles me.

701
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,420
Right.

702
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:52,100
One of the key constituencies that the in-person business meeting leaves out are the people who

703
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,920
are running the convention, right?

704
00:50:53,920 --> 00:51:00,020
People who have high or even moderate level jobs at the con can't often take out three plus

705
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,600
hours a day to go to the meeting.

706
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,240
And those are some of the people who are the biggest stakeholders.

707
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:10,580
So I think we definitely did see more con runners who maybe aren't able to consistently

708
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,860
attend the meeting were able to turn up.

709
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,380
Yeah.

710
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:18,560
That was the impression I got that several people who I know have very senior roles on conventions

711
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:24,940
and bids were engaged in the bits of the discussion I saw, which weren't entirely the official

712
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,380
ones.

713
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,240
Well, there is a full recording of the first session available and linked, I think, on the

714
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,020
Seattle website.

715
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,460
So people can check that out.

716
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:39,200
I heard someone say if you run it at 2.7 times speed, it's pretty good.

717
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,760
Yeah.

718
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,520
I think Andrew January said play it faster and it's better.

719
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,900
Well, as is true of much audio.

720
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,680
Hello, John Bray, who is listening to the 3.6.

721
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:57,160
But obviously, the more audio you listen to fast, the easier it is for you.

722
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,620
So if you've never listened to audio sped up before, you might have to balance that a bit.

723
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:06,120
Meg McDonald was telling me she listens to podcasts and e-books at four times speed.

724
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,560
And I was just blown away.

725
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,920
I can't imagine it.

726
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,120
But I imagine she's like, well, I didn't do it right away.

727
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,180
I worked my way up to it.

728
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,600
Well, the next business meeting will be July 13th.

729
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,400
So I think that is after this episode comes out, right?

730
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,600
So by the time you listen to this, listeners, there will have been another one and it will

731
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,980
have been equally exciting.

732
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:32,420
And then there will be one the week after that on July 19th, I think.

733
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:38,620
So yeah, if you are a member of Seattle, if you have a Wispos membership, then you also

734
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,440
need a virtual or attending membership.

735
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,260
But if you have those things, then you can join the meeting and see how the sausage is made

736
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,440
and cast your votes and snark along with John on Anonymous Claire.

737
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,200
Yes, and get annoyed when people vote wrong, which is important in any democracy.

738
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,060
I think I will.

739
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:56,420
I will.

740
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,360
I can't do the 13th, but the 19th, I probably can get to.

741
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:05,660
And presumably that's then the third meeting and there'll be a fourth meeting if necessary.

742
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,460
Which I'm pretty sure there will be.

743
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,060
There's a lot of business.

744
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,160
Yeah, the fourth meeting is scheduled for the 25th of July.

745
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,520
And I'm doing something quite cool that night, which I should probably mention, which is the

746
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:23,500
trans reading of Twelfth Night, which is sold out in person, but you can still get an online

747
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,820
ticket for, I believe.

748
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,860
That has got into the news.

749
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:30,440
Doug Spencer is involved in this and he was the one who put us all onto it.

750
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,160
But it's going to have high profile people, including Ian McKellen, doing part of the reading.

751
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,780
So I'll do the introduction and I'll try and find a show note link for you to that.

752
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,660
But that's I think clashes with the Wispos business meeting.

753
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,160
Sorry, guys.

754
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,000
But that third one I can get to.

755
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,400
So one out of four is bad, right?

756
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,540
I'm sorry.

757
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,980
So why worry about the online business meetings?

758
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,540
They may start to expand to fill more space.

759
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,740
And I think if this is something that WorldCons pick up generally, it's a risk.

760
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,860
Why do you think that's happening anyway?

761
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:09,600
Yeah, I think there's a this is kind of the subject for another podcast, but there are other

762
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,240
reasons why business is expanding to fill the space.

763
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,980
So we've obviously had a lot of stuff going on that's causing a lot of business.

764
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,600
And then I think there are these pressures to add more and more business.

765
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,220
That's why I think the work of the business meeting study group is really, really important.

766
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,420
There are lots of things that we're doing in the business meeting that don't need to be done live.

767
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,980
I think there are some also some really legitimate complaints about the way the meetings were

768
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:36,280
scheduled, whether there was consultation about what scheduling would work better or worse for

769
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,400
people who wanted to attend.

770
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:44,940
I think there are other ways to think about using even doing a virtual meeting and how to

771
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,480
schedule it something more intense over a smaller number of days.

772
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,920
There's lots of different options.

773
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,260
And I think now that we've had one virtual meeting this year for Seattle and probably another

774
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:01,080
next year, knowing that Jesse is the business meeting chair for next year as well.

775
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:06,260
Hopefully, we'll start to see maybe a little more experimentation and combine that with the

776
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:11,220
business meeting study group to hopefully get things tighter instead of having them keep

777
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:11,480
grow.

778
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,160
So I kind of hope, Alison, that you're wrong and that it actually goes in the other direction.

779
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,300
That would be great.

780
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,480
I hope so, too.

781
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,440
I also think like because there is a group of people for whom going to the business meeting

782
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,460
in person at the con is their fandom, right?

783
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,080
That is what they enjoy doing.

784
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,460
They're really sad about this transition to online, which I totally get.

785
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,600
And I understand that that's a loss for them.

786
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,400
But it's also not the same kind of community.

787
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,140
So even those people probably would be inclined to want to spend less time doing something that

788
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,880
doesn't quite have that same immediacy as an in-person event, right?

789
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:58,680
And also, like, if we don't have to have business meetings at the Worldcon anymore, we can run LARPs and they can achieve many of the same goals.

790
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,260
Well, did you have business meeting LARPs?

791
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,300
Yeah, exactly.

792
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,640
So, John, I'll be looking forward to your debating society LARP.

793
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:12,460
Get Ada Palmer to run her conclave LARP.

794
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,880
Yes.

795
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,500
I want, you know, I think that could be quite fun.

796
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,820
I want to be able to vote for Jessie to be the next Pope.

797
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,520
That would be awesome.

798
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,480
Yes.

799
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,780
Hmm.

800
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,300
Do we want to touch on Chris and Dave or do we want to punt that?

801
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,840
Oh, I want to touch on Chris and Dave.

802
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:46,420
So we know from previous episodes of Octothorpe that Chris Barkley sued Dave McCarty to try and get his 2023 Hugo.

803
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,240
He has then posted a very long article about his day in court.

804
00:56:51,240 --> 00:57:00,120
And I don't think I can do better than to summarise what Dave Langford said about it, which was Chris wrote 4,000 words and Dave has written the following.

805
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:05,060
In the court circular section of Ansible this month, and we'll put a link in the show notes.

806
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:16,540
Chris Barkley's legal quest to prize his 2023 Hugo Award from the sinister clutches of that year's Hugo administrator, Dave McCarty, led to a court encounter in Chicago in June 26th,

807
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:28,720
in which the judge told McCarty to deliver the trophy or fragments thereof, the bases having reportedly been damaged in transit from China, to Barkley before a further continuance hearing on the 22nd of September.

808
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,600
With characteristic charm, McCarty informed the court that he would, quote,

809
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:40,500
neither receive nor accept any emails, text messages, phone calls or any other form of communication regarding the issue.

810
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:47,980
So, I mean, I think Dave McCarty ever a charmer, as longtime listeners of this podcast will appreciate.

811
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,180
He is definitely always himself.

812
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:57,300
The one other thing I'd like to pull out of Chris Barkley's report that Dave doesn't mention, Dave Langford doesn't mention,

813
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:05,840
is that the first judge that was assigned to the case had to recuse himself because it turned out that he and Dave were bridge partners.

814
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,880
And I think this tells you something very profound about Chicago.

815
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,980
Sorry, Tammy.

816
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,460
I'm not from Chicago.

817
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,500
I did think it was actually quite a compelling read.

818
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:21,460
You know, like it did have elements of courtroom drama in the reading of it.

819
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,920
So, yeah, I mean, there's definitely a saga there.

820
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:31,400
Other actually useful pieces of information there, assuming Dave was not lying to the judge,

821
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,620
and I have no reason to think that he would do that.

822
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:41,780
You know, the statement that he has received awards, pieces of the awards or shipments of awards from China,

823
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,240
and they have continued to come broken.

824
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:50,700
And I think as a Hugo administrator, there are reasons why we often have very exacting standards for how bases can be constructed.

825
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:56,760
And I know looking at the Chengdu Hugo, I was like, oh, that's not a very stable design.

826
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,760
So I'm kind of not sure, not surprised that there have been problems in transit.

827
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,040
We have problems with the Con Zeeland Hugos, with things breaking and shipping in transit,

828
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,260
especially when you're sending stuff on container ships.

829
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,040
So I thought that was an interesting piece of factual information.

830
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,940
I don't know a huge amount about the making or management of Hugos,

831
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:21,360
but I thought my 1995 Hugo, and in fact, all of my Hugos,

832
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:26,540
can basically be unscrewed from the base so that you end up with a base,

833
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,960
which has to be packed carefully and double boxed for shipping,

834
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,660
and a very solid lump of metal, which has to be packed.

835
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,960
And it feels to me like the packing constraints of those things are different,

836
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,520
and that you probably don't want your base to remain attached to your Hugo.

837
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,580
That is what we learned with Con Zeeland.

838
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,920
We had a beautiful box that the base fit right in,

839
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,520
and it was nestled with padding and everything.

840
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,180
And even with that carefully designed shipping box for it,

841
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,340
we had problems with breakage.

842
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,460
And I don't know if they're trying to...

843
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,920
At this point, I'm sure what they're shipping to Dave are the Panda bases on their own

844
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,580
and not rockets attached to them.

845
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:14,260
I just think that there must be something about the material they're using or the design of it.

846
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,360
I mean, I can't imagine after two tries,

847
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,540
they would not have figured out a way to package them better,

848
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,940
but hopefully they will this time.

849
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:27,760
China's ever so good at shipping things, including quite fragile things.

850
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,380
And Dave needs to make sure that he gets all of the bases before the tariffs come in, right?

851
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,340
So there's a time limit.

852
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:34,840
Yeah.

853
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,180
This is why I eagerly await the next saga.

854
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:37,920
Well, no.

855
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:49,360
And like, so Chris, the one I wanted to point out is Chris asks whether or not the judgment has any ramification for other people who have not received the trophies.

856
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,160
And the judge tells him no.

857
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,860
But I do wonder, like, are there any vultures circling to wait to see what happens?

858
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:02,260
I know the Hugo Girl podcast got their rewards and they were broken when they arrived.

859
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,820
They were only quite slightly broken, I think, though.

860
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,520
And they got them and Dave was like, I'll have them back and get them mended.

861
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,460
And they were like, oh, no.

862
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:13,980
Now, they have now been fixed by, like, I think Kevin fixed them.

863
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,960
And I've seen pictures and they look pretty good.

864
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,720
It's a very lovely base.

865
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,600
They're very crafty, are the Hugo Girl team.

866
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,900
I mean, crafty in the way of doing crafts well.

867
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:30,640
They're craftsman-like or craftsperson-like rather than crafty as in Dave McCarty.

868
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,180
Rude.

869
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,160
So that is a brief interlude.

870
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:43,780
I also wanted to note that I wonder how much effort Chris put in for this to be column number 100 on Far 770.

871
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,320
Congratulations to Chris for writing 100 columns.

872
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:51,420
If they're all 4,000 words long, that means he's written 400,000 words.

873
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,120
But I assume they're not.

874
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,880
Push it in for best series, Chris.

875
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:04,220
Shall we do picks?

876
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:10,000
I'm going to pick Die by Kieran Gillen, Stephanie Hans and Clayton Cowles.

877
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,940
Die is a comic that was published between 2018 and 2021.

878
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:19,400
It was a three-time finalist for the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story or Comic.

879
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,680
And it won the British Fantasy Award.

880
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,100
And I had not read it.

881
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,040
I had read the first couple of issues and thought it was not very good.

882
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:32,360
And then I went back to it having read the role-playing game, which I very much enjoyed.

883
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,720
And yeah, it is actually fantastic.

884
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,180
So I think I might just have been hungry when I read the first issue back when I did.

885
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,480
But it is a book.

886
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,320
It's effectively role-playing game Jumanji.

887
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,820
It's a group of six kids who are pulled into a role-playing game when they start playing.

888
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:52,440
And then sort of a few years later, five of them come back out of the role-playing game.

889
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,680
And there are some news stories saying, you know, where have they been?

890
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,420
Where have they gone?

891
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:57,900
Etc.

892
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:03,860
And then they reunite as adults and they end up getting sucked back into the game.

893
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,460
And it's the story of that.

894
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:20,300
And it's effectively all of your regrets about how your life turned out from what you thought it would be when you were 16 to what it actually is when you're in your mid-40s as a 20-part comic.

895
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:24,180
Which is quite well done.

896
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,860
And there are some really poignant bits.

897
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:35,620
It's got Gillen's kind of trademark Gillen-ness, which isn't a good way of putting it.

898
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:41,320
But like he's clearly thought very meticulously about how everything's going to work.

899
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,040
And it's all mapped out very well.

900
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:48,140
There's an awful lot of kind of pathos, I think.

901
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,100
And I just really enjoyed it.

902
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:54,860
The art also by Stephanie Hans is absolutely gorgeous.

903
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,860
Very, very un-comic-like in many ways.

904
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:01,480
It's all sort of beautifully painted with a limited colour palette.

905
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:11,180
But arguably the best bit of the comic is the non-fiction essays at the end in which Gillen kind of ruminates on what games are and interviews other people about what they think games might be.

906
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,260
And that is really good.

907
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,580
So I highly recommend it.

908
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,960
And I'm glad I finally got to read it.

909
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,640
And what is a good way to read it if we want to?

910
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,140
Do we have to buy a very large quantity of stuff?

911
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:27,280
Or is it available through a comic streaming service of some kind?

912
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,300
Or is there a modestly priced giant volume or something?

913
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:38,260
I would say that the giant volume is not particularly modestly priced.

914
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,640
It is £42.

915
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:46,440
Which I would say is probably worth it because it is 20 comics and it's a weighty tome.

916
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,500
But it's not cheap.

917
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,540
But it is very beautiful and it does look very good on my shelf.

918
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:57,880
You can buy an e-book version of it which will set you back a mere £35.

919
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,540
And also I think might only be on Kindle because of the whole comiXology thing.

920
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:06,340
Although I'll have a rummage listeners and I'll put links in the show notes.

921
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:10,540
Also on the spine it conspicuously says Die Book 1.

922
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:14,120
Which leads me to believe there might one day be a book 2.

923
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,380
And I would be down for that.

924
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:20,720
But the thing that made me want to go back to the comic was I listened to the My First Dungeon playthrough of Die.

925
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:25,600
Where they did an actual play and they bookend all of their actual plays with interviews with the designer.

926
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,880
The first one kind of the designer giving the GM tips about what to do.

927
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,980
And the second one the designer ruminating on how the actual play went and what they liked about it and stuff.

928
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,040
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes as well.

929
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,260
So my pick.

930
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:43,700
As long time listeners will know I went to Sci-Fi London for the first time just before going on holiday.

931
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,540
And it was fabulous.

932
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,760
I had such a good time.

933
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,120
And I saw a bunch of movies and I'm going to talk about two pretty briefly.

934
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:55,700
The first is After Us The Flood which is a Finnish movie.

935
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:00,320
And it is about a world in which climate change has got a whole lot worse.

936
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:08,160
We meet a Henrik who is a brilliant young physicist who develops a system that could sort this out.

937
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,420
But it ends up being a profit making thing.

938
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,160
Nothing is better.

939
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:21,640
And so he and his co-researcher are sent back in time to re-inhabit their bodies and do a better job of it the next time.

940
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,340
Things go wrong.

941
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,760
And I think that's probably about as much as I want to say.

942
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,220
The trip back in time doesn't work out quite the way they expect.

943
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,300
I really like this movie.

944
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,080
It's very charming.

945
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,760
And it did not go in the directions I expected it to in lots of ways.

946
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,260
And so that was the first one that I wanted to mention.

947
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:47,240
And the second one I wanted to mention from Sci-Fi London was We Are Aliens which is a Japanese movie in which tribbles.

948
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,920
No, plush aliens.

949
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:55,060
So if you imagine an alien that looks a little bit like the cover on a toilet roll but with eyes and feet.

950
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:56,060
I don't know.

951
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,100
A cover on a toilet roll in the 70s.

952
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,420
Maybe this is not a reference that is going to resonate for either of you two.

953
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,680
In Northern England or Scotland.

954
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:10,320
Anyway, small furry aliens and they are intending to destroy Earth.

955
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:15,660
And they come and meet and spend time with a variety of different humans.

956
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:23,320
And I really enjoyed this movie which gave me a lot to think about about what it is to be charming and cute.

957
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,820
And what characteristics make beings adorable.

958
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,920
Absolutely, absolutely delightful.

959
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,020
Both of these are fairly low budget movies.

960
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,840
I think we had a couple of slightly higher budget ones.

961
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:41,400
But Sci-Fi London is basically about finding things that people that may be flying under the radar.

962
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,580
So I like both of these.

963
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,180
Pick them up if you get a chance to.

964
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,780
They'll probably both get screaming.

965
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:48,600
They both have subtitles I'm afraid.

966
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,600
One Finnish, one Japanese.

967
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,840
So that's my pick.

968
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,440
I would like to encourage you.

969
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,220
I know you don't often rate films on Letterboxd.

970
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,500
But having just looked at both of the Letterboxd pages.

971
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,620
If you think they're great I would go and give them a good old five stars.

972
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,040
Because they are struggling, bless them.

973
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,960
I know they have really poor reviews.

974
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,440
Because people are seeing them at film festivals.

975
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,360
And there aren't that many science fiction film festivals, right?

976
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,300
No, exactly.

977
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:16,120
And I've just looked at the programme for Seattle.

978
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,900
Because I was kind of hoping that some of the things that were on at Seattle were things I'd already seen.

979
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,480
But it doesn't seem like, it seems like there's no overlap.

980
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,800
So there's a lot of people out there making science fiction movies.

981
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,020
It would, yes.

982
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:31,900
I don't think every World Con needs to have like a huge film component necessarily.

983
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,180
But I do like that some do.

984
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,940
Because, yeah, there's loads of good stuff.

985
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:40,340
And a lot of it never gets anywhere that you'd be able to see it.

986
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,020
So without film festivals it's really difficult to discover a lot of this.

987
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,180
Which is sad.

988
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,200
Because some of it's really good.

989
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,360
Tammy, what is your pick?

990
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,620
I have a pick.

991
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:55,580
My pick is the Nine World Stories by Victoria Goddard.

992
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,020
So Victoria Goddard, are you familiar with these, Alison?

993
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,800
So many people tell me I must be reading.

994
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,080
Yeah, so she's a Canadian author.

995
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,960
And she's self-published.

996
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,520
Her books are available in print or e-book on her website.

997
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:13,280
And I went looking, I was trying to categorize what these books are.

998
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,340
And I went looking to confirm my sense that they were cozy.

999
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:21,400
And I found really the perfect statement in a Reddit post about it.

1000
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,100
She is quite cozy, but with big stakes and epic scope.

1001
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:32,440
And so this is a, the first book in the series is called Hands of the Empire.

1002
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,440
And it is enormous.

1003
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,640
It is a tome.

1004
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,120
And this is going to sound really dismissive.

1005
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,880
But like, think of it as good government fan fiction.

1006
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,260
I have just seen a review that says,

1007
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,520
Out Goblin Emperor is the Goblin Emperor.

1008
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:51,920
Which is the, because Goblin Emperor is like civil service competence porn.

1009
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,240
Okay, I obviously need to read that.

1010
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,480
Oh yes, you do.

1011
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:00,680
That was nominated for the Hugo in a year where I was reading things.

1012
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,940
And so I read it.

1013
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:05,620
And yeah, the Goblin Emperor by Catherine Allison is very good.

1014
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:06,580
I'll put it in the show notes.

1015
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,080
Sorry.

1016
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,420
So it has all of that stuff, right?

1017
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,300
About how bureaucracy could work for the benefit of people.

1018
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:17,000
But it's in the context of a book that is fundamentally all about relationships.

1019
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:22,140
Lots of different kinds of relationships and how they work and what's important about them.

1020
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,860
And my partner has been reading these for years.

1021
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:29,600
And he finally is like, no, you have to start reading these because I need someone to talk to about them.

1022
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,620
And he just describes them as this kind of gentle kind of fantasy, right?

1023
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:38,280
It's just, there's conflict, but it's not usually violent.

1024
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,720
And it's, they're just, they're just delightful reads.

1025
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:55,480
So the Hands of the Empire is kind of like your gateway into this enormous universe, because she then branches off into several interrelated series that take place in different times and places and then interleave with each other.

1026
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:04,600
So there's a lot of leaving breadcrumbs for things that will come up in a related book in a different series, sub series that's going to come in later.

1027
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,380
It's a mix of novels, novellas, and short stories.

1028
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,180
So lots of different things at different lengths.

1029
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:14,920
My partner has been reading them since really nearly the start of her writing.

1030
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:21,440
But now that I joined really late, like I've just been able to kind of, you know, bathe myself in Victoria Goddard.

1031
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,840
And I felt really bereft when I reached the last one that he's given me to read.

1032
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,540
So if you want to jump in, start with Hands of the Emperor.

1033
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:39,940
And then she's got a suggested reading order on her website for if you want to read them chronologically, if you want to read them the order they came out, if you want to read them within the different series.

1034
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,860
Can't say enough good things about it.

1035
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:43,020
Really, really enjoying it.

1036
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,660
Nice.

1037
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,080
That sounds awesome.

1038
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:48,620
I've put a link to the reading order in the show notes.

1039
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:55,340
Yes, Goddard must be one of my most recommended authors for the last few years.

1040
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:00,820
And it's only the fact that they're very big, long fantasy novels and it's a worry.

1041
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:06,700
Alison, this page says that the first book is 969 pages.

1042
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,000
It is enormous.

1043
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,560
But I will say the way it's written, it's like, you know, you can drop in and out a little bit.

1044
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,580
It's not that it's not compelling.

1045
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:20,360
But I was able to sort of like, I'm going to read a chunk of it while I'm on vacation.

1046
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,080
And then my next vacation, I'll read another chunk of it, that sort of thing.

1047
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,560
The other thing I will say about Victoria Goddard is that she's a wonderful person.

1048
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,360
I actually had the opportunity to meet her because my partner was running a conference on democracy.

1049
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:39,360
And he invited her along with some other science fiction authors because it's about reimagining democracy.

1050
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:45,880
So he likes to invite science fiction authors because they think about what worlds could be, right?

1051
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,620
And so he invited her and she was absolutely delightful.

1052
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,380
Nice.

1053
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,340
That sounds great.

1054
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:55,960
I also haven't read any of her stuff, but I will keep an eye out.

1055
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:59,620
Well, thank you very much, Tammy, for being a lovely stunt, Liz.

1056
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,560
Yes.

1057
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,300
Thanks for having me on.

1058
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,420
I hope it was okay.

1059
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,900
So, yeah.

1060
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:05,820
Thank you very much for coming.

1061
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,080
And where can people find you on the internet?

1062
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,080
You can find me.

1063
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:10,940
That's a good question.

1064
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,660
I wasn't prepared to answer that question, John.

1065
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:15,100
Have you ever heard of a podcast, Tammy?

1066
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:19,680
I've asked other people that question so many times and I just totally wasn't ready for it.

1067
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:25,720
When you asked me on your podcast, foreshadowing, I just, yeah, no, same thing.

1068
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,760
Just like, oh, yeah, no, I should have expected that question.

1069
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,300
And yet, completely unprepared.

1070
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,400
Yes.

1071
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:31,880
Sorry.

1072
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,820
So I do also have a podcast.

1073
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:35,780
It's called My Tiny Bottles.

1074
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:40,420
And it is a podcast where I'm exploring my grandmother's collection of miniature liquor bottles

1075
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:44,000
that she collected from the late 70s to the early 2000s.

1076
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,900
I do reveal videos.

1077
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,320
It's a video and a podcast.

1078
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,060
And I do reveal videos and I talk about them.

1079
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,880
And then I taste them eventually with people like John.

1080
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,920
John and I tasted some Goldschlager.

1081
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,480
So, yeah, you can check that out.

1082
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,240
It's at mytinybottles.com.

1083
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:03,120
And that'll get you to the video, the website, the blog, and the podcast links are all there, too.

1084
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:03,680
Brilliant.

1085
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,180
Yes, I recommend people go and check that out.

1086
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,260
With that, it's goodbye from me.

1087
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,680
And it's goodbye from me.

1088
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,260
And it's goodbye from me.

1089
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:38,400
Are we going to read all of them, all of his suggestions in number six?

1090
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:43,360
I mean, there are only 10, but it's still, it was quite a long email.

1091
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,940
We could just read the titles and not read the descriptions.

1092
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:49,720
I will note that Neil has a blog.

1093
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,380
So, he could make these recommendations on his blog.

1094
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:58,700
I'm going to say, Neil has actually sent us a perfectly cromulent blog post here.

1095
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,700
Yeah.

1096
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:05,760
