1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,820
Please continue while I retrieve my Allen keys and fix this sagging microphone stand.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,240
Fair enough.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:17,340
That was the wrong size Allen key and it's now dropped down a bit more.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,220
So I'll be back in one minute with a bigger Allen key.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:42,900
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 137th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom,

6
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:52,260
which is arriving in the club to a susurrus as people note its return and will be coming to you on the 19th of June 2025.

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,460
I am John Coxon.

8
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,020
I'm Alison Scott.

9
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,200
And I'm Liz Batty.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,440
John, can you play a bit of the and or club mix under that intro or will we get done for copyright?

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
Let me consult the lawyers.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,440
The lawyers say they don't exist and we'll definitely lose to Disney.

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,640
Hmm. Fair, fair.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,420
Yeah, yeah. Don't mess with the mouse.

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,320
We will put in the club mix or the hour of more mothma dancing because it is a certified banger.

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,860
And just imagine that's playing or play it yourself through your headphones while you listen.

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,360
Yes, that is our recommendation for this episode.

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,480
It will lead to this feeling much more high octane than usual.

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,540
And we have some layers of comment, listeners.

20
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:41,620
We heard from Jake Sellabrookins who sent us a lovely little mp3 with some ruminations on the pronunciation of wussfuss.

21
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,520
And, well, I'll let Casella take it away.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,740
John, Alison, Liz, hello.

23
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,600
This is Casella from A Meal of Thorns and the Ancillary Review.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,480
I've been enjoying all eight of your thorps lately.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,860
I thought I knew how to pronounce the acronym for the World Science Fiction Society.

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,280
But after saying it a few dozen times, I'm less and less sure.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:14,200
There are regional vowel dialect choices warring invisibly within me.

28
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,280
Wissfuss.

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,300
Wissfuss.

30
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,160
Wissfuss.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,100
I think Wissfuss.

32
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,820
Wissfuss.

33
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,960
Yeah, Wiss...

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,360
Wiss...

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,160
No, Wissfuss.

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,780
Mm.

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,160
And then we also heard from Ange who gave us the Scouse version.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,860
Here's your Scouse pronunciation.

39
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,800
Wissfuss.

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,900
And what I want to know is where were all the rest of you?

41
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,300
But well done to those two for writing in.

42
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,200
We appreciate it.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,840
It's actually quite nice to hear the voices of the listeners.

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,660
Yes.

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,360
I don't think I want you to send us MP3s all the time.

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,940
Otherwise, well, I mean, maybe we should get everyone to send us MP3s.

47
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,900
And one week we'll just put together an episode which is listen to MP3s.

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,780
And we won't have to do anything.

49
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,100
But it is nice to hear from people occasionally.

50
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,520
We also had Neil Harrison record Andy Openshaw saying Wissfuss.

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,240
And I will insert that recording here.

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,440
Wissfuss.

53
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,540
But Andy messaged me the day after.

54
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,820
So Andy hadn't listened to the podcast at this point.

55
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,160
So he thought Neil was just being very extra.

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,080
And that was very funny to watch.

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,940
But also Andy writes, please note, I'm from County Durham and I'm not a Geordie.

58
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,040
We regret the error.

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
Oh.

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:28,360
I just I have a very I have a very favourite folk singer who's called Jeslow, who is from

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,940
County Durham and actually talks about himself as a Geordie all of the time and is kind of.

62
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,200
Does he live in London?

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,560
Very much not.

64
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,400
Where does he live?

65
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,340
Well, in a bus.

66
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,840
He's a or in a van.

67
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,320
He's a working folk musician.

68
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,880
He's a folk singer.

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,120
He's not earning the big bucks, John.

70
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,340
Oh, no.

71
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,940
I mean, he lives.

72
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,620
I don't know where he lives exactly.

73
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,200
But you should look out for him because he's amazing.

74
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,780
I mean, he's really, really, really good.

75
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,860
I wonder.

76
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,700
I guess the reason I asked was because I wonder whether there's a thing where if you don't

77
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,000
live in Newcastle and you're from County Durham, you might call yourself a Geordie.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But if you live in Newcastle or you're from County Durham, you might draw the line differently.

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,900
So I think that might be.

81
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,960
I think he may be a Geordie on stage.

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,580
He's certainly a professional Geordie, right?

83
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,400
Brilliant episode title.

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,840
I will put a link to the music of Jez Lowe because I love it.

85
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,440
All right.

86
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,920
I have also seen Jez Lowe, weirdly, where mine and Alison's musical taste have overlapped and

87
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,380
he is extremely.

88
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,660
I would have said he was extremely Geordie, but now I don't want to get into the whole minefield.

89
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,940
I think I've recommended that John go and see Jez Lowe before because, I mean, I'm sure

90
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,040
he does gigs in your area quite a lot.

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,480
And he's so good.

92
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,320
But yeah, we saw him at the Chroma Folk on the Pier Festival that we went to with his band.

93
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,540
We're going to start with some letters of comment on almond croissants and we're going

94
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,600
to let Alison loose on the relevant Facebook thread.

95
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,860
Alison, do you want to pick some things out?

96
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,260
I think, in case you make clear, we're starting with some comments on almond croissants.

97
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,300
And we'll start with Nola, who said, I'd like Alison to know that I did laugh at her almond

98
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,140
croissant fantasy hero joke, despite only hearing it.

99
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,680
Goodo.

100
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,540
And also on almond croissants, David Bamford wrote to say, they listened to the episode on

101
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,680
a drive down to Androsen that if there are no almond croissants to be found when we get

102
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,760
there, we will be most upset.

103
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,140
I lived quite close to Androsen for four years.

104
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:28,420
And when I lived there, which was from 1974 to 1978, I think I can state with almost absolute

105
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,000
certainty that there was no almond croissant to be found for a considerable radius.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,260
I mean, probably could have got one in Glasgow.

107
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:42,000
Andreas de Vaux wrote to say, two Mastodon posts saying they became hungry and now crave an

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,660
episode about banoffee pie in the same detail and engagement.

109
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,780
If we ever have Stephen on the podcast as a stunt Alison, you should ask him about banoffee

110
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,100
pie.

111
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,940
Yes.

112
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,400
And also said, I did in the process find a recipe for apple pie with frangipan, which seems

113
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,180
to be the fancy French word for a tasty nutty paste.

114
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,440
Yes, it is.

115
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,460
And almond croissants have to have frangipan in the middle of them, which is part of what I

116
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,620
talked about on the episode.

117
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,720
So yes, if you are one of today's 10,000 on frangipan, Andreas, I salute you.

118
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,440
Various people bought almond croissants or lamented the fact that they could not eat at

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,460
almond croissants on Facebook.

120
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,320
Sheila last said the best almond croissant she's had is from Pret at Waverly Station.

121
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,980
And I'm here to say that there is a world of wonder out there for you because although

122
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,220
Pret's almond croissants are, I think, pretty good for chain coffee shops croissants, and

123
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,480
I will definitely have one if I am in a Pret, there are a lot better almond croissants out

124
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,360
there to be found.

125
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,480
So off you go.

126
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
I think that is that everything on almond croissants?

127
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,240
Maybe not quite.

128
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:54,600
There's one thing on almond croissants which is not in the show notes, but Andy Openshaw messaged

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:01,880
me to point out that Pink Lane Bakery, which didn't used to have a location that had seating,

130
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,540
has now opened a location with seating in Jesmond.

131
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,320
So yeah.

132
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,520
Thank you very much, Andy.

133
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,320
Oh, isn't Pink Lane the one we went to by the station in Newcastle?

134
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,680
No, that's Pink Lane Coffee.

135
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,420
Oh.

136
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,640
Pink Lane Coffee and Pink Lane Bakery are a coffee shop and a bakery on Pink Lane.

137
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Ah!

138
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,980
They are geographically coincident.

139
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,660
They are not, like, corporately coincident.

140
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,120
No.

141
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
Ah, they are not a brand.

142
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,960
Okay, so we went to Pink Lane Coffee, which does have seating, and as I recall, did a perfectly

143
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,040
adequate almond croissant.

144
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,780
But I was too, we were travelling by train along with Claire and Mark, so obviously Claire

145
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,200
had that, I must be, I must be on the train good and early.

146
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,560
I took Liz to Pink Lane Coffee and she departed for her train 15 minutes early and exited the

147
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,300
coffee shop, saw the station across the road and thought, and said to me, I may have left

148
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,660
too much time for my train, John.

149
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,920
And I was like, well, no judging, no judging.

150
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,780
That's the sort of thing we'd have done.

151
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,540
I was being picked up at the other end and so I did not want to disrupt things by getting

152
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,540
on the wrong train.

153
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,180
Yes.

154
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,200
No, it was very fair.

155
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,180
Also, I was jet-lagged.

156
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,640
It is where I usually recommend people go if they are about to get a train from Newcastle

157
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,860
on account of how it's extremely close.

158
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,720
We did also get some letters of comment that were not from, not based around almond croissants.

159
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,740
I will pick out one from Blue Sky to get us rolling.

160
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:37,260
Ed Morland writes in to say, on the subject of Magic Maze, which I mentioned last episode,

161
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,300
the red dobber of passive aggression may be the single greatest board game component in

162
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,460
the history of board game.

163
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,680
Yeah, no, I think that is a defensible statement.

164
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,920
I did watch two people trade the dobber back and forth angrily in complete silence once and

165
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,300
it was delightful.

166
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,140
You may need to explain how the dobber works in Magic Maze because I think I worked it out

167
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,980
from context.

168
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,560
Or not, if it's funnier.

169
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,700
Basically, if someone needs to do a thing and they haven't noticed they need to do a thing,

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,540
you put a red thing in front of them to tell them that they're fucking up and then they

171
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,420
have to work out what it is you mean by that.

172
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,920
Shit, I need that for Hannaby.

173
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,740
And then if two people, if two people are just trading it back and forth, it just gets

174
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,020
incredibly funny as they both get more and more frustrated.

175
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,220
And I have seen this and it is great.

176
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,140
Magic Maze is on my list of things I'm hoping to pick up in a charity shop at some point.

177
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,140
I think we should play Magic Maze.

178
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,660
I mean, it'd be a terrible podcast, but it'd be very funny.

179
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,900
Is it one of those silent ones?

180
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,580
Yeah.

181
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, next time we're in the same place, we could just record a video and stick it on YouTube.

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,980
Yeah.

183
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:48,400
So we have podcasts with no video and then we have video with no sound.

184
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,480
So there probably would be some sound, I think.

185
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
Yes.

186
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,280
Right.

187
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,340
But yes, thank you very much for writing in, Ed.

188
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,360
Should I talk about Hinkley?

189
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,460
Yes.

190
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:03,860
So last episode, I think we were talking about most remote Eastercon venues we'd had recently.

191
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,920
And we mentioned the Hinkley Eastercons, which were in the Hinkley Island Hotel, which is no

192
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,980
longer the Hinkley Island Hotel.

193
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,980
It's a jury's in or something.

194
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,960
But anyway, and Rosanna Pendleby wrote to us to say, very weird to hear Hinkley mentioned.

195
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,780
I wasn't expecting it on Octop.

196
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,720
Ah, well, you should because it's stuck in everyone's memory because of the weirdness of

197
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,100
the Hinkley Island Hotel.

198
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,140
Did have a little sort of, a little like row of shops inside the hotel.

199
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:36,080
I once saw a stand-up comic do a set and he described Hinkley as the sort of place where

200
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,720
people still point their aeroplanes.

201
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,440
Ooh.

202
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
Yeah.

203
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,880
Never been.

204
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,320
I'm sure it's lovely.

205
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,940
We also got some comments this week on Facebook.

206
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,440
We heard from Tammy Coxon, who says the 2008 site selection vote is used as a cautionary tale

207
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,000
because apparently there were more than 12 people on the Chicago Bid Committee who failed

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,780
to vote, which I did not know and makes it even more ouch, basically.

209
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,660
Yes.

210
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,320
That was great.

211
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:12,440
Tammy also leaves some comments about the evolution of the fan art and pro art Hugo categories and

212
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,420
links to her piece on File 770 on it.

213
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,500
We will link to that and I note that there may be more discussion of the art Hugos later

214
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,920
in the episode foreshadowing.

215
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,400
Yeah.

216
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,100
I think the point that she made is that some professional artists are grumpy about being

217
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:35,400
relegated to the fan artist category because the sort of way they make money from art isn't

218
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,380
the sort of way that the professional artist Hugo reflects because it is very focused on

219
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,320
art for publication.

220
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,800
And there are lots of other ways to make art these days and make money with it.

221
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,760
And I think that's a good point that I hadn't considered properly.

222
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:55,040
I still don't think it makes up for saying that all that fan artists have to only work in

223
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,140
an amateur basis, which obviously rules out many of the previous fan artist Hugos.

224
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:07,240
Presumably the thing we said last time about 25% of your income coming from your art would

225
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,860
fix this.

226
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:15,580
But Mike Scott also wrote on Facebook to point out that the early fan artist Hugos were often

227
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,640
won by pro artists for fan art they were doing in their spare time.

228
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,820
But obviously that's happened in fan writer as well.

229
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:30,060
So I assume that you could word the thing to be like if you're not getting 25% of your

230
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,420
income from the art you win for, which would probably work, but you'd need to workshop it

231
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:35,860
a little bit.

232
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,000
I think it would be better than this tack anyway.

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,660
I mean, I think there must be something around saying that fan art is open to people who've

234
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,700
done a body of unpaid work for fan art purposes.

235
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,540
Yeah.

236
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,140
But I don't know.

237
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,720
People have been arguing about this for a very long time.

238
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,360
Mm hmm.

239
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,780
Mm hmm.

240
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,840
And we're going to continue arguing about it.

241
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,220
Yeah.

242
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes.

243
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,280
Yes, we are.

244
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:05,260
We also heard on Facebook from Farrah who pointed out that our discussion of food last

245
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,620
week about food at Reconnect, the Eastercon, did talk about sandwiches a lot, which does

246
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,180
exclude people who are going to have dietary restrictions, which restrict them from eating

247
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,660
anything with gluten, which is very true.

248
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,940
I think this is partly because I really like sandwiches and I don't eat a lot of sandwiches

249
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,540
right now.

250
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,260
And so my brain automatically goes to sandwiches.

251
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,020
And also because it's what my brain thinks of as easy to move, portable food.

252
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,280
And I feel that the hotel was quite good at food you could sit down and eat, but maybe not

253
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,480
that stuff you could grab and go.

254
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,120
So we do need to have options that you can grab and go that are not based around bread.

255
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,800
Yeah.

256
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,560
I think I will say like I assume gluten free bread sandwiches would be OK for people with

257
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:46,900
celiac.

258
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,960
But there are not that many portable forms of food that are not wrapped in something that

259
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,100
you would have to make gluten free.

260
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,940
I think.

261
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
You could have like sushi rolls or something.

262
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,660
Yeah.

263
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:57,960
Sushi.

264
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,760
Great example.

265
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,500
Yes.

266
00:13:59,500 --> 00:13:59,940
True.

267
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,040
That is.

268
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,580
I think there are counter examples.

269
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,640
I guess my point being there are not lots.

270
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,320
No, there are not.

271
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,120
But I think I would like to see more like gluten free sausage rolls, gluten free sandwiches, gluten

272
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,140
free tortilla wraps.

273
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,620
All of these things I fully think should be gluten free.

274
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,020
100%.

275
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,500
I guess what I mean is when I say there should be a wide variety of sandwiches, I mean there

276
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,880
should be a wide variety of sandwiches that can be eaten by people with a range of dietary

277
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,200
preferences, not just by people who are not celiac.

278
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,100
Does that make sense?

279
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,860
But I don't think I said that last time.

280
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,720
So it's fair cop.

281
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,000
It does make sense.

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,240
But as someone who does not regularly eat the gluten free options, I have no idea if hotels

283
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,120
always provide really terrible gluten free sandwiches and therefore you prefer them to do something

284
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,580
that wasn't a sandwich.

285
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,000
So I guess I guess the question I would ask, I think would be really useful to ask.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,400
is what conventions have done this well?

287
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,980
And what did they do?

288
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,480
Because that was a point I tried to make last time, which is I'm not sure whether Belfast

289
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,860
was uniquely bad or whether conventions are just very bad at this.

290
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,000
So please tell us about the conventions that did food requirements well.

291
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,520
And please tell us what it was that they did.

292
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,160
Like, what is the actual answer?

293
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,780
Because I'd be fascinated to know as someone who does not have any of these dietary requirements.

294
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,380
As somebody who's worked on quite a lot of conventions, I think the answer may be

295
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,880
that it's not so much anything the convention does.

296
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,220
It's the thing the venue does.

297
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,680
So that no matter how much you tell and work with the venue in advance, they can still mess

298
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,660
it up on the day quite substantially.

299
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,640
I think Inominate had an excellent range of food that catered to almost everybody by having

300
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,200
indoor food court, an indoor food court system.

301
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,380
And we went back to the same hotel not that long later, and they just couldn't do it for

302
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:45,640
us.

303
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,480
I have no idea.

304
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,600
So Inominate was the 2017 Eastcon in Birmingham.

305
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,040
Birmingham also has the advantage that it has the food trucks outside.

306
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,620
But I think we discussed last time, Belfast probably couldn't have done either a food court

307
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,540
or food trucks.

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,940
Well, the food court was just the hotel's internal catering putting stalls in a conference room.

309
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,840
Yeah, it was great.

310
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,340
So any hotel could do that if they wanted to.

311
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,760
They made a packet because obviously lots of people bought food and liked it.

312
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,260
The hotel sold a lot of food profitably.

313
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,500
That's what hotels should want to do.

314
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,480
You would think.

315
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,200
I think I would also still peg 2017 as being the recent high watermark of confit.

316
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,220
It was really good.

317
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
And it was varied.

318
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,160
And it wasn't just, you know, a jacket potato with beans.

319
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,860
I think I had like a goat curry.

320
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,880
It was super spicy.

321
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,640
It was really good.

322
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,020
Goat curry was...

323
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,000
It wasn't even that spicy.

324
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,140
I mean, this also...

325
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,420
Also in 2017, this was more important because they hadn't built that giant resort world thing.

326
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,060
So you couldn't easily pop out to Nando's or whatever.

327
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,440
No, they had.

328
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, we had resort world.

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,440
We just didn't realise we had resort world until we got there because the previous time we hadn't.

330
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:04,060
Because I had a really good meal in 2017 and I wanted to go back to the restaurant, which is no longer there.

331
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,840
All right.

332
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,520
Well, we just hadn't realised it was there then.

333
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,360
Or maybe it didn't have as much stuff.

334
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
That's probably right.

335
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,500
I think it's very new.

336
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,420
Shall we leave that for the listeners and move on?

337
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,300
Yes.

338
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,560
Raj wrote in.

339
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,760
He kept looking for us in the bar at Reconnect and it was his own fault for not checking which bar we meant.

340
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,980
Sorry, Raj.

341
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,420
I think this is brought to you by the fact that we were all in Rattlebag for a lot of the time.

342
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,080
And...

343
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,640
Raj wasn't in Rattlebag.

344
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,580
And we missed you, Raj.

345
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,820
But we couldn't actually have had the entire convention at Rattlebag.

346
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,060
We did meet Raj at the Octothop meetup.

347
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,500
We did.

348
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,220
I don't know.

349
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,080
To be fair, we met Raj at least once when he was coming back from a bar somewhere else.

350
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,980
So...

351
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,540
I did watch several EastCon catch-up items and the BSFA lecture on DEI and Tolkien was his favourite.

352
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,100
He didn't love the zoom UI on phone though.

353
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,560
And he said he would like it to...

354
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,120
So, he discovered that Firefox would continue to play when the screen was off so he could listen like a podcast.

355
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,880
And he would love for just the audio to be extracted to listen like a podcast.

356
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,420
I do wonder whether...

357
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,520
I thought this for punctuation and actually because I had all of the files, I was able to do it just for me.

358
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,760
And it was really good because it meant I could just listen to them like a podcast.

359
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:24,520
Which I think is the way to listen to panels because the video very rarely adds much context, I find.

360
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,120
So, yes.

361
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,620
I don't know.

362
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,460
I think...

363
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,060
But I think I want to applaud Belfast for their excellent approach to the online components.

364
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:41,920
And I think I'm happy that EastCon's are trying to get this bit of the catch-up right before branching out.

365
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,220
I will say, in the UK, it is EDI.

366
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,580
And I am getting progressively more frustrated with the fact that everyone's calling it DEI because the US version's been in the news a lot.

367
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,600
So, yes.

368
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,400
EDI.

369
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,800
It's a very small rant.

370
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,840
But it is a rant.

371
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:07,780
So, we thought we would alert you to a couple of online events which are happening this weekend.

372
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,260
Assuming you are listening to the podcast right after it comes out.

373
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,520
And I assume you all do listen to the podcast right after it comes out.

374
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:21,020
The British Fantasy Society are holding basically a one-day showcase for the World Fantasy Con, which will be happening in the UK later this year.

375
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,020
And so, they have, I think, a free one-day online...

376
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,040
Oh, it's free for BFS members and a fiver if you are a non-member.

377
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,100
And you can sign up and attend online.

378
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,240
And they've got panels and readings and discussions with their guests.

379
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,280
And it will give you an idea of what you're going to get at World Fantasy Con.

380
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,240
So, that is happening on Saturday, the 21st of June.

381
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:50,940
And on Sunday, the 22nd of June, the BSFA and the Science Fiction Foundation are holding their joint online AGM as they usually do.

382
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,460
And that is on the 22nd of June.

383
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,620
I don't have all the details about that.

384
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:02,620
But I think if you're a BSFA or SFF member, you will have been emailed or will be about to be emailed details of how you join that.

385
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,960
Thank you very much, Liz.

386
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,480
Are you going to go to either of those things?

387
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,360
No.

388
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,240
On account of time zones.

389
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,040
The Read Our Latest News page, yes.

390
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,560
So, we'll put a link...

391
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,860
I'll put a link in the show notes to the Science Fiction Foundation one, which does give you an idea of the timings and what's going on.

392
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,080
But again, I think you have to be remembered to be linked.

393
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,300
I've got all the information in my BSFA newsletter.

394
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,960
Ah.

395
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,440
Yeah, so there's lots of interesting things going on.

396
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,400
Would you like to tell us about any of them, Alison?

397
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,460
Yeah, I mean, I thought you'd said that there was a link and it had everything.

398
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,800
So, Paul March Russell in conversation with EJ Swift.

399
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,720
A Fish and Five panel.

400
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,800
Writers from the forthcoming Fish and Five anthology discuss their work with Eugene Bacon.

401
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,300
The SFF AGM.

402
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,400
The BSFA Applied Science Fiction panel.

403
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Alan Stroud, Anna Sun, Christina Carley, Fiona Moore and Stephen Oram discussing about how science fiction can be used in different fields.

404
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,360
Reflections on the 2025 Clark shortlist.

405
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,760
I don't know who is responsible for that because no name is mentioned.

406
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,420
And then the BSFA AGM.

407
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,420
And then perhaps a bonus final feature.

408
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,660
Oh.

409
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,060
So that's quite a full day, actually.

410
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,500
That's the 22nd of June.

411
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
It's not impossible.

412
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,560
So that's quite clever that they're on two adjacent days.

413
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,900
So you can have an entire virtual weekend doing science fiction conventions if you want.

414
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:25,740
Yes.

415
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,700
Do we think it was on purpose?

416
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,460
I guess.

417
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,720
Actually, I suppose it probably was.

418
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,260
You would like to think so.

419
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,820
And it actually might have been.

420
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,560
Nice.

421
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,880
So yeah.

422
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,300
I probably won't be going to either of those.

423
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,040
But they do look cool.

424
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:49,680
And the British Fantasy Society's event has some interesting people present.

425
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,760
And sort of the program looks pretty cool.

426
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,760
It's got readings by various people, including Russell Smith, who is good.

427
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,240
And yeah.

428
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,200
Just some interesting looking panels as well.

429
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
So hurrah.

430
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,800
At the time of recording, there are 29 non-member tickets for the online convention.

431
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,880
And there are 34 BFS member tickets left.

432
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,680
I assume that this is due to Zoom number caps.

433
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,800
But I don't know.

434
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,980
So hopefully there are tickets by the time we drop the episode, listeners.

435
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,840
Our apologies if there are not.

436
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:38,180
Casella over at Ancillary Review of Books, who sent us a audio snippet earlier this very episode,

437
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:48,440
has written a very sort of detailed and very well thought out article arguing that there should be a Hugo Award for best translated work.

438
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,360
And effectively, we will link in the show notes, listeners.

439
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:59,360
And I recommend everyone go and read it because I'm sure that there will be nuances in that article that we elide.

440
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,820
Elide on the pod.

441
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:10,180
But effectively argues that a best translated work is necessary to recognize global speculative fiction.

442
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,240
And that's something we should do if we want to put the world into WorldCom.

443
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,300
And in general, I think it is very well argued.

444
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,460
I would love to see WorldCom recognize more works in translation.

445
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,260
I think that's very good.

446
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,120
I think I would want to see the translator and the author win whatever the award was,

447
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:39,400
because I think you'd want to make sure that you are recognizing the skill in the translation as well as the skill in the original text.

448
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:50,580
Casella does say basically he can see one pitfall, which is that because Hugo rules say that work can only show up in one category.

449
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,980
So he can imagine, for instance, translated novels only winning the best translated award.

450
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,420
And sort of people thinking, oh, well, you know, they won that because it's best translated, but they wouldn't have won if they were in novel.

451
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:14,800
Or the reverse, kind of a translated book being put into novel instead of into best translated work and then losing in novel where it might have won in best translated
work.

452
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:25,960
I think the obvious solution here is to make it more in the vein of the Lodestar, where it is an award that is awarded sort of coincident with the Hugos, but is not a Hugo.

453
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,320
And because that means that all of those books are still eligible in the Hugo categories.

454
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:42,240
I don't think the presence of the Lodestar indicates that Waspurs cares less about young adult fiction in much the same way that I don't think the fact that the
Astounding is the Astounding indicates that Waspurs cares less about upcoming authors.

455
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:56,580
I think it's just a recognition that these things seek to award on a slightly different set of criteria than the Hugos, which is very much kind of hard number based
definitions of things, mostly ish.

456
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,720
What do we think about this idea, peeps?

457
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:07,260
So I think you've covered the main issue, which is that we tend to try not to award Hugos for the same thing in two categories.

458
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,960
And you're going to have an uneasy split whichever way you do it.

459
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,980
So yes, it could be an extra award.

460
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:20,760
I think the other thing is whether we think there are enough Hugo voters who read sufficient fiction in translation to do a good short list.

461
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,500
I am not 100% convinced of that one.

462
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:34,960
I think just because you can list quite a lot of potential contenders in translation doesn't necessarily mean any of them will have enough critical mass or readership
to get on there.

463
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,780
I think basically this is just where Casella is more optimistic than I am about what the readership is reading.

464
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,820
I mean, I think one issue is that we know translations can get on the Hugo ballots and have got on the Hugo ballots and won.

465
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:56,360
So if these novels are not currently getting on the Hugo short list or long list at all, does that indicate that there's just not quite enough there that the readership
are reading to get on?

466
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:05,280
I mean, the solution here would be to run it as a like a trial balloon category, like best poetry and best game for a year or two years and see what you get.

467
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:15,060
I think my other objection, which is not really specific about best translation is more philosophical, is that we are never getting rid of any Hugos and we're just
getting more and more.

468
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:24,600
And I don't believe we will ever get rid of Hugo because I think as soon as anyone proposes to get rid of a Hugo, there will be enough people who really care about it that
they will show up and vote to not get rid of it.

469
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:33,920
So I think it is becoming an issue of how many awards we have and how long the award ceremonies are and how much overhead this is for conventions to manage.

470
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,520
And I just don't see us ever going down.

471
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,280
But that's not really specific to any of the actual proposed Hugos.

472
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,840
It's just my feeling that we've got a lot and I don't know what we do about that.

473
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,380
Maybe we just have lots and it's fine.

474
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,700
Yeah, I think you've basically covered all of my points between you.

475
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,020
It's really the overlap and how many Hugos do we need anyway.

476
00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:00,560
Are there other ways that we could recognise translated fiction that aren't having a special Hugo?

477
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,720
Do you mean as Worldcon or as the field in general?

478
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,520
As the field in general, I think.

479
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:13,040
And partly some of this is about having publishers looking out for the best books in other languages.

480
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,440
And it doesn't even need to be other languages.

481
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:26,260
There are plenty of great books written in English in countries other than the US and the UK that don't actually ever make it to US and UK publishers.

482
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,980
Though that is better than it used to be.

483
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,320
And I think just looking more widely for your science fiction is a good thing.

484
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,300
I agree.

485
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,700
I think so.

486
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,340
I think Casella is making a specific argument about translation.

487
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,840
I think because there are lots of books written outside Anglophone countries.

488
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:52,940
I'm reluctant to say just the US and the UK because I am reminded, for instance, that Canada also has quite a big impact on Anglophone fiction.

489
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,460
And I'm sure that Ireland, Australia and New Zealand would also want to have a vote.

490
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:11,400
I think the thing is that if you seek to recognise books written in English outside Anglophone countries, are you encouraging the sort of dynamics of that global
hegemony in the same way the Worldcon already does?

491
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:18,120
And might Casella be suggesting this because he thinks actually disrupting that dynamic might be a good thing?

492
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,560
And so I do take the point.

493
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,600
I don't think I want to see an award for best science fiction from outside an Anglophone country.

494
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,780
But I do think having an award for translated work would be cool.

495
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,280
I am curious and I have not done the research.

496
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:44,900
But I would be very curious to see how many translated works make it onto the short lists or not the short lists or the long lists for the Hugo Awards.

497
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:57,020
Like Casella gives the the numbers of non-English works that have made it to finalists for their three for best novel, two for novella, three for novelette, one for
short story, one for related work.

498
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:02,480
And so like, you know, clearly that says there's not a critical mass to get them into the traditional Hugo categories.

499
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,760
But do people like are people reading these enough that they make it onto the long lists?

500
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,900
Because if they are, then this award could work.

501
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:18,280
But if they're not, I think that the constituency might be so uneducated in this sector that it ends up not being viable at all.

502
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
And I think I'd be interested to see whether.

503
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,060
Yeah, I'd be just interested to see what that data says, basically.

504
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,320
But I think Liz's point about trial balloon is also very good.

505
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,740
Like run it for a year and see what the numbers are and see what happens.

506
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,680
You don't necessarily have to run it as a Hugo.

507
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,780
I don't know whether any Worldcon can obviously award a special award.

508
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:40,360
But I guess running it as a Hugo would make the point better than running it as not a Hugo.

509
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,080
Even if you thought in the long run running it as a Hugo was not the right way to do it.

510
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,720
That was a very convoluted point.

511
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,080
But hopefully it made sense, listeners.

512
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,580
Okay, so I know I should have made this point earlier.

513
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,160
And in my defence, I'm tired.

514
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,780
But something triggered something in my brain.

515
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:05,840
And I was reminded that the BSFA has introduced an award for best translated short work.

516
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,200
And they have done it as a juried award rather than as a public award.

517
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:19,260
And so there's nothing stopping the Worldcon having a juried award for best translated work.

518
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,200
And a juried award is probably a much better way to do it because...

519
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,660
Yeah, so how much work are juried awards, John?

520
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,860
Ah, they're fine.

521
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,160
You just read books.

522
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,620
It's great.

523
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,000
I think I would also say that there was a science fiction and fantasy translation award,

524
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,280
which I believe was juried.

525
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,580
It only lasted a few years.

526
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,580
And I'm not sure what led it to close.

527
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,980
But maybe that would be something that could be revived.

528
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,800
The problem...

529
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,020
The problem with the juried...

530
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,780
So, in order to submit a book to the Arthur C. Clarke Award,

531
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,880
you have to pay £250 to submit your book.

532
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,560
And that makes a lot of sense because the Arthur C. Clarke Award

533
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,820
firstly has a cash prize of the number of pounds equals to year.

534
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,280
And also the Arthur C. Clarke Award has been around long enough

535
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,560
that it has a cultural cachet that means you want to win one.

536
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,760
The problem with spinning up a new juried award

537
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,840
is how do you get the books to your jury?

538
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,900
And do you make them all by them themselves?

539
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,000
Which disenfranchises anyone on the jury who cannot afford to do that.

540
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,360
Do you give it some endowment?

541
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,200
And if you do, where does that come from?

542
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,460
Does it come from the Worldcon?

543
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,400
Can you persuade...

544
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,720
You might be able to persuade one Worldcon committee to do that.

545
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,400
Can you persuade enough that you get the critical mass

546
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,500
to have a juried award go forward for a long enough time?

547
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,580
You might be able to persuade our authors to submit for free.

548
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,340
Like, give us free books, we might give you an award.

549
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,120
That could work.

550
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,720
Might be the best option.

551
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,460
But there are considerations with a juried award

552
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,500
which the Hugos don't really have to think about

553
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,380
because the Hugos don't...

554
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,100
Firstly, the Hugos have the cachet already.

555
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,120
But secondly, the Hugos rely on people reading

556
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,900
sort of nominating books they've already read.

557
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,600
So you don't need to try and give everyone all of the books.

558
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,480
The Clarke...

559
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,140
Yeah, like I say,

560
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,380
you have to pay £250 and also give

561
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,400
seven hard copies of your book to the award.

562
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,440
And there will be...

563
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,380
For a new award, there will be lots of people who think,

564
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,200
I'm not going to do that.

565
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,700
And that might impact how viable it is.

566
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,040
I wonder whether it would.

567
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,060
I'd be interested in hearing about other sort of newer,

568
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,480
more junior juried awards,

569
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,100
how they do submissions and stuff.

570
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,060
Because I don't have a good view of that.

571
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,900
So if any listeners know, please write in.

572
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,760
A couple of other things to add is,

573
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,840
I did go back for the past few years

574
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,040
and do what John suggests and look in the long list

575
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,280
to see what is there in translation.

576
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,400
Love you, Les.

577
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,860
But basically everything since about 2021 is skewed

578
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,460
because of the 2023 Worldcon in China.

579
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,660
There are non-English language stories

580
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,100
and translated stories on those lists,

581
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,760
but they're almost,

582
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,860
I think they're all exclusively Chinese

583
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,740
or Chinese translations.

584
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,100
And the other thing is,

585
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,000
I had a quick look at the World Fantasy Award,

586
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,680
which has this kind of hybrid

587
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,060
voted by attendees of the World Fantasy Award

588
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,320
and also judges who can add extra nominees

589
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,160
before they vote,

590
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,000
has occasionally nominated and awarded

591
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,020
translated novels.

592
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,840
In particular, in 2006,

593
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,060
they gave it to Murakami for Kafka on the Shore.

594
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,440
They've also nominated,

595
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,460
I think, Perfume

596
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,380
and The Memory Police

597
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,300
are both in translation.

598
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,120
So they are occasionally picking out translations,

599
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,680
although I think those are all

600
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,960
kind of very popular translations

601
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,220
that a lot of people will have heard of.

602
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,380
I'd be really interested to know

603
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,560
if they came from the voters

604
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,520
or from the jury.

605
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,680
And I don't think there's any way

606
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,580
you ever find out

607
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,300
which ones kind of are jury editions

608
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,320
and which ones are voted ones.

609
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,340
But that would be really interesting.

610
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,440
So they do occasionally award that.

611
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,960
I had a quick look at the Nebulas

612
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,660
and I think there was like one

613
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,780
that I spotted.

614
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,600
This is not a very systematic,

615
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,500
I've not done a very systematic survey though.

616
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,720
So there's probably more that I don't know.

617
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,480
And sometimes in,

618
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,380
I was looking at Wikipedia

619
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,420
and they don't always credit the translators.

620
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,820
It's hard to know if there are translations,

621
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,080
but I think they,

622
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,480
yeah, they have nominated like Calvino way back.

623
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,880
Although that is in 1975

624
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
when apparently the best novel shortlist

625
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
was about 20 novels.

626
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,960
So do not remember

627
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,180
or know what was going on there.

628
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,980
But yeah,

629
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,760
I just did also want to add

630
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,540
that the Science Fiction

631
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,500
and Fantasy Translation Awards,

632
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,960
I think had some sponsorship

633
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,760
from various foundations and things.

634
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,460
They closed them

635
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,480
because they didn't have the time and energy

636
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,340
for all the people involved to run them.

637
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,140
So it wasn't financial.

638
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,160
Okay, interesting.

639
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,940
That's good to know.

640
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,240
So I'm just looking through,

641
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,620
I have just read a lot of books

642
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,320
for the Clark Award.

643
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,060
Far more, you know,

644
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,260
far more books from the wider genre

645
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,380
than I would usually read.

646
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,960
And as part of that,

647
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,700
I have read three books in translation,

648
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,660
which were Nomadland by Francesco Verso,

649
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,120
Jump Noughts by Hao Jing Fang,

650
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,700
and The Mark by Frieda Eisberg,

651
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,180
which was my pick last episode

652
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:51,800
or the episode before,

653
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,240
can't remember.

654
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,360
And so I have not read enough

655
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,580
works in translation

656
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,980
to fill my Hugo nomination ballot

657
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,880
this year.

658
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,580
and I am a Clark Award judge.

659
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,660
So I suspect I'm towards

660
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,980
one end of the bell curve

661
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,640
on how well read I am.

662
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,320
And so if I don't have enough

663
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,380
to put a bunch in

664
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,040
to other people,

665
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,340
I would say probably not.

666
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,480
And so I don't think this works

667
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,440
as a Hugo Award

668
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,760
that isn't juried

669
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,920
because I don't think people

670
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,500
have the breadth of reading.

671
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,800
But I think to test this,

672
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,780
we would need to do a trial balloon

673
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,380
because it might be that I'm wrong.

674
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,480
I would like,

675
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:31,860
I would,

676
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,900
and to be clear,

677
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,600
I would very much like to be wrong.

678
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,940
I would very much like it

679
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,740
if Wasfus generally

680
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,740
was reading lots of works

681
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,340
in translation.

682
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,740
And I think that would be great.

683
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,440
But for much the same reason

684
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
that when the first time,

685
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,120
what was the year

686
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,580
they first run the game,

687
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:44,820
Hugo?

688
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,280
It was LA Con 4, right?

689
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,560
Yeah, 2006.

690
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,760
And it didn't go.

691
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,100
Yeah.

692
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,240
And so like in 2006,

693
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,920
the Hugo Award

694
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,060
was awarded for?

695
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,940
They didn't award one in 2006

696
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
for best game.

697
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,760
Or did they try it

698
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,520
and it didn't work?

699
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,640
They trialed it.

700
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,760
I'm pretty sure they trialed it

701
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,800
and there weren't enough nominations.

702
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,640
Okay.

703
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,120
And like I was,

704
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,580
as everyone who listens to this knows,

705
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,660
I was a big booster

706
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,640
of the best game Hugo.

707
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,160
I was part of the team

708
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,680
that wrote

709
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,180
the best game Hugo proposal,

710
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,200
a relatively minor part,

711
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,380
but I did help.

712
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,520
I voted enthusiastically for it

713
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,740
every time I could vote

714
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,440
and I have nominated for it.

715
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:21,920
I mean,

716
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,060
obviously I've mostly nominated

717
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,500
board games,

718
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,020
which have made it

719
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,700
nowhere near the ballot,

720
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,500
but I've nominated,

721
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:25,960
damn it.

722
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,440
And so I'm a big fan

723
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:27,660
of that,

724
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:27,880
Hugo.

725
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,980
But in 2006,

726
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,640
it wasn't ready

727
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,000
because we hadn't done

728
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,760
the work of the intervening

729
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,120
15 to 20 years

730
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,000
of building up

731
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,680
the Worldcon's awareness

732
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,140
of games.

733
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
And Era,

734
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,740
who did that work,

735
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,120
spent years on it,

736
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,060
years and years,

737
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,480
building up that literacy

738
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,360
in the community

739
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,180
and also games developed

740
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,960
in parallel,

741
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,120
which helped a lot.

742
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,240
And so I think this is

743
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,020
a really good idea,

744
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,940
but I think it's the sort

745
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,520
of thing where I would

746
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,720
imagine it might end up

747
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,220
an award,

748
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,860
I would say the earliest

749
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,720
this is going to end up

750
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,400
being an actual award

751
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,080
is 2035,

752
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,520
because I don't think

753
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,280
it's cooked yet.

754
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,340
And I might be wrong.

755
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,280
I'd love to be wrong.

756
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,780
But if I'm not wrong,

757
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,480
the next step is to build

758
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,540
the capacity to support

759
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,120
the award.

760
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,140
And that's going to take

761
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,880
a very long time

762
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,380
and be very,

763
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,140
very arduous.

764
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,260
But I think it's work

765
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,920
worth doing.

766
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,560
Yeah.

767
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,620
I think that's,

768
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,020
yeah,

769
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,680
there might be a slightly

770
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,520
pessimistic take.

771
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,020
It's a long term optimism.

772
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,960
What do we reckon?

773
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,080
I will just say that

774
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,020
having looked up the 2006 stats,

775
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,180
it was also a very different era

776
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,740
in terms of the number of people

777
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,540
who were nominating

778
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,060
for the Hugos,

779
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,640
because it is much smaller

780
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,940
than it is even now

781
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,140
after we've had a bit of a drop off

782
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,920
in the past few years.

783
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,680
And so that could also be one reason.

784
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,120
There just wasn't the population

785
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,760
of people there

786
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,960
who were nominating in the Hugos

787
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,240
who were playing enough games.

788
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,380
Oh, you weren't saying anything.

789
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:44,720
Okay.

790
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,020
I will also say that I do think

791
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,160
that when we talk about novels

792
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,840
in translation,

793
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,820
there's kind of almost

794
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,560
two different things

795
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,740
we are talking about sometimes

796
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,900
because looking at the debate

797
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,840
around Casella's post,

798
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,500
it was kind of about

799
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,020
the very sort of literary side

800
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,620
of translation,

801
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,360
that they're coming from

802
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,520
small literary presses

803
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,580
and the things that were mentioned

804
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,060
were books from

805
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,820
small literary presses.

806
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,480
But I think we're also overlooking

807
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,320
that there is like

808
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,620
huge readership

809
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,560
for some of the sort of

810
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,260
translated,

811
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,580
like recent Chinese

812
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,940
and Japanese novels.

813
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,060
And I'm pretty sure

814
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,040
like if you'd run this

815
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,280
in the past few years,

816
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,240
it would have been

817
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,060
like a lot of the

818
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,280
translated Chinese web novels,

819
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,080
like probably

820
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,160
Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation

821
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,980
that everyone was reading

822
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,600
during COVID times.

823
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,020
So you might get

824
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,320
a very unexpected shortlist.

825
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,040
I don't think there's a way

826
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,780
you could change this.

827
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,380
If you have a juried award

828
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,420
for translated works,

829
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,220
I assume you're doing works

830
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,800
that have been translated

831
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,380
into English.

832
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Hmm.

833
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,980
I think that's the way

834
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,920
you'd have to do it.

835
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,440
If someone reads the

836
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,740
Ukrainian translation

837
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,560
of Lord of the Rings,

838
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,000
which is a new translation,

839
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,480
and like,

840
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,360
what is that?

841
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,080
Does that count?

842
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,360
Probably not.

843
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,960
But like...

844
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Well, also,

845
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,680
we had the new translation

846
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,560
of Beowulf

847
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,280
on the Hugo Ballot

848
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,000
in Best Related Work

849
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,660
a few years ago,

850
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,140
which won.

851
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,040
I mean, it was amazing.

852
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,640
It's a fantastic translation.

853
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,720
But that is a translation

854
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,080
from Old English

855
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,040
into English.

856
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,460
I wonder if Casella

857
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,300
included that

858
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,060
in his stats

859
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,900
about translations

860
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,540
reaching the finalists.

861
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,460
Yes.

862
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,140
Did he?

863
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,740
Excellent.

864
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,640
And yeah,

865
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,200
the proposal is

866
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,460
specifically for

867
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,400
translated English.

868
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,340
That makes sense.

869
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,620
I think that's the only way

870
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,140
you can do it.

871
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,060
Like, it just occurred

872
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,880
to me as a thing.

873
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,520
Yes.

874
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,660
I think...

875
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,060
I don't think we have

876
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,420
a fully educated

877
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,800
body of voters,

878
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,720
but then that's probably

879
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,020
true for some Hugos

880
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,700
we've already got.

881
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,420
So, you know.

882
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,460
Certainly Best Editor.

883
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,700
I still don't know

884
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,440
what editors do.

885
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,960
I do know they edit,

886
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,160
but I do still think

887
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,920
the best way to do it

888
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,480
would be to give

889
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,560
the editor on all

890
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,360
of the fiction awards

891
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,320
a Hugo as well

892
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,840
as the author

893
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
and recognise

894
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,640
the editors that way

895
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,100
because I think

896
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,020
it would be so much easier.

897
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,000
Yeah, anyway.

898
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,940
That's kind of why

899
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,520
I don't want to have

900
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,820
a Hugo for Best Translator.

901
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,620
Well, I mean,

902
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,260
that's...

903
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,500
We do have a lot of things

904
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,320
to say about translation

905
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,120
because that actually

906
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,000
reflects the fact

907
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,300
that science fiction

908
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,400
translation is a

909
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,740
specialised job

910
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,460
for something

911
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,100
which is already

912
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,220
a specialised job.

913
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,560
And there was...

914
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,580
There's been...

915
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,740
In regular translations,

916
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,460
there's definitely

917
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,520
examples where

918
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,360
a particular translator

919
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,540
from a language

920
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,020
has been so good

921
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,440
at rendering books

922
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,140
into English

923
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,380
that the novels

924
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,340
of that country

925
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:25,900
have become

926
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,000
much more prominent

927
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,580
for a while

928
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,920
because the translator

929
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,340
was doing

930
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,060
all the translations.

931
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,220
I don't think

932
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,840
we've had

933
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,580
a translator

934
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,820
of that quality

935
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,540
working in science fiction

936
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,040
ever.

937
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,780
And I think

938
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,720
it would be very interesting

939
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,500
if we got one.

940
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,860
Who are you thinking of

941
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,740
as the sort of

942
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,920
almost celebrity translators?

943
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,420
The two examples

944
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,980
are the people who...

945
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,560
The couple

946
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,640
whose names I forget

947
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,080
who translate

948
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,280
great Russian novels

949
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,360
and William Weaver

950
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,520
who translated

951
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,340
Umberto Eco

952
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,320
and Italo Calvino.

953
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,760
But there are more.

954
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,340
I think magical realism

955
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,020
was probably

956
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,620
significantly improved

957
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,240
by translation.

958
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,180
Do you not think

959
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,260
Ken Liu is an example?

960
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,640
I think he certainly is

961
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,400
in the science fiction

962
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,140
field.

963
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,620
He's probably the closest

964
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,280
that we have got

965
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,940
in the science fiction

966
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,520
field, yes.

967
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,620
The names that come to mind

968
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,620
are him and Anton Herr.

969
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,780
So if you want to end

970
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,440
on a quick plug,

971
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,940
Anton Herr's translation

972
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,260
of Bora Chung's

973
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:17,720
Red Sword

974
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,060
is a good book.

975
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,240
OK, readers,

976
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,480
you may know some examples

977
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,000
right in.

978
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,140
I mean listeners,

979
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,780
obviously.

980
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,640
You know.

981
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,380
But our listeners

982
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,120
are also readers.

983
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,680
Listening and reading

984
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,500
can be the same.

985
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,040
If you read an audiobook

986
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,580
you're listening.

987
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,720
We're nearly an audiobook.

988
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,840
Do you read an audiobook

989
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,480
or do you listen

990
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:34,960
to an audiobook?

991
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,140
I have heard people

992
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,860
say they read them.

993
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,020
I think that's

994
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,500
a response to the

995
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,000
audiobooks aren't real

996
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,660
book...

997
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,380
Listening to audiobooks

998
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,240
isn't real reading

999
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,080
brigade,

1000
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,140
which I have no truck

1001
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,220
with but that is

1002
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,040
why people say

1003
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,540
they are reading

1004
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,440
their audiobooks.

1005
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,400
Well it's also like

1006
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:50,800
if someone says

1007
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,500
what are you reading

1008
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:51,860
now,

1009
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,320
they don't...

1010
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,220
They're not making

1011
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,100
a value judgment

1012
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,600
on the mode in which

1013
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,300
the words are entering

1014
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,100
your brain, right?

1015
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,440
You'd think!

1016
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,680
I think that's

1017
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,160
the other thing.

1018
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,140
We don't want to have

1019
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,100
two words for

1020
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,020
ingesting book.

1021
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,080
This segues

1022
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,760
very neatly

1023
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,480
into a discussion

1024
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,620
of if we think

1025
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,500
that the Hugo Wars

1026
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,280
do not currently

1027
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
recognise

1028
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,320
the sort of

1029
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,000
beating heart

1030
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,520
of the genre

1031
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,300
and that there

1032
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:17,980
are obvious holes.

1033
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,940
Do we think

1034
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,820
best translated work

1035
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,480
is the biggest hole?

1036
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,700
That is to say

1037
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,380
I would argue

1038
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,920
before the best game

1039
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,220
Hugo,

1040
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,620
games were the

1041
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,660
biggest part

1042
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,180
of the genre

1043
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,820
that the Hugos

1044
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,560
were ignoring.

1045
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,140
Is it true

1046
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,780
that the next

1047
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,460
biggest hole

1048
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,560
is translated work

1049
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,220
or do we think

1050
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:34,820
there are others?

1051
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,420
For example,

1052
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,180
audiobooks?

1053
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,280
Well, I was

1054
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,100
looking at

1055
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,480
the proposal

1056
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,260
for an audiobook

1057
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,140
Hugo for which

1058
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,080
there is not

1059
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,960
a lot of support.

1060
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,520
I'm interested

1061
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,620
in audio formats

1062
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,240
in general

1063
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,740
because I think

1064
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,540
they're underrepresented

1065
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,180
in the Hugos

1066
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:49,720
but again,

1067
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,780
I take the point

1068
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,140
that we have

1069
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,580
quite a lot of

1070
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,260
Hugos already.

1071
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,720
At the time

1072
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,300
the argument

1073
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,200
was, well,

1074
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,440
actually you've

1075
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,560
got a real

1076
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,320
overlap problem

1077
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,920
with best novel

1078
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,000
here and if

1079
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,500
the thing that

1080
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
you're awarding

1081
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,000
is best audio

1082
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,660
performance,

1083
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:05,500
then actually

1084
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,000
you've already

1085
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,540
got space

1086
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,040
in the dramatic

1087
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,280
presentation categories

1088
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,460
for the performance.

1089
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,100
I mean,

1090
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,360
there is an implicit

1091
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,740
problem there,

1092
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,120
isn't there,

1093
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,880
that audio

1094
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,340
performances

1095
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,140
almost never,

1096
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,300
if not never,

1097
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,640
get nominated

1098
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,300
in best dramatic.

1099
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,160
Yes,

1100
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,960
and so there

1101
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,520
is an argument

1102
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:23,920
that it would

1103
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,380
be quite good

1104
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:24,840
to have something

1105
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,640
for best audio

1106
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,800
and although

1107
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,940
audiobooks were

1108
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,480
one of the things

1109
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:28,920
that triggered

1110
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,640
the discussion

1111
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,780
but I'm really

1112
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,860
interested in the,

1113
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,080
there's an awful

1114
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,960
lot of audio

1115
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,820
fiction out there.

1116
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,280
some of it

1117
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,940
is turning up

1118
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,980
in editor

1119
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,880
awards for

1120
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,440
best short

1121
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,820
form for

1122
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,380
things that

1123
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,860
are in fact

1124
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,200
edited for

1125
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,420
podcasts but

1126
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,380
professional ones.

1127
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,740
Fan casts have

1128
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,480
a space in

1129
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,500
fan casts but

1130
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:48,940
a lot of these

1131
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,380
things are not

1132
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,620
fan casts but

1133
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:50,840
you know,

1134
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,760
there's a lot

1135
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,420
of fiction being

1136
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,360
produced in audio

1137
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,540
form in our

1138
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,160
genre that is

1139
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,860
very interesting

1140
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,920
and it's just

1141
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,280
not being picked

1142
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:58,760
up anywhere.

1143
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,320
It's a great

1144
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,100
example of,

1145
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,700
you know,

1146
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,040
there doesn't

1147
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,440
have to be a

1148
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:01,840
Hugo for

1149
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,300
everything and

1150
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:02,680
indeed there are

1151
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,180
lots of gaps

1152
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,620
where there isn't

1153
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,080
a Hugo for

1154
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,340
things.

1155
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,380
I don't

1156
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:05,940
listen to any

1157
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,620
audiobooks or

1158
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,100
really any

1159
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,020
audio drama so

1160
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,880
I have no

1161
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,020
interest in

1162
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,780
extra Hugos for

1163
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,140
those things

1164
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,560
specifically.

1165
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,460
I think it's

1166
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:13,720
going to be

1167
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,560
tricky for

1168
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,360
audiobooks like

1169
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,180
you say because

1170
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,100
you're specifically

1171
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,320
rewarding the

1172
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,620
audio recording

1173
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,360
otherwise it would

1174
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,420
be in best novel

1175
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,160
or something.

1176
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,100
So that also

1177
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:23,740
runs into the

1178
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,300
double Hugo

1179
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:24,820
thing.

1180
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,000
so in the show

1181
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,580
notes listeners

1182
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,760
we've also

1183
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,460
written down

1184
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,580
best music

1185
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:29,940
and best

1186
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,780
poem as

1187
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,500
examples of

1188
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:31,920
things that

1189
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,300
have kind of

1190
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,900
been discussed.

1191
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,100
I think of

1192
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,240
poetry, music,

1193
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,180
audiobooks and

1194
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:37,940
translated works

1195
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,600
the one I'm

1196
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,440
most likely to

1197
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:39,740
read is

1198
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,660
translated works

1199
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,000
but given my

1200
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,700
earlier comments

1201
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,680
about how little

1202
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,380
of my reading

1203
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,200
is translation

1204
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,500
I don't know

1205
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,620
whether that

1206
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,620
recommends it.

1207
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,540
I don't know

1208
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,040
but like if

1209
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,980
this would act

1210
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,320
to open people's

1211
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,340
eyes to a great

1212
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,040
world of SF

1213
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,980
that is out there

1214
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,680
that would be

1215
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:56,940
cool.

1216
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,020
So I'm not

1217
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,240
inherently opposed

1218
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,020
I'm just trying to

1219
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,580
give my

1220
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,360
just trying to

1221
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,880
discuss it in a

1222
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,240
good way.

1223
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,760
Yeah I think the

1224
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,140
issue is that

1225
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,460
that argument is

1226
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,760
there for basically

1227
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,240
every small niche

1228
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,720
that we don't

1229
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,240
currently cover.

1230
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,200
I mean I read

1231
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,000
more novels in

1232
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,720
translation actually

1233
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,600
than I read

1234
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,320
poems but that's

1235
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:14,840
not necessarily

1236
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,400
an I would say

1237
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:15,900
we should have

1238
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,680
translated work and

1239
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,140
we shouldn't have

1240
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:17,440
poems.

1241
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,520
We have got

1242
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,600
best related work

1243
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,320
I think it would

1244
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:21,980
be nice to have

1245
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,140
something for best

1246
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,040
fabulous thing of

1247
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,480
the year that

1248
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,180
doesn't fit into

1249
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,380
any other category

1250
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,060
and I'm sure that

1251
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:27,740
there was some

1252
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,960
award set that

1253
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,560
has this.

1254
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,300
I can't remember

1255
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:30,980
which one it was

1256
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,180
though.

1257
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,100
Yeah there's one

1258
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:32,620
award where it's

1259
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,360
just the best

1260
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,140
thing isn't it?

1261
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,340
The Diana Jones

1262
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,860
award is for the

1263
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,160
best thing in

1264
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,560
gaming.

1265
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,440
I mean it's for

1266
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,460
excellence in

1267
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,320
gaming and so the

1268
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,680
last winner was

1269
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,120
the Union of

1270
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,820
Workers at

1271
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,180
Paizo.

1272
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,240
The one before

1273
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:47,800
that was the

1274
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,420
Coyote and

1275
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,860
Crow role

1276
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,500
playing game.

1277
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,540
The one before

1278
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,140
that was an

1279
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,040
activist called

1280
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,060
Agit George and

1281
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,740
the one before

1282
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,160
that was a

1283
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,760
publisher called

1284
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,260
Nibcard.

1285
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,140
So it has gone

1286
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,600
to a publisher,

1287
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,460
a person, a

1288
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,080
game and a

1289
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,920
union in the

1290
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,640
last four years

1291
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,840
and it is an

1292
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,360
award for best

1293
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:01,620
thing.

1294
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,220
It's usually a

1295
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:03,760
short list of

1296
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,240
three to seven

1297
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,120
nominees and then

1298
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,880
it gets released

1299
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,380
at Gen Con.

1300
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,780
And usually it

1301
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,700
attracts like

1302
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,860
interesting commentary.

1303
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,700
I think it is

1304
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,520
quite a cool

1305
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,320
award because I

1306
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,760
think it's

1307
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,480
interesting to look

1308
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:16,940
out what it

1309
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,540
has rewarded.

1310
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,440
Maybe we

1311
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:18,800
should have an

1312
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,620
Octothorpe award

1313
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,760
for best thing.

1314
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,060
Only if we can

1315
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,660
also have an

1316
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,500
Octothorpe award

1317
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,420
for best stuff.

1318
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,280
Fine, we can

1319
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,580
have two.

1320
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,000
We can have

1321
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,120
two.

1322
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,740
Distinction

1323
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,460
between things and

1324
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:28,960
stuff will be

1325
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,880
highly contested.

1326
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,140
It's very clear to

1327
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,600
me it will be in

1328
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,100
the style guide.

1329
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,540
shall we do

1330
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:41,840
picks?

1331
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,920
Yes.

1332
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,720
I am going to

1333
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,680
go first.

1334
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,480
I am going to

1335
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,340
pick a book,

1336
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:48,800
listeners.

1337
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,140
Now you may have

1338
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,100
noticed that since

1339
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,240
the Clark Award

1340
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,040
short list came out

1341
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,500
I've been picking

1342
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,420
lots of books and

1343
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,360
this will continue.

1344
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,460
I'm going to pick

1345
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,340
A Letter to the

1346
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,120
Luminous Deep by

1347
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,760
Sylvie Control.

1348
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,320
A very excellent

1349
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,560
novel with a title

1350
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,760
that I continually

1351
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,580
get wrong.

1352
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,680
It's a book

1353
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,420
the title of

1354
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,140
which confounds

1355
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,160
me because I

1356
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,020
keep wanting to

1357
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,860
call it Letters

1358
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,620
from the Luminous

1359
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,600
Deep on account

1360
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,240
of how the book

1361
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,360
contains more than

1362
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,000
one letter.

1363
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,960
And I think this

1364
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,760
is, you know,

1365
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,280
annoying.

1366
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,820
But the letters

1367
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,380
in the book are

1368
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:20,780
very good.

1369
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,240
It's an epistolary

1370
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,040
novel and I

1371
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,820
bloody love an

1372
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,720
epistolary novel

1373
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,120
listeners.

1374
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,160
And it is the

1375
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,780
siblings of two

1376
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,820
people who have

1377
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,980
gone missing in

1378
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,540
mysterious

1379
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,440
circumstances and

1380
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,140
they are trying to

1381
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:34,840
piece together

1382
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,840
their last

1383
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,300
moments and

1384
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,360
kind of get to

1385
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,140
some closure.

1386
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,640
And the novel is

1387
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,620
letters between them

1388
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,300
and then letters

1389
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,180
they have found

1390
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,580
from the two

1391
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,540
missing persons

1392
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,640
that have been

1393
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,260
written to one

1394
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:47,560
another.

1395
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,120
And it's

1396
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,060
secondary world

1397
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:50,800
science fiction

1398
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,080
in that it's

1399
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,600
not in our

1400
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,140
world but I

1401
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,880
don't think it's

1402
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,680
at all fantasy.

1403
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,260
I think everything

1404
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,000
is technology

1405
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,800
even if it's

1406
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,040
different technology

1407
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,280
to our world.

1408
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,480
So Abigail

1409
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,260
Nussbaum in

1410
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,060
Discord said that

1411
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,500
she didn't think

1412
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,100
it was cosy.

1413
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,140
I do think it's

1414
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:04,560
cosy in that

1415
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,160
in that sense

1416
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:05,860
of it feels

1417
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,640
very intimate.

1418
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,180
It feels like

1419
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,160
you're reading

1420
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,760
something very

1421
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,080
private and

1422
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:12,600
very intimate

1423
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,280
and very loving

1424
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,400
and it feels

1425
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,140
like exactly the

1426
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,760
sort of book I

1427
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,400
might take to a

1428
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,140
log cabin and

1429
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,000
read by a fire.

1430
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,960
And it's just

1431
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,420
really beautiful.

1432
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,180
I know that

1433
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,200
España also

1434
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,340
really enjoyed it

1435
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,320
and I would

1436
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,180
commend it to

1437
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,500
listeners.

1438
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,740
And I believe

1439
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,160
my two learned

1440
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,800
co-hosts have

1441
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,520
already purchased

1442
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,000
it.

1443
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,140
so when we

1444
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,820
complain about

1445
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,380
things that are

1446
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,000
called a

1447
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,020
blank a novel

1448
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,660
I was slightly

1449
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,840
put off by this

1450
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,860
novel because

1451
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,440
its title on

1452
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,180
Amazon is

1453
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,580
A Letter to the

1454
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,400
Luminous Deep

1455
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,160
The Perfect

1456
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,220
Cosy Magical

1457
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,400
Academia Read.

1458
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,500
I don't like this

1459
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,240
in the same way

1460
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,100
that I don't like

1461
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:52,840
games that

1462
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,400
say on their

1463
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,180
front cover the

1464
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,000
greatest card

1465
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,600
game of all

1466
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,060
time.

1467
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,460
I don't know if

1468
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,080
it's a perfect

1469
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,000
cosy magical

1470
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,140
academia read.

1471
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,080
I don't mind

1472
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,740
magical and

1473
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,220
academia things but

1474
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,480
I'm not fond of

1475
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,380
cosy things as we

1476
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:06,760
all know.

1477
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,080
It may not be as

1478
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,900
cosy as all that.

1479
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,580
So what I am

1480
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,200
going to say is

1481
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,820
that if you go

1482
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,100
on the website of

1483
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,940
a proper bookshop

1484
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,760
like Blackwell's

1485
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,360
it doesn't say

1486
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:15,620
this.

1487
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,300
So I think the

1488
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:16,780
problem here is

1489
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,300
Amazon.

1490
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,200
Might be.

1491
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,260
Oh this is

1492
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,120
this is I mean

1493
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,120
just just picking

1494
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:21,980
some books that I

1495
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,480
have recently

1496
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,420
looked at and

1497
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,020
may were thinking

1498
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,760
of purchasing on

1499
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,060
Amazon.

1500
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,540
The masterfully

1501
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,020
woven and

1502
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,800
breathtaking epic

1503
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,680
adult fantasy of

1504
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:29,940
cutthroat

1505
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,600
competition and

1506
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,420
imperial deceit.

1507
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,320
The gripping

1508
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,120
biopunk murder

1509
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,860
mystery sequel to

1510
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,580
The Tainted Cup.

1511
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,620
It's all over the

1512
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,200
place basically.

1513
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,640
The sweeping

1514
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,500
magical solo

1515
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,280
debut by the

1516
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,080
best-selling co-author

1517
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,620
of This Is How

1518
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,200
You Lose The Time

1519
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,420
War.

1520
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,700
Like if I did

1521
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,200
think of having a

1522
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,380
moratorium on ever

1523
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,300
purchasing any of

1524
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,000
these books that

1525
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,660
have these subtitles

1526
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,420
but I can't because

1527
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,320
I cut myself off from

1528
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,900
basically all books.

1529
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,760
1984 the new

1530
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,340
edition of the

1531
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,340
20th century's

1532
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,420
dystopian masterpiece.

1533
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,420
Even the old ones

1534
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,260
aren't immune.

1535
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,960
At the same time I

1536
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,980
was about to say but

1537
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,760
John broke in.

1538
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,900
The Lord of the

1539
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,700
Rings the classic

1540
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,580
fantasy masterpiece.

1541
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,500
Yep.

1542
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,620
So yes it's

1543
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:05,960
Amazon.

1544
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,960
Sorry publishers it

1545
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,760
wasn't you after

1546
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,100
all.

1547
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,060
Well it's because

1548
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:11,920
Amazon's always been

1549
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,680
terrible at search

1550
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,900
metadata and so

1551
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,820
people have started

1552
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,100
doing yes due to

1553
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,060
technical limitations

1554
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,920
like the one thing

1555
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,540
with online shopping

1556
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,460
is we've still not

1557
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,480
gotten great at

1558
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,400
serendipitous discovery

1559
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,100
online and that is

1560
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:27,920
what they're trying to

1561
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,360
drive.

1562
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,600
Desperately trying to

1563
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,660
drive it with any

1564
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,380
tools they're allowed

1565
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:31,800
to have.

1566
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,380
Bless them.

1567
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,720
I've started to pay

1568
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,360
a lot of attention

1569
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:37,900
to what my

1570
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,600
friends like.

1571
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,180
Yeah.

1572
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,240
So my pals

1573
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,220
recommend things and

1574
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,780
I put them on

1575
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,340
lists and when

1576
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,080
enough pals have

1577
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,060
recommended things or

1578
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,760
they've recommended

1579
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,660
them enthusiastically

1580
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,460
enough I go yeah

1581
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,160
I'll have a go at

1582
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:47,380
that.

1583
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,340
I put a lot of

1584
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,160
things on I get a

1585
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:49,680
lot of things out of

1586
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,520
the library because

1587
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,780
because pals

1588
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,560
recommend them.

1589
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,240
Some of them I

1590
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,100
even get around to

1591
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,960
reading but not this

1592
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,100
one.

1593
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:55,880
But yeah no it

1594
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,460
is it is academia.

1595
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,160
So it's tricky

1596
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,780
because I think

1597
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,580
Sylvie could throw

1598
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,420
on her website or

1599
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,000
maybe in the yes

1600
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,120
on her website she

1601
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,160
describes herself as

1602
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:07,980
a romantic fantasy

1603
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,780
author but I would

1604
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,860
have said that the

1605
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,840
book that she has

1606
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,060
written like so she

1607
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,600
has written two

1608
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,680
books both of which

1609
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,600
are in this series.

1610
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,180
I would say they

1611
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,220
are not fantasy

1612
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,180
because they do not

1613
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,080
have magic in.

1614
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,500
They have technology

1615
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,560
in a different world

1616
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,020
to ours.

1617
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,940
And so it is

1618
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,500
interesting because

1619
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:24,880
there is clearly

1620
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,960
like a blurring of

1621
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,740
genres happening

1622
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,840
there where

1623
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,320
secondary world

1624
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,140
science fiction is

1625
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,340
sufficiently rare

1626
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,980
nowadays that it's

1627
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,480
being it's being

1628
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,020
lumped into fantasy.

1629
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,820
And that's

1630
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,800
interesting to me.

1631
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,820
I mean you know

1632
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:39,520
Anne McCaffrey was

1633
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,160
always sold as

1634
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,440
fantasy right but

1635
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,000
it's clearly science

1636
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,180
fiction.

1637
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,640
But also wasn't the

1638
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,680
first one quite

1639
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,920
fantasy and then it

1640
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,000
was retrofitted

1641
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,540
later.

1642
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,640
I don't know even

1643
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,360
I'm not old enough

1644
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,060
to remember that.

1645
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,960
They're all very

1646
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,820
but I mean they all

1647
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,440
feel very much like

1648
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,340
fantasy until they

1649
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,060
properly retrofit it.

1650
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:56,980
I don't think it's

1651
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,720
unreasonable to say

1652
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,920
this book which is

1653
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,200
full of dragons in a

1654
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,460
sort of oldie worldie

1655
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,880
fantasy setting but

1656
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,540
is secretly science

1657
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,280
fiction is probably

1658
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:04,840
going to appeal to

1659
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,560
readers of fantasy.

1660
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,500
So she says she's a

1661
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,620
romantic fantasy author.

1662
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,920
Does that mean it's

1663
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,040
got smut in it?

1664
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,880
No.

1665
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,800
Oh boo.

1666
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,880
Quite like a bit of

1667
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,180
smut.

1668
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,900
I mean it's got some

1669
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,760
pretty breathless

1670
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,580
descriptions of

1671
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,040
libraries.

1672
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,760
so my pick despite the

1673
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,380
fact that I haven't

1674
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,520
actually seen it yet

1675
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,200
is Sci-Fi London

1676
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,140
2025 which is taking

1677
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,660
place from the 19th to

1678
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,280
22nd of June 2025

1679
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,240
which is I think

1680
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,260
today as you read

1681
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,520
this at the Picture

1682
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,260
House in Finnsbury

1683
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:36,660
Park.

1684
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,620
Amazing science fiction

1685
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,340
and socialising.

1686
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,620
The Picture House at

1687
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,080
Finnsbury Park fun fact

1688
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,120
was our closest decent

1689
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,280
cinema for quite a long

1690
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,740
time until our new one

1691
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,020
opened.

1692
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,520
So I am very excited

1693
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,200
about this and I

1694
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,100
haven't yet decided

1695
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,600
exactly what we are

1696
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,360
going to do and what

1697
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,460
I mean is I have to

1698
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,380
I have to negotiate

1699
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,120
with my husband but I

1700
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,960
have never actually got

1701
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,220
to Sci-Fi London

1702
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,020
though I did watch the

1703
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,880
short films when they

1704
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,600
were available online a

1705
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,680
few years ago in the

1706
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,040
pandemic.

1707
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,580
So this is this is kind

1708
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,800
of a thing for me.

1709
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,620
So hopefully I'll see a

1710
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,160
few of you there.

1711
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,160
I know that there are

1712
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,980
other Sci-Fi London

1713
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,720
fans who listen to the

1714
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,120
podcast.

1715
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,640
The no so they did

1716
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,920
Sci-Fi London did

1717
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,120
online shorts last

1718
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,760
year as well but they

1719
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,340
it has been on and

1720
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,100
off I would say.

1721
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,860
So I did it last year

1722
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,000
but it looks like this

1723
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,940
year they're not doing

1724
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,220
it.

1725
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,680
I would be interested

1726
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,880
to know what is

1727
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,520
driving that like

1728
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,140
whether it's just very

1729
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,060
technically difficult

1730
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,160
whether they keep

1731
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,180
trying but some years

1732
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,660
it doesn't come

1733
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,820
together or whether

1734
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,520
you know I don't

1735
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,080
know whether they're

1736
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,700
just kind of finding

1737
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,220
that there's not the

1738
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:42,580
demand.

1739
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,220
I don't know.

1740
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,100
It is I would like to

1741
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:45,720
get down there one

1742
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:45,960
day.

1743
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,000
I don't think it

1744
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,660
will be this year.

1745
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,540
What are you doing

1746
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,360
next weekend John?

1747
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,320
We can pick you up.

1748
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,280
The one thing I will

1749
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,180
say is and I missed

1750
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:52,900
it this year which I'm

1751
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,520
annoyed by is that the

1752
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,580
Sunderland Short Film

1753
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,520
Festival when we were

1754
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,180
watching the Sci-Fi

1755
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,960
London track a number

1756
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,740
of the films we'd

1757
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,560
already seen at the

1758
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,840
Sunderland Festival so

1759
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,560
what I might just

1760
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,540
start doing is paying

1761
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,340
a lot more attention

1762
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,320
to the Sunderland one

1763
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,340
because they had a

1764
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,360
sci-fi track and you

1765
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,580
know it's not as

1766
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,720
full featured but you

1767
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,080
do get some there

1768
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,100
was some good science

1769
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,900
fiction in that too

1770
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,800
there's just not that

1771
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,180
many there's not that

1772
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,960
many science fiction

1773
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
films out there right?

1774
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,020
Well it's clearly sort

1775
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,160
of 25 to 30 and that

1776
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,820
is more than than

1777
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,820
Sunderland showed but

1778
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,760
but yes I mean

1779
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,780
presumably it is a

1780
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,880
limited number and

1781
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,420
that's one of the

1782
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,140
reasons why that I

1783
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:32,860
mean we didn't even

1784
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:33,700
mention short film

1785
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,080
when we were

1786
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,100
discussing extra Hugo

1787
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,380
categories right?

1788
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,780
So yeah there's 10

1789
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,740
feature films and a lot

1790
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,900
of shorts so I mean

1791
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,020
basically I need to see

1792
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,860
if Stephen wants to do

1793
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,900
this because I guess I'm

1794
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,820
suspecting the answer is

1795
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,720
going to be no.

1796
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,620
You could always go on

1797
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,920
your own but yes.

1798
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,680
And I might.

1799
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,640
It's not impossible.

1800
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,400
Have you ever been to

1801
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,560
Sci-Fi London Liz?

1802
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,160
Yeah.

1803
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,980
Was it good?

1804
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,680
Yes.

1805
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,420
Day!

1806
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,060
You heard it here first

1807
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,340
listeners.

1808
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,500
I mean I haven't been

1809
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,600
probably since 2014 maybe?

1810
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,840
No there's a name I

1811
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,000
haven't heard in a long

1812
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,480
time.

1813
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,360
It was great.

1814
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,400
A man used to shoot

1815
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,180
underpants into the

1816
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,020
audience of a t-shirt

1817
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,240
canon.

1818
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,560
That does sound

1819
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:11,900
great.

1820
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,100
Okay well I will look

1821
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:13,680
out for that.

1822
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,760
If you get any

1823
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,640
underpants from a t-shirt

1824
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,280
canon Alison can I have

1825
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:17,440
them?

1826
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,060
Yes.

1827
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,720
Day!

1828
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,260
Great.

1829
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:19,920
Okay.

1830
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,180
And the reason I'm

1831
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:21,840
picking something that

1832
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,640
I haven't actually done

1833
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,600
is because I've spent

1834
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,180
all of my spare time

1835
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,840
for the last ever since

1836
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,500
we last recorded playing

1837
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,340
through Blueprints

1838
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,480
which was Liz's pick a

1839
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,700
little while ago and

1840
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,160
no don't start don't

1841
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,300
start don't don't even

1842
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,900
go there because you

1843
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,220
know it's your life you

1844
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,040
only have one life do

1845
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,580
you want to spend it

1846
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,440
all on this game?

1847
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,300
When you get to room

1848
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,300
46 which is the

1849
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,480
ostensible objective

1850
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,580
when you buy this while

1851
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,800
you buy the game you

1852
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,760
realize that that is

1853
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,440
really just the

1854
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:50,880
tutorial.

1855
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,220
Intriguing.

1856
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,160
Sorry Alison.

1857
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,740
I picked up again but

1858
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,400
now I've stopped because

1859
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,020
I got annoyed with the

1860
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,540
puzzles so yeah.

1861
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,300
I mean I've

1862
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,140
practically filled a

1863
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,340
notebook so I

1864
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:01,840
started with a

1865
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,560
notebook but I think

1866
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,260
really what you want

1867
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:03,780
is one of those

1868
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,720
leather-bound jobbies

1869
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,480
where you write in it

1870
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,240
with a lovely fountain

1871
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,540
pen.

1872
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:07,960
if you've been

1873
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,760
keeping a beautiful

1874
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,500
notebook then

1875
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,380
Blueprints would be a

1876
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,700
great reason to start

1877
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,260
using it but I have

1878
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,460
filled a very large

1879
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,380
notebook pretty well

1880
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,480
with notes and I'm

1881
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,760
getting through it.

1882
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,020
I'm still making quite

1883
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:20,800
that sort of thing

1884
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,020
yeah.

1885
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,140
Have you reached room

1886
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,600
46?

1887
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,800
Oh yeah yeah yeah

1888
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,140
long I was explaining

1889
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,660
that you reached room

1890
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,580
46 and you suddenly

1891
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,460
discover you have now

1892
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,300
finished the tutorial.

1893
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,500
How many sanctum keys

1894
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,900
have you done?

1895
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,620
All of them?

1896
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,760
Four but I think we

1897
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,620
probably shouldn't be

1898
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,760
talking about that

1899
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,320
on the podcast.

1900
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,440
That's fine okay you

1901
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,160
can bring it I don't

1902
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,880
think that's really a

1903
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,760
spoiler if we've already

1904
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,620
said look there is more

1905
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,680
stuff after you get to

1906
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,380
what you think is going

1907
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,000
to be the nominal end

1908
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,020
of the game and that is

1909
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,080
naming one thing you

1910
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,940
could do out of like

1911
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,840
77.

1912
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,400
There's a lot more

1913
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:49,800
stuff.

1914
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,700
I have a list of about

1915
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,120
35 things I'm trying to

1916
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,480
progress and then like

1917
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,420
yesterday I happened to

1918
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,440
look with the magnifying

1919
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,320
gloss it's something I'd

1920
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,420
seen on like my second

1921
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,080
run through and

1922
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,920
discovered there was a

1923
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,940
useful message in it

1924
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,880
that I did not

1925
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,000
previously know and I'm

1926
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,340
like what?

1927
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,500
What did you look at?

1928
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,380
Was it the note that

1929
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:09,840
tells you how to pay

1930
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,120
billions?

1931
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,700
Oh the thing in the

1932
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,100
security things.

1933
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,600
Oh yeah yeah yeah

1934
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,140
okay.

1935
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,400
My pick is a book and

1936
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,460
it is a book published

1937
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,680
in 2015 because despite

1938
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,900
all the Hugo nominated

1939
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,620
stuff I should be

1940
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,340
reading I've apparently

1941
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,440
gone back to reading

1942
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:26,900
all the things.

1943
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,860
It is Wilding Hall by

1944
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,240
Elizabeth Hand which is

1945
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,440
I think it's a novel not

1946
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,380
a novella but it's quite a

1947
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,400
short novel and it's in

1948
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,640
this incredibly atmospheric

1949
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,880
novel about basically

1950
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,820
members of a British folk

1951
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,480
rock band in the 1970s who

1952
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,760
go to record an album at a

1953
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,840
very remote country house

1954
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,040
and it's but it's told in

1955
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,980
that way of kind of an oral

1956
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,420
history so it's all the band

1957
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,620
members and associated

1958
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,940
hangers-on later on telling

1959
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,760
the story of what was

1960
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,820
happening that summer when

1961
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,580
they record an album and

1962
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,600
things happened under

1963
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,760
mysterious circumstances

1964
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,080
and it's all kind of tied

1965
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,980
in with like folk music

1966
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,240
and British folklore and

1967
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,160
how much of kind of folk

1968
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,160
songs are about historical

1969
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,360
folklore and tales of

1970
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,400
different folk legends.

1971
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,760
It's just really well done.

1972
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,660
I mean I am a sucker for

1973
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,500
this kind of like oral

1974
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,160
history stuff.

1975
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,260
I really liked reading like

1976
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,260
Daisy Jones and the Six

1977
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,660
which is basically Fleetwood

1978
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,840
Mack in a fictional way and

1979
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,760
this is another thing from

1980
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,720
kind of the same era but I

1981
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,060
like the kind of distance you

1982
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,260
get with everyone telling

1983
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,960
the story they remember and

1984
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,060
saying oh no no this thing

1985
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,960
that this person is sure

1986
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,620
happened we never saw that

1987
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,240
happen and and all this kind

1988
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:36,560
of stuff.

1989
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,680
I mean I guess one thing is

1990
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,340
it doesn't really tell you

1991
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,900
what's going on at the end

1992
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,200
but it's kind of such an

1993
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,820
atmospheric feeling of what's

1994
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:44,940
going on of this kind of

1995
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,900
like glorious summer young

1996
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,260
people just on the verge of

1997
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,160
like massive creative success

1998
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,580
and what they do that summer

1999
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,060
and how much of this comes from

2000
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,220
the atmosphere they were doing

2001
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,460
in all stuck in this country

2002
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,800
house together.

2003
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,080
It works really well.

2004
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,140
Anyway I enjoyed it.

2005
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,100
It sounds good.

2006
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,280
I have not read it.

2007
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,820
I've been told about this

2008
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,240
book before and went I must

2009
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:06,840
read that.

2010
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,800
For some reason I have not in

2011
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,080
fact read that but obviously

2012
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,560
it is very much in my

2013
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,200
wheelhouse.

2014
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,080
I am very interested in

2015
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,780
English folk and the way that

2016
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,320
it uses traditional music and

2017
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,880
also doesn't use traditional

2018
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,220
music.

2019
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,460
So some of the most famous

2020
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,280
bits of pieces of English

2021
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,960
folk music or modern English

2022
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,640
folk music have no connection

2023
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,660
to the tradition whatsoever

2024
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,400
and other things keep popping

2025
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,180
up and then there are some

2026
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,100
some ballads that have been

2027
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,800
massively reworked multiple

2028
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,880
times and others that nobody

2029
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,240
ever sings for often for very

2030
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,160
good reason and and all the

2031
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,500
stuff about what was collected

2032
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,500
and what was not collected which

2033
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,800
we're sort of beginning to

2034
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,420
remedy now.

2035
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,960
Fascinating stuff.

2036
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,060
I want to read this book

2037
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:52,600
novel anyway.

2038
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,260
Yay!

2039
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,560
Yes I think it's absolutely up

2040
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,000
your alley and unlike

2041
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,600
Blue Prince it will take you an

2042
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,100
afternoon.

2043
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,720
Oh I could just borrow it.

2044
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,960
I could just borrow it.

2045
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,320
Look.

2046
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,760
That was the Octothorpe

2047
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,260
Podcast and it's goodbye from

2048
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:06,520
me.

2049
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,760
It's goodbye from me.

2050
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,140
And it's goodbye from me.

2051
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:30,880
I really need to write a style

2052
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,080
guide.

2053
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,360
Do you need to write a style

2054
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,540
guide because I just keep

2055
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,980
dumping stuff into the show notes

2056
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,640
in a random way then you have to

2057
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,340
reformat it.

2058
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,060
Oh no that's not it because I

2059
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,160
don't think having a style guide

2060
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,640
would help with that so much.

2061
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,120
No.

2062
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,880
It's that I have to go to look at

2063
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,520
last episode's show notes to work

2064
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,300
out how I do the show notes and

2065
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,200
that is suboptimal.

2066
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,280
I was just going to say you still

2067
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,460
have to go and open the style guide

2068
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,840
and look at it or you could just

2069
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,840
look at last episode show notes.

2070
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,600
Yeah.

2071
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,400
Hmm.

2072
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,660
Style guides are better.

2073
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,240
Let's not have a discussion on

2074
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,260
style guides shall we?

2075
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:04,160
The theme music for this episode was

2076
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,920

Beep.
