00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 Please note, we have recused ourselves from consideration for the 2025 Hugos in the

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,520
 category of Best Fancast. I don't think we ever admit anything illegal on the podcast.

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,600
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 130th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast of Science

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,560
 Fiction and Science Fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 13th of March 2025. I'm John

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,520
 Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. And on this incredibly incandescent Saturday

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,040
 filled with sun, we have some letters of comment. We do. We got a letter of comment from Simon

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:01:00,560
 Bub who said there was a panel on the subject of cookbooks at Glasgow 2024 and the last question was

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,880
 which cookbooks would be recommended and they recommended the Game of Thrones cookbook,

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,360
 a feast device and fire which predates the TV show which apparently takes quite a lot of

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,600
 inspiration from medieval cooking and is very good. I have nothing to add to that except obviously

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,040
 for you me there's lots of hand pie recipes. We also heard from DC who says they enjoyed our

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,160
 episode of Watchdog. This is a joke which will only make sense to British people of a certain age.

13
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,440
 I'm not sure if that even includes John. No, today I learned that I am of a certain age.

14
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,720
 Yay, okay so John is old enough for this one. That gets worse and worse I can tell you.

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,040
 There was a clip going around of an interview with the actress who plays Miss Wong on severance

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,120
 because spoiler severance but being in severance was the first time she's ever used like

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,160
 an acoustic telephone. She was like how does it work? Do I just pick it up and they're on the

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,920
 other end? It's amazing. I put link buttons on it. Amazing, excellent stuff. Oh my goodness.

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,920
 Yeah, severance still good. Dave Langford wrote to us to say that he is one of several people who

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,640
 are following the podcast by reading our transcript. He said it can be a bit of a struggle. What did

21
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,880
 it lose to? Okay, it lost to standards and Z bar. Sorry Dave, the transcript isn't going to pick

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,280
 that one up properly either but obviously if you are hard of hearing it's the only game in town.

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,560
 If you are one of our listeners who reads the transcript and you can't figure out what we

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,880
 meant from the transcript then just write to us and we will let you know what we said if we can

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,680
 remember. Just as a general thing we will listen to the episode, work out what we said and update

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,040
 the transcript so that future people do not have the same problem. That probably makes a lot of sense.

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,960
 We won't just search our memories and be like oh no, I don't know and there's no way to find out.

28
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:02,080
 So did you buy any chance do that for stand on Zanzibar? Yes. Good call. I feel like for a lot of

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,600
 these if you vocalize the thing that the transcript has told you you might be able to work it out from

30
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,240
 your great knowledge of science fiction. I'm also quite surprised that the transcripting software

31
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,280
 can't manage stand on Zanzibar it will manage at that time because those are three perfectly

32
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,280
 ordinary English words so you know. I think also the other this is a bit off topic sorry but the

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,960
 other thing is that when I used to do data input for a company that was basically putting paper

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,120
 forms into an online system the other thing you can do when you're trying to work out what someone's

35
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,560
 written is if you write the same thing that's on the paper it will very often mean that you are

36
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,640
 making the shapes and then you'll be like oh they meant to write this because that's what the shapes

37
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,440
 are doing in my handwriting. So whenever I had a particularly difficult form I would just write

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,200
 it out in my own handwriting to see if that helped. Fun fact people John has lovely handwriting this

39
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,480
 might not work if your handwriting is like mine and handwriting is another thing like payphones

40
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,320
 that I am not nostalgic for at all. John do you have lovely handwriting? Yeah John has lovely handwriting.

41
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:15,920
 I have been told that I have by partners and friends but Alison but yeah all right so when we

42
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,840
 have no show art we'll just get John to write the words octa-thop in nice handwriting. Okay you're

43
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,360
 on for this episode. Okay all right thanks for volunteering with beeps. Oh we can all write octa-thop

44
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,720
 and you can guess which one is John. Oh that's a good idea. That is a good idea. You'll know

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:44,160
 which one's Alison because it's her handwriting on most of the cartoony art. Oh no. Never. I mean

46
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,800
 very occasionally but generally speaking no it's almost always a handwriting font of some kind.

47
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,840
 Last episode that was definitely not a font was it? Hang on which bit of it? The yup question

48
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,040
 mark question mark question mark 100%. Oh no that might be actually that might have been my actual

49
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,760
 handwriting. I mean the flow chart I take the point is not your handwriting but your handwriting

50
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:16,000
 has appeared on previous show arts. Yeah I do also have a handwriting font from a used to be able to buy

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 a software product that would allow you to make your own font and I have a handwriting font

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,400
 derived from that that I do still use quite often for things because it's kind of like my

53
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,640
 handwriting but toidia. Anyway that was probably a digression. Dave also says that we mentioned

54
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,400
 the Brunner Appreciation by John Nielsen Hall and Ian Watson and if you want ebooks or your actual

55
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,000
 print these also appear in the Taffree Library books Motowaid Reamer which is John and Watters

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,120
 Wisdom Ian. They're both available there and we did put the link to Motowaid Dreams in the show

57
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,480
 notes last time but I don't think we linked to Watters Wisdom so I'm quite glad to be mentioning

58
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,120
 it again now. Thank you Dave. We also heard from Christopher Jay Garcia,

59
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,760
 hi Chris. Chris compliments our little dramatic reading of his letter although Bella said you

60
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,680
 didn't sound enough like us so sorry Bella we will try and do better. We might be the wrong

61
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,520
 podcast to sound like your family though Chris I'm sorry or Bella. I think we can capture the spirit

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,960
 if not the accent. I would like on the record that I try to sound like Chris most of the time and

63
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,240
 when engaging with any issue I think what would Christopher Jay Garcia think? Well apparently he

64
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,120
 thinks slime pods are great which was from John's cookbook pick and he made a close version of it

65
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,680
 when they did the science fiction food episode of Journey Planet. He also is looking forward to

66
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,760
 the virtual meeting and says Lumi is an interesting platform there are some US groups that use it

67
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,200
 I believe it is used by the American Historical Society so that's interesting if there are like

68
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,400
 other non-profit groups already already using it. Chris also says he knows way too much about

69
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,040
 seating for the Oscars. This does not surprise me in hindsight. No I mean in hindsight no but I mean

70
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,000
 there's basically no topic we can talk about that I would be surprised if Chris popped up and said

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,720
 actually I know way too much about that. He says that the seating is a result of extreme legal

72
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,440
 wrangling and that they even start before the nominations are announced and expected winners

73
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,760
 are often in good positions because they have good lawyers. I'm just now imagining like a bunch of

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,280
 lawyers sitting around in a room trying to argue about whether a certain actor should have to sit

75
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,680
 two rows further back than they really want to. That sounds like a lot of hassle. I think there's

76
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,680
 a bit of and Mr De Niro won't be attending the Oscars unless he is in a sufficiently good position.

77
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,520
 Can't imagine if we have that for the Hugos we like no I will only attend the Hugos if I get to

78
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,440
 sit in the aisle seat of Row E. Surely Row C Liz that's the third row. I don't look like I'm too

79
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,200
 optimistic about my chances of winning. You want to look like you have the right level of humility

80
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,280
 John. So I was saying this to España when we went to an agent track off-ski reading which

81
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,560
 I'm foreshadowing for later but I was like one of the things I like about being in third row is

82
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
 it means I never have to decide when to sit because I always just sit in the third row. But there are

83
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,400
 some members of third row that treat this as if it's not some sort of moral obligation. I find this

84
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,040
 absolutely baffling. Some have said that whatever row they choose is the third row which I think is

85
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,120
 a schism in third row doctrine that I thoroughly reject. So just you know putting that out there.

86
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,200
 Do you want to do you want to know a secret? Well I'm not in the third row and have no desire

87
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
 to be but if I go somewhere now and I think where where should I sit and it's not already

88
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,880
 obvious where should I sit. I sit in the third row on the grounds that that's a

89
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,200
 crumbular place to sit. See there are there are non-third rowers that are more aligned with

90
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,720
 third row doctrine. This is an outrage we should we should be better. I don't know which third rowers

91
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,040
 who listen to this are of which schools of thought but schism schism schism is all I'm saying.

92
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,560
 Thank you to everyone who commented on Facebook and I am going to pick out from this Pat McMurry

93
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,760
 who said who looked at cover art and said before I looked at the title I thought that's a wildly

94
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:04,560
 inaccurate map of Southeast Asia. So I was quite pleased about that because I was worried that

95
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,240
 that my artwork which was obviously a deterred clip art I didn't draw the entire world

96
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:17,120
 might not be obvious so I was pleased that at least Pat spotted it and Liz thought it was obvious

97
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,000
 if you lived in Thailand. Yeah I think that's fair. Yeah I mean it's a bit like if you drew a map of

98
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,840
 the UK and left off Wales do you think you would notice? I would. Yeah it's a similar thing.

99
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,400
 But that did happen in an EU map and whoever drew the EU map didn't. So yes take your point Liz

100
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,960
 it's a very fair point. I don't know how that happened anyway. Also on Facebook we heard from

101
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:50,880
 Sheila La who said that she wanted to write to us because we didn't get many locks last episode.

102
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,360
 Thank you. And isn't going to make it to Eastcon this year but says listening, listening helps

103
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,800
 her stay feeling connected to the community and she is going to read the Ministry of Time.

104
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,840
 So yes I'm glad about that. Thank you very much for being in. And we also heard from a couple of

105
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,960
 people on flexibility and cancellations. So far I'm interested in comments saying

106
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,240
 trains have their own legislation that takes them out of consumer protections and I'll put a link

107
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,360
 in the show notes and Ivan said he has used different options of flexibility at the premier

108
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
 in travel or depending on calculations of risk and the ward and he would find it quite frustrating

109
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,840
 to find out that he paid more than someone who booked the non-cancelable room and then didn't

110
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,320
 actually get anything for the paying more. And that is an interesting part of the discussion

111
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,800
 I think which is you know if you have paid because you do want the flexibility is it fair to you.

112
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,680
 Does that imply that if that's illegal there should be a some sort of lawsuit to get refunds

113
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,840
 for the differences I don't know. Right in if you sue anyone Ivan. Ivan also said your tale carries

114
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,840
 the same tone as the weekly stories in local newspapers about people who haven't bought travel

115
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,280
 insurance asking for sympathy for those who take fewer holidays. That should get us some locks.

116
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,560
 I was going to say I feel the same way I feel a bit about like delay repay and like flight

117
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,800
 compensation which is that it seems like this is basically a bonus for people who are aware of it

118
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,440
 and able to go and find the right forms and write in and claim it and therefore a penalty to people

119
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,920
 who don't know about it. So I feel if the you know if train companies are starting to say okay

120
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,840
 you can claim delay repay and tell you about it and announcements maybe hotels should have in

121
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:36,320
 their fine print. This is a non-refundable rate except maybe you can refund it if you write as a

122
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,960
 particular letter. Now I do think you might be right there Liz I think if this is actually illegal

123
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,480
 the government should probably stop it happening. And so you know here if you're listening

124
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,760
 get us sorted. Whether that's Kia Starmer or Kia Egan I don't know but one of you sort it out.

125
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,880
 I'm never going to ask Kia Egan to sort anything out. Are we also heard from

126
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:05,280
 Ali Baker Brooks and and Rosin? So thank you very much for writing in everyone. We also have

127
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:11,040
 some follow-up from Liz going to Tokyo. Yes so if you remember last year I went to Japan and it

128
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,800
 was great and I saw a really good Peppers ghost effect and we're all very excited including Alison

129
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,880
 because Alison loves a good Peppers ghost. Oh I do. Oh yes and as a follow-up I found a YouTube

130
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,880
 video which is called Disney's Best Illusion Explained and it's essentially someone called Zach Wally

131
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,600
 who I hadn't seen the videos before but I can tell they are a big Disney fan because they're in

132
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,640
 like a massive haunted mansion themed room when they're doing their video. But anyway Zach has

133
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,600
 basically spent a lot of time looking at little videos of this Peppers ghost and made his own

134
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,840
 miniature version of the Peppers ghost and it's really cool and very cute and so you should go and

135
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,760
 take a look. It will thoroughly spoil how the solution is done but unless you are likely to go

136
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,400
 to Tokyo Disneyland right this minute and see it then I think it's worth spoiling. Yeah I since the

137
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:14,240
 last, since the episode where Liz picked that I have been to Anna and Hogg's house and I have seen

138
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,360
 the holiday pictures of which there were lots and lots and lots and I was distressed to see

139
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,000
 that Liz was not wearing her who wants to be a millionaire baseball cap which I assume she wore

140
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,800
 to all Disney based enterprises but she is wearing ears and then I got to see Anna's collection of

141
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,160
 ears which is more ears than any one person needs. Oh god I need to go and Anna and Hogg might be

142
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,080
 over I want to see all these pictures. I should explain here that I was basically firmly a non-ear

143
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,280
 wearing person on the grounds that at least in Florida they are incredibly expensive and quite

144
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,720
 uncomfortable and then in Tokyo basically some people are dressed up but not a lot of people

145
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,960
 are wearing like themed t-shirts but everyone is wearing some kind of themed ears and or hat

146
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:05,680
 and they have an amazing range and I found what I referred to as classy mini ears and bought them

147
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,920
 and did in fact wear them. Okay can we have a photo for the chapter art please?

148
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,760
 Maybe if I can find them they are quite classy they're like blue velvet. Ooh a photo of you wearing

149
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,560
 the ears obviously not a photo of you without the ears or a photo of the ears without you.

150
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,400
 But yes no it was good to see I would quite like to go and see the um I would quite like to go to

151
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,200
 Tokyo Disneyland it looked pleasantly mad in the way that the others do as well.

152
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,560
 One of the best things about that YouTube video is that the Imagineer who designed the original

153
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,920
 effect was gets in the comments and they have a bit of a love fest where he says how impressed

154
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,840
 he is with the guys model of it and the guy says oh my god I can't believe your commenting on my

155
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:58,320
 YouTube video and it's all very sweet. It's very wholesome and it's like oh what YouTube is perfect

156
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,520
 for.

157
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:13,200
 BSFA. No I got a newsletter from the BSFA telling me that they had unanimously voted to

158
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,720
 pursue charitable status so they're going to do that. Am I allowed to editorialise here?

159
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:31,520
 I mean it's never stopped you before. So they said we can get gift aid on donations which they say

160
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 oh well that might earn us a certain amount of year but it also might increase donations so that's

161
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,760
 probably quite good. In return for which they do have to submit accounts accounts to the Charity

162
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,560
 Commission and a trustees report which might be more volunteer effort than the benefit they get

163
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:53,600
 from the gift aid I'm going to suggest. That's my that's my weak editorialising here that

164
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,920
 those those former requirements are quite a lot of work and deciding what you want to do is

165
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,520
 constrain your organisation to do a ton of extra volunteer work in perpetuity is not necessarily

166
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,960
 the best possible option but there we go. They've decided to unanimously that's fine.

167
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,240
 Presumably the gift aid is not the only benefit from charitable status. They note that oversight is

168
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,800
 both a pro-andercon because basically you know there's extra volunteer effort but also it's good to

169
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,640
 be accountable I think is basically the summary. One of the pros is that directors become trustees

170
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,800
 and regular miniatures meetings command entry and trustees become legally responsible and I

171
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,720
 think this is a funny definition of the word pro with which I was previously unaware.

172
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,800
 Yeah I mean you know I remember when Tony Blair was and became prime minister and the

173
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,520
 black government was elected and one of the first things they did was increase a whole range of

174
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:52,400
 government oversight i.e oversight for the things they were doing and I'm like you've you may have

175
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,120
 forgotten that you're in power now and it's the job of the opposition to call it to account not

176
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
 you to hold yourselves to account but there we go. It's not obvious to me that a member

177
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,840
 organisation needs more accountability but if that's what they feel they need that's okay.

178
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,600
 From my perspective as someone who has been on committee of both the Biersevay and the

179
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,880
 SFF one of which is the charity of which is the Coenie Company they're both doing accounts

180
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,320
 it's not that the Biersevay are not doing accounts they just now have to do them and submit them

181
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,320
 to the charity commission rather than submitting them to not sure if they go on company's house

182
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,480
 but wherever so that doesn't seem like much extra regulation. The Biersevay directors would have

183
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,040
 responsibility for the company anyway and then they become trustees which gives them a slightly

184
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,720
 different set of responsibilities but it's not again not the whole committee it's just

185
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,520
 the directors so I don't I don't see this as particularly being that different

186
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,480
 and I can see how if you are a member of the Biersevay it might seem better that actually now

187
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,720
 there are going to be regular minited meetings because that probably should be happening anyway.

188
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,280
 Oh yes so the last line there which is we will be able to use receipts and payments which

189
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,680
 probably means as opposed to accruals which is much better suited to our activities and will

190
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,800
 make it much easier for us to recruit treasurers that's 100% true. Yeah and the bit I was likely

191
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,120
 surprised about is they say gift aid we can claim 25p for every £1 donated this could amount

192
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,600
 to as much as £250 an year they're simply saying that the Biersevay can only collect

193
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,640
 gift aid on donations can they not collect gift aid on memberships? They probably can't

194
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,440
 the membership is primarily paying for physical paper to be posted to people so no that's a service

195
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,800
 what if I have a digital membership that doesn't have anything posted to me?

196
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,120
 Good question but you are still benefiting from the magazine so they can have that

197
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,040
 argument with the charities commission but probably not but this is something that all

198
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,280
 membership organisations go through but if you give people benefits for memberships then that's

199
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,760
 not then that's not a charitable part of your work right. For example I have been in membership

200
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,800
 based charitable organisations where they ended up splitting it deciding which bit is kind of

201
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,280
 benefits to members and which bit is benefits to the charity and then being able to claim back

202
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,560
 gift aid on so I wonder if there is actually more financial benefits although there will be the

203
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,680
 issue of having to collect gift aid registration from everyone and obviously not everyone who's a

204
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,880
 member of the Biersevay can sign up for gift aid. So I'm obviously a member of camera and camera

205
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,760
 is obviously a charity and camera has never asked if they can claim gift aid from my membership

206
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,280
 dues so yeah like I said I can also have been in one organisation which did do this and

207
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,480
 they did quite a bit of diligence to make sure they were getting it right and it was some hassle

208
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,560
 but it did you know give them quite a big bonus. I do think this thing about them getting more

209
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:47,200
 donations I had a number of times when I was working that obviously I wasn't going to take a

210
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,440
 benefit from somebody speaking but you could take a donation to charity right and so they would say

211
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,000
 go come along and we will make a donation to a charity of your choice and I always pick the

212
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 science fiction foundation and one of the things about the Biersevay being a charity is that there

213
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,800
 are certain times like that there are also things like people leaving money in their will to a charity

214
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,280
 where if you're making a will you might consider making a donation to a science fiction related

215
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,680
 charity that's an option so they may find they get more donations from all of this.

216
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,680
 Yeah I mean it's also things like I'm not I mean I know the Biersevay are not going to get into the

217
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,640
 app to being booksellers but for example when I donated load books to Oxfam they took my details

218
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,840
 so they can get gift aid on the sales of those so if someone you know someone sells a load of books

219
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,520
 and then don't want to donate the money the proceeds to the Biersevay I mean they can get

220
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,640
 gift aid on that. Yeah they can. It's actually really mad how it works for charities I don't

221
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,880
 know if listeners are aware of this but technically speaking they have to offer you the money before

222
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,440
 they can treat it as a donation because otherwise it's not eligible for gift aid so I get emails from

223
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,840
 my local hospice being like we sold your books for £11.24. Do you want us to send you the £11.24

224
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,680
 or please may we have it and I'm like yes obviously you can have it and I do think that's one thing

225
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,920
 where I sort of understand why the law ended up like this but I think letting charity shops claim

226
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,120
 gift aid on I think maybe that could just be a legal loophole that gets close to some point

227
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,440
 that saves all the charities a lot of work because that just seems like make work which is good for

228
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,760
 no one. So they don't say right back and tell us if you want the money they say if we do not

229
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,920
 hear from you within 28 days we will assume it's a donation. I quite like this process though

230
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,880
 because I really do like knowing how much money the British Heart Foundation has made from selling

231
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,760
 our old crap which is a lot. I mean I'm not saying charities shouldn't be able to choose to let

232
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,080
 their donors know I just think as a legal requirement it's it can't be a good use of volunteer hours

233
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,960
 you would think. Yeah it's all done with barcodes. Yeah I mean for the BHF maybe for like a small

234
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,200
 charity shop that supports a local hospice maybe not like for Oxfam. Yeah maybe there should be some

235
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,960
 scale thing right Oxfam can do it automatically. If you have opinions on charities in the UK

236
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,760
 listeners write in. And if you're the BSFA and you're thinking of opening a second-hand bookshop

237
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,760
 let me know what about the tumbola do you think that donations at the tumbola are now gift-atable

238
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,280
 and do that in that case they have to get a form every time I give them a pound for the tumbola.

239
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,040
 Isn't tumbolaing technically illegal and so they probably don't want to make it paperwork?

240
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,320
 If that's the case then yeah they're probably not going to be kidding me on that.

241
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,880
 You could definitely do a tumbola in a legal way. It's just that for various reasons most of them

242
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,680
 don't quite fit the rules for tumbolas but I don't think anybody's paying a lot of attention.

243
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,240
 No this is one of those things where I have a confidently asserted we never talk about

244
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,000
 legal things on the pod and then I'm like I've finished tumbolas. That hive of scum and villainy.

245
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 That hive of scum and villainy which I can tell you raises a ton of money. The fanfans of course

246
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,720
 have looked very vaguely into the possibility of whether the fanfans could have charitable status

247
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,760
 which would benefit us in a couple of ways and decided it's far too much like hard work.

248
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,920
 But the fanfans are not anything formally right now are they? No they are just they are just

249
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,760
 well it's complicated because the League of Fads they all have bank accounts right and the League

250
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,920
 of Fanfans has a bank account now and has a whole pile of and now has a constitution and officers

251
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,440
 and things of that kind because we needed to move our bank account away from Lloyds and the

252
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
 new bank account requires us to have those things so we have those things.

253
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,920
 If you're an unincorporated member society in Britain and you bank with Lloyds which a lot of

254
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,360
 people do we are all moving our accounts because they're charging us lots of money.

255
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,920
 Another thing I can report from the BSFA AGM is that there is going to be a working group

256
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,040
 for the Best Translation Award and that working group involves Farah Mendelssohn, Kevin McVay

257
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,680
 and Neil Harrison who are clever people with opinions and I might also involve other people

258
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,600
 because I confess I found this out by vaguely listening to Neil in the pub and may not have been

259
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,560
 paying as much attention as I could at unreaders but yes so there's going to be a working group

260
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:09,520
 and they're going to sort it out probably. I feel it would be good to have a non-English native on

261
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,320
 that group or somebody who was familiar with the business of translation. Maybe I mean I mean do you

262
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,960
 know who was at the BSFA AGM who was there to volunteer? It might be that this is opinions from

263
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,760
 those people. It might be the plan to put out I think a call for people to send them their opinions

264
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,760
 anyway so thanks quite preliminary. John and Allison are you on any working groups of any kind?

265
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,000
 Yes I'm on the business meeting operations what is it called? Business meeting operating systems

266
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,400
 Discord which is part of a subcommittee the name of which I don't know which is looking at the

267
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,200
 business meeting and holding it remotely. It's being chaired in what I would characterize as a

268
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,160
 quite hands-off way by Farah Mendelssohn who is basically dumped us all in a Discord and just sort

269
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,600
 of let us get on with it. I have pointed out in the Discord that I saw with ADHD don't do well with

270
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,880
 free form and more do well with structure and deadlines but yeah it's going well. Most people

271
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,400
 are very concerned about how we have meetings with Roberts Rules in remote spaces and I'm like I

272
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,440
 fundamentally don't think that's the answer and last episode I talked about my opinions based on

273
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,160
 the Python community and I've worked that up a bit more now and I've called it Wepps which stand

274
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,560
 for Worldcon or WUSFS enhancement proposals after the PEPs which are Python enhancement proposals

275
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,480
 listeners and that started some discussion which sort of peated off but I think once we make it into

276
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,160
 I think the plan is for the next stage to be done more in terms of Zoom meetings and with more

277
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,960
 focused questions so I think that might be the sort of thing my brain can latch on to more

278
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:51,840
 and hopefully I'll be a bit more able to contribute in that mode but yeah it's fun so far and I

279
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,680
 disagree with a lot of the people on the Discord but that's all right that's that's all good and

280
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,840
 healthy probably I hope I hope none of them hate me. I've volunteered to help far a little bit with

281
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:09,360
 the process and we are meeting tomorrow in fact to talk about next stages and indeed we're going

282
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,440
 to break into a number of small subgroups and the plan is to have some Zoom meetings and hopefully

283
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,680
 if there are people out there who are on this group but have been put off by Discord they'll get

284
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,240
 engaged with Zoom so it should get a range of voices in there and hopefully some good stuff will come

285
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,880
 out of it it's quite hard to see how it's going to all come together at the moment and I think

286
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,400
 that's one of the things I'm going to be talking to far about. I like structure a lot more than

287
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,320
 many people do which is I recognize because of my neurodivergence. Because there aren't any other

288
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,480
 neurodivergent people A in fandom generally or B on this subgroup. Well but I think it's important

289
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,680
 to say that I guess I recognize it is I don't mean it's because of neurodivergence I mean it's because

290
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:59,760
 of my neurodivergence and I'm being very specific that I mean my neurodivergent in this case because

291
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,720
 not all neurodivergent people need the same adjustments. So I think one of the crucial things

292
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,440
 in this committee is that it does report back with something even if the something is we have had

293
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,280
 these discussions so far and we're going to keep at it for another year because I think there is a

294
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,640
 bit of committees are where things go to die if the business meeting doesn't want to discuss them

295
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,400
 I'm going to need to kind of get over that and so having a committee that actually comes back

296
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,360
 with proposals and stuff would be good although I think there have been a few recently that have

297
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,320
 come back with them so it might be I've got like a an out of date impression but certainly I

298
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,200
 remember some kind of like it's a report from this committee yes this committee exists will come

299
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,120
 back next year. I don't know whether it will become one of the recommendations of this committee

300
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,840
 but I'm going to keep talking about trying to conduct the business of WUSPUS in a way that does

301
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,480
 not require why would synchronous meetings. I think I think we don't need to handle most of our

302
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,560
 business in a way that is a synchronous way and we can do it asynchronously i.e it can be taken

303
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,640
 away and done online with text in ways that don't require everyone to make a specific meeting at a

304
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,680
 specific time and I think that would be a huge win for the international part of the community

305
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,360
 and I think it would be good and I think it can work because we see it work in other

306
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,520
 organizations and I think so I will not be letting that lie Liz so even if the committee doesn't

307
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,080
 report John will report but I suspect the committee will report. I obviously joined this group a

308
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,480
 little bit late but one of the things I've noticed is that quite a lot of the proposals that have

309
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,920
 come forward so far involve more work so that may be because of the people that they come from

310
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,240
 but what they what we're seeming to get is a lot of people suggesting things where we do a load of

311
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,120
 work asynchronously and then we do all the same work we're doing now synchronously and I think we

312
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:01,200
 need to have some stronger support for ideas that actually reduce the amount of work overall and in

313
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,680
 particular reduce the amount of work that has to be done all in one place at all in one time

314
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:13,680
 because those are the things that people find hard and and you know boards boards of international

315
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,120
 organizations manage to have board meetings that last an hour and there is absolutely no reason

316
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,440
 why WUSFUS should have to have 12 hours of meetings once a year. I think yeah I hope I am not one of

317
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:33,440
 the people who is coming up with ideas that are more work but not unless your proposals involve

318
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,320
 doing everything asynchronously and then taking it all back to a synchronous business meeting where

319
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,920
 people debate and vote in exactly the manner they do at the moment. No because I think we had a

320
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:49,600
 we had a non-binding vote for the entire community and I think actually having some more direct

321
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,040
 democracy in WUSFUS where things get decided by a vote of all members is a great idea

322
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,280
 and doesn't require any sort of synchronous activity. Sorry that probably all sounded a little

323
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:11,440
 stoner than I am. Nominations for the hue awards are still open if you have things you wish to

324
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:19,360
 nominate go nominate them and relatively quickly because this issue this episode is going to come

325
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,080
 out on the 13th and hue-go nominations will close on the 14th so if you are listening to it on

326
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,800
 Thursday the 13th nominations will close on Friday the 14th or technically Saturday the 15th

327
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,680
 depending on what times you are in so you don't have long go and nominate things yes but not us yes

328
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:45,680
 not us because we've recused and as previously mentioned I cannot talk about anything from 2024

329
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:52,560
 until hue-go nominations are completely closed neither can I and honestly it's actually quite

330
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,640
 tricky I keep thinking about retweeting things and being like oh no I can't retweet that it's

331
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,680
 tricky. The Locust Awards that bastion of true democracy the biggest science fiction

332
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:12,880
 democratically elected award the most famous the most important the Locust Award the 55th annual

333
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,000
 Locust Award yeah so if you care about that go do that I guess you need to be a member of Locust

334
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,080
 or something no if you're a member of Locust your vote counts twice because it's democracy oh yeah

335
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,000
 no I think we've made that joke before haven't we we have John is in a callback I'll make it every

336
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,480
 time it comes up but because presumably if you're not a member of Locust but you have more than one

337
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,520
 email address your vote can count what's for each of them oh no I know I say never do anything

338
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:46,640
 illegal I'm not even sure that's illegal so there we go unclear immoral unethical but but don't

339
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:55,120
 don't be like yes I am Alice and Scott and I am Skalison art I am Malison Dot like because

340
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:02,000
 they're gonna spot that one I am Alice and Scott with a random Cantonese numeral that will repeat

341
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,720
 I saw a an advert or mention of something called the Oxford Bloomsbury fantasy summer school

342
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,840
 which I had never heard of but it is it is what it says in the tin basically it is a joint thing

343
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,800
 where Blooms republishing support a summer school that takes place in Oxford in extra college it is

344
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,640
 three days of lectures and talks and it says it is aimed at anyone with an interest in fantasy

345
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,240
 literature aimed 16 age 16 or over and I thought it sounds quite academic but when you look at the

346
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,600
 frequently asked questions it says it's not an academic conference and is aimed at members of

347
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,240
 the public and A-level students interested in this important genre yeah and it sounds quite cool

348
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,880
 you can go and check on the uh lectures and talks that they have planned I mean there's not a specific

349
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,440
 thing but there is a long list of excellent sounding speakers including Professor Adam Roberts

350
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,600
 and there's like an afternoon where you get to talk with Bloomsbury publishing about like the

351
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,880
 landscape of fantasy fiction publishing and it sounds quite cool and if you want to go you have to

352
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,480
 basically it's free but you have to apply so there's a form where you can put your interest in

353
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,200
 express interest in it and why you would like to go and then they'll let you know in May if you

354
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,920
 have been selected it looked to me like if you want to just go online that is also an option and

355
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:30,960
 presumably that will not be limited in terms of places but I don't know yeah it does say we plan

356
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,240
 to livestream the school so anyone who can't come can listen to talk remotely which I would

357
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,560
 infer means yep it's all going to be streamed online but if you yeah if you want to go it's

358
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,800
 basically you have to pay for your travel and hotel whatever but it's free to attend which is very

359
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,960
 nice so it might be a nice opportunity for someone who wants to spend three days thinking deeply about

360
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,160
 fantasy literature and hanging around Oxford the thing you just quoted about streaming um that's

361
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:59,520
 not on the page that I'm on I did a control F for stream and the word stream doesn't appear on this

362
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:08,720
 page so what page do you want this on the FAQ uh nice okay cool like just just just good just very

363
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,600
 good and I think having it be in person but like streaming all the talks for anyone who wants to

364
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:19,040
 just watch the talks is very good idea nice and I would not have found this out if it was not for

365
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:26,640
 my glorious co-host Liz and I found out because someone put it on Facebook hey it works sometimes

366
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,800
 you're fine good stuff on Facebook very occasionally

367
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:42,480
 I want to plug a thing and the thing is a guff free ebook and in the manner of quite a lot of

368
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,840
 free things it says if you enjoy this free ebook a donation to guff is a fine way to express your

369
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:54,080
 appreciation for this free thing um so it is free but obviously we like donations because guff thrives

370
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:01,600
 on your donations um the this is the incomplete chronicles and I think big thanks to Dave Langford

371
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:09,360
 who's done the editing of this volume and he has brought together the known segments of unfinished

372
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,240
 guff going under fan fund or get up and over fan fund trip reports so obviously there's quite a

373
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,360
 lot of completed trip reports and where we've got them I think we've got 10 now for download on the

374
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,680
 free guff ebook site um but we also have incomplete ones for various reasons there'll be a link in

375
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:32,320
 the show notes um the people represented are Joseph Nicholas, Justin Ackroyd, Irwin Hirsch,

376
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,920
 Roman Alsadsky, Eva Houser, Paul Kincaid, Damian Worman and Juliet Woods and and Rosin and there's

377
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,640
 various reasons why the reports of these people haven't been completed but there's still chapters

378
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,600
 and there's lots of good reading in here and I strongly recommend everyone download it and

379
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:55,440
 and have a look at what we've got but thanks to Dave for putting it together and

380
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,800
 yeah thanks to all the guff winners who made this stuff available um none of my stuff appears here

381
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,000
 because I am in the process of writing my guff report and it is appearing in fanzines um and I don't

382
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,240
 think any of it has actually appeared yet but one of the pieces go to appear very shortly on

383
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,720
 octa thought and one of the pieces will appear shortly in idea and I am working on two more so

384
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,880
 it's good I thought and Rosin had a complete guff report it's just that it was in the medium of

385
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,280
 interpretive dabs she did yes so technically there is a complete a complete report but there

386
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,320
 are also segments in the incomplete chronicles one like I will note that the taff equivalent of

387
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,360
 this document is about to be updated to remove bits of my report from it since my report is now

388
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:50,160
 up but like the report I published was was basically in its entirety available you just had to go

389
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,280
 to the fanzines to read it and the bit I hadn't done was put it in one pdf yeah there are times

390
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,480
 when most of the writing has been done and it's the case of layout which is taking the time and

391
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,600
 then there are times when that is not the case and then there are times of interpretive dance

392
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:09,840
 as Anne showed us quite an episode title times of interpretive dance yes I and to follow up from

393
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,760
 previous episodes I think it's also a good time to remind people that taff voting is still open and

394
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,880
 you can go and vote for taff we had a brief discussion of this in a previous episode which

395
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,600
 I can't remember which one it was but there are some very worthy nominees for taff this year and

396
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:32,960
 you should go and look at their uh what do you call them not manifestos platforms yes you go and

397
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,760
 look at their platforms and vote and don't forget to also donate staff

398
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:51,200
 and then shall we do pics ah listen do you want to go first yes shall I go first so

399
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:59,040
 so one thing that Stephen and I like to do is go and see a movie sometimes shocking yes well we

400
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,360
 went to see Mickey 17 um which we've seen posters for a couple of weeks ago and Stephen was like oh

401
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:11,360
 oh it's a movie about Wolfenstein and I said what he said Mickey 17 and I was like oh god

402
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:19,600
 so I I thought all of you should now share that pain mhm thanks so we went to the kind of lunchtime

403
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,960
 showing yesterday and only afterwards we realized that nobody else has seen it yet I mean it's

404
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,680
 it's got reviews but it premiered yesterday so unless you manage to see one of those like

405
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,440
 Thursday night shows this was the first this was the first show in in our cinema um so this is the

406
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:43,760
 new film from Bonjourne Ho whose last film was Parasite which won everything um and it is based

407
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,000
 on a novel by Edward Ashton called Mickey 7 so there are 10 extra mikis in this one um I hadn't

408
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,840
 heard of the book or of Edward Ashton um and having read a couple of people writing about the book I

409
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:02,720
 think that might be because um Bonjourne Ho considerably amended the book when writing the

410
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,400
 script for the movie so he so there's a lot of changes from the book Robert Pattinson plays Mickey

411
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,200
 17 who is an expendable he he's he accidentally not quite accidentally but he needs to get off

412
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:22,000
 earth for reasons and he actually accidentally signs up to be an expendable spacefarer who is

413
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,640
 somebody who gets killed and then reprinted you know dies in the horrors of space because

414
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,680
 doesn't be no guys space is very dangerous um and then they just reprint him like on an inkjet

415
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,800
 printer and reload his memories from the last time they backed him up and he's good to go again

416
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,320
 and it's it's really good um I mean I think this is a very good film that everyone should watch

417
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,960
 I can't imagine there's going to be um five better films of this for my 2020 for my this year's

418
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,240
 Hugo nominations but we will see I thought Robert Pattinson was not all that good at acting but he

419
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:08,240
 does a really good job of this um the space trip he finds himself on is being run by a charismatic

420
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:15,040
 politician not very good charismatic politician played with great enthusiasm by Mark Ruffalo

421
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,480
 so if you like Mark Ruffalo being massively over the top then this is a film for you as well

422
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,760
 he has a equally over the top wife called Tony Collette and there's kind of busy

423
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,680
 see you stealing the scenes but it's hot this is kind of an anti-capitalist fantasy that talks

424
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,240
 about the way in which the capitalist regime uses people up without regard for their personal

425
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,680
 rights I liked it a lot I think it's very very good I didn't read any reviews I kind of I started

426
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,240
 listening to one review and then went oh about a minute in and went oh no Steven we should just go

427
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:57,040
 see this film rather than reading reviews first about half the reviews spoil the first major review

428
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,040
 of reveal of the film it's not a reveal it's going to be a huge surprise to anyone who's ever read

429
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,520
 a science fiction book um but there you go so Mickey 17 because he's the 17th version of Mickey

430
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,480
 because he's died horribly 16 times most of which you get shown it is a bong doing home film so it's

431
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,920
 got some it's got some fairly violent bits in it but it's also quite funny and it's got some good

432
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,840
 science fiction and I liked it a lot I suspect the spoiler you're talking about is that also spoiled

433
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,920
 in the trailer and posters so almost certainly so don't read don't look at the posters don't

434
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,880
 read the trailer so I I very much enjoyed this I'll push back a little bit on Robert Pattinson

435
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,480
 not be a good actor I think Robert Pattinson is a very good actor and has done some very interesting

436
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,520
 things yeah no he's really really good at this and I was like oh apparently he's better than I thought

437
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,000
 I mean I watched high life I mean I say I watched high life I watched the beginning of high life

438
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,200
 which I thought was an ex excribble movie but I did not find him the bad thing about it

439
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,920
 but yeah Mickey 17 is great it's very funny and when Alison said that they're printed out like an

440
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:10,160
 inkjet printer there's a visual gag there which is very very good several very funny visual gags

441
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:18,560
 but yeah and it's just it's much funnier than parasite and much less stressful but I do now

442
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,600
 want a tardigrade and I want a tiny little tardigrade and I want it to gamble I mean they're basically

443
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:31,040
 wood lice they're surveillance I've always thought wood lice were cute so so I I was trying not to

444
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,760
 listen to you hard you because I was thinking of going to see this tomorrow hey I don't think

445
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,040
 we've spilt heard a thing no I don't think you have I think it's because mostly because it's

446
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,640
 honored at a reasonable time and the other option was the brutalist starting at 10 30 a.m. and I

447
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,800
 think that might be too much if the brutalist is about to leave cinemas for you then what shit

448
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,720
 because you'll probably be able to go to bikki 17 next week but mikki 17 is kind of much easier

449
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,520
 to watch than the brutalist everything is probably about to leave cinemas or I don't know to be

450
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,960
 honest because it's hard to know when things actually come out and how long they'll stay out for so

451
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,640
 but I think mikki 17 sounds more fun than four hours of the brutalist so also for john have you

452
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:15,920
 heard of a thing called a pill millipede well I've heard of pill bugs but that's just the American

453
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:23,040
 word for a wood lice so a pill millipede I assume is like a very long woodhouse yeah nice thank you

454
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,520
 oh they're big though it reminded me this film basically is a cross between

455
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,800
 arrival parasite and how to train your dragon and it was good I liked it I don't know yeah I don't

456
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,080
 know if it'll be on my ballot we will see but I did enjoy it very much and um and also I will say

457
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:45,280
 mikki 17 is a better name than mikki 7 yeah I so the only person I know who's

458
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,600
 read this book and had you heard of Edward Ashland ever anyone I was vaguely aware of this book

459
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,200
 because it kept him up in amazon 99 p sales and then I saw it had been optioned by mong june

460
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,720
 hoe and was like oh that sounds interesting but I didn't know if it was like this is a great book

461
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,600
 which is optioned or if it was like the Martian I think it's a little bit like the Martian and

462
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,960
 it's suffered so I'm gonna say once again um I understand that there is a proportion of

463
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:21,440
 everybody on this planet who is a young beautiful straight white male able bodied man

464
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,560
 and nevertheless do you have to make if you're making a close first person

465
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,480
 movie where everything's going to be about this one character and what happens to him

466
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,000
 do you have to always pick that segment of humanity to make it about and I think that is

467
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,680
 probably also criticism of the novel but yeah Nicholas white has read and reviewed the novel and he's

468
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,360
 the only one of my friends who has I think but other reports of it say oh there's a problem with

469
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,760
 this novel because not that much happens and I have to say I do not think this was a problem with

470
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,480
 the movie I thought the movie had plenty of plot about the right amount of plot for a movie

471
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:06,160
 and it also had plenty of kind of satire and philosophy and all those sorts of good things

472
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,720
 that I wanted my science fiction movies I have heard of Edward Ashton because he's written a

473
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,480
 couple of short stories for a skate pod in the time when I was avidly listening to a skate pod

474
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,320
 so the name does ring a bell and I went on a skate pod to check and I just want to say his

475
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,680
 author bio is brilliant um Edward Ashton lives with his adorably mopie dog his inordinately

476
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:31,280
 patient wife and a steadily diminishing number of daughters oh which is a hell of a way to describe

477
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,960
 your daughters is like becoming adults and moving out I'm just like I just I might have to steal

478
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,720
 that my parents live with a steadily diminishing number of sons um so yes I like that very much

479
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:49,280
 it so he did a he did a tweet that really endeared me to him which was good news

480
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,760
 obsessing over every review of your new movie is excellent distraction from obsessing over

481
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:01,120
 every review of your new book yeah he sold the rights before the book came out which is

482
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:10,080
 quite unusual it's probably it's more unusual for newer authors uh shall I go next yes so I've

483
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,240
 been finding it hard to find things to pick because I can't pick anything from 2024 and I'm

484
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,920
 still trying to my own go reading yes so I'm really sorry for picking something from 2025 guys

485
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,400
 yes no go and pick things in 2024 we can't do it anymore or at least not for another couple

486
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,640
 weeks and even then probably not anyway so I'm picking something which is completely non-science

487
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:37,200
 fictional so forgive me but I am picking the tv show hacks which is a comedy show um about uh

488
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:45,040
 Deborah Vance who is a legendary comedian who's in the middle of a long long run on uh Las Vegas

489
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:51,680
 and her interactions with Ava Daniels who is a much younger female comedy writer and the kind of

490
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,960
 premises that Deborah is Deborah's act is a little stale but she is still a comedy legend

491
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,960
 whereas Ava is new and basically pretty arrogant and loses her current job because she makes a

492
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,760
 terribly insensitive tweet but it is a terribly insensitive tweet and so the idea is that she gets

493
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,440
 sent out to work with Deborah to try and make up new material for her show and I kind of avoid

494
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,200
 it because I knew I had good reviews but it didn't sound particularly appealing but it is actually

495
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,280
 pretty great one of the people behind it was the writer on like the good place in parks and rec

496
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,400
 so it's kind of from that sensibility and it's just it's pretty funny Deborah and Ava are both

497
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,960
 terrible people in some ways and can bring out the worst feature but sometimes bring out the

498
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,680
 best of each other I think it's main it's main selling point is that they got Jean Smart in to

499
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,880
 play Deborah Vance and Jean Smart is she was in uh Legion and Watchmen and Fargo and she's great

500
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,520
 basically so she would be worth watching anyway but they do surround her with an interesting cast

501
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,480
 and yeah I am really enjoying it I've finished watching series one there is two and three and

502
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,920
 then probably four and fives I think it got a lot of awards and it is surprising entertaining nice

503
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,800
 if you're in the UK this is on Amazon Prime I'm quite excited about this because I need a continuous

504
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,440
 stream of things to binge watch when Stephen doesn't watch me on to watch Telly and I've just

505
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,240
 finished drinking series too so this will be great probably go quite well after that.

506
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,840
 John Doppick what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna drop in some audio here of me and España drinking

507
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:31,600
 the thing I'm gonna pick so this is John and España Try Shrout by Gravitywell X Adrian Tchaikovsky

508
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:40,480
 X X there's an X look there's an X yes this is España hello that's the beer oh it's quite good

509
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:48,400
 sorry did it make you laugh while you were drinking yep that's actually quite good yeah sort of

510
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,720
 yeah sort of got that soft dank juiciness to it that I like in a pale ale yeah sort of sweet a

511
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,200
 little honey maybe maybe oh is that maybe that multi flavor that I think of as honey sometimes

512
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,160
 yeah yeah there's some more in there it's mellow yeah it has a cool label art with a spaceship

513
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,080
 oh it's the cover up for the book as a number yes it is yeah but yes there's a hazy pale ale

514
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:18,880
 and it tastes like it yep it does this was John and España Drink Trout by Gravitywell

515
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,640
 X Adrian Tchaikovsky so we went to Waltham Stowe the weekend just gone to hang out with the

516
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,720
 esteemed Kleberailey and Mark Plummer and the somewhat less esteemed but still fairly esteemed

517
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:38,560
 Alison Scott and Stephen came and drink beers a great many beers we were nearly thwarted by British

518
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:44,960
 trains so we went to London and we went drinking and the last venue was Gravitywell Brewing which is

519
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:51,280
 in Layton yeah it's a Layton middling but it's it's in one of the arches on to Layton midden railway

520
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,680
 station and they have made a beer in collaboration with Adrian Tchaikovsky so we bought some of the

521
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,600
 beers and then the next day we went to see Adrian Tchaikovsky launched the book for which this is a

522
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:10,720
 collab and he was in conversation with Oliver K Langmeade and Oliver K Langmeade wrote a book

523
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:18,640
 called Calypso and I have no editorial commentary on the book so Shroud is a 2025 release and so if

524
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,960
 I had read it in the last week I could have editorial commentary on that but I haven't but it is on my

525
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:31,600
 it is on my calax and also it is Adrian doing hard weird what happens if you put humans in this

526
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:37,440
 strange environment science fiction and the bit he read was very atmospheric and very good

527
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:44,640
 the beer itself has a QR code on it which links to a PDF of a short story that you can get

528
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:52,160
 if you sign up for the pamakmilla newsletter or you can go and read it on asterisk magazine's website

529
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,000
 where it was first published and where there are pictures and where you don't have to sign up for

530
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,320
 a newsletter so I've put that link in the show notes listeners because I am kind and nice and I

531
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:06,240
 think we talked about that on a previous episode and again I have no editorial comment on the short

532
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:12,480
 story and Adrian's interview was very good and we went to get hot chocolate afterwards but it does

533
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,080
 occur to me that this makes Adrian the quadruple threat because the novel is eligible in best

534
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,040
 novel the short story is eligible in best short story the interview is eligible in best dramatic

535
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,960
 presentation and the beer is eligible in best related work so I have some I have a sort of personal

536
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,880
 I don't which is the one I discovered this beer was available I phoned gravity well to say we will

537
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,080
 be door stopping your bar at two o'clock on sunday which is when you open on a sunday and please have

538
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:45,680
 some cans on this available for us to buy because it would be absolutely tragic if john didn't get

539
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,640
 one and the rest of us also wanted ones to take her we ended up buying most of the cans that they

540
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:57,680
 hadn't hidden the bar well actually what I will say is it turns out that if you went to the signing

541
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,480
 with Adrian and the reading when we got there they were like do you want a drink and they were

542
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,560
 like do you want coke lemonade wine and I was like do you have beer and they went yes and pulled out

543
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:11,600
 an entire can of shroud so it was like you can have some bad red wine in a little paper cup

544
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,600
 or you can have an entire can of great beer and I was like this is surely a non

545
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,160
 no brainer you were wondering on the sunday if they'd have beer at the signing and that was

546
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,680
 going to be my next question I want to just big up gravity well a bit because you can probably

547
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,040
 get gravity well beers from a good beer shop near you or from their website which is linked in the

548
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,560
 show notes their beers are all amazing they are absolute science fiction nerds

549
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:41,680
 so I think this is the first collab they've done with an author if your gravity well right in

550
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,000
 improved be wrong but I'd like to see much more of that if you're a science fiction author why

551
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,440
 don't you get in touch with gravity well and see if they'll do a collab with you because that sounds

552
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,120
 great too 10 out of 10 would drink more and their beers are absolutely lovely some of the gravity

553
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:05,120
 wells probably my favorite beer from available from a small brewery within one and a half miles

554
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:11,200
 of my house and that might not sound like much but we went to 11 tap rooms last weekend and

555
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,440
 and they're all one and a half miles from my house or less so go gravity well you're great

556
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,040
 keep doing what you do that was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye for me it's goodbye for me

557
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:39,760
 and it's goodbye for me

558
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:51,920
 we should move on to the next bit which is there's no Hugo category for sweet pastries

559
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,800
 yeah John do you want to explain why you wrote that in the show notes uh because it means that

560
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:05,600
 we can still pick sweet pastries and Alison can do her croissant story all right so this is where

561
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:11,040
 we're putting the croissants is it is it in this episode or is it going to be a special I thought

562
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,840
 it was a bonus special yeah I mean to be honest I can't remember why I wrote it in but I think that

563
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:21,920
 might have been it you just maybe you just thought it was funny maybe do you have that tumbleweed

564
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,960
 thing on your cup wall I mean I think it probably was funny at the time often true I mean I feel

565
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,160
 like there could be a hugo category for sweet pastries right so as long as they're genre related

566
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,200
