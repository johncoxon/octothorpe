1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,640
I'll be back in thirty seconds, I'm just gonna check my washing machine.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,000
See you still there.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:27,860
Hello everyone and welcome to the very first episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 12th of February 2026.

4
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:29,540
I'm John Coxon.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,939
I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty.

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,180
Did you say the very first episode?

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,820
I'm pretty sure this is the first episode.

8
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:37,699
Yeah.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,380
I don't think we've ever done this before.

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,300
It will all make sense later.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,180
And we have some letters of comment.

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,260
We heard from Paul Weimer.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:59,480
who wrote to say the person in genre other than Greg Ketter, who is on the ground for things happening here in Minneapolis, is the inestimable, and he says, I have tried to estimate her and consistently failed.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,560
Uh Naomi Kritzer, um who were both at one of the rallies in Powderhorn Park.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,120
And I had forgotten that Paul was in Minneapolis.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,400
But please stay safe, Paul, and also give him hell from us.

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,620
He likes the Brisbane logo, and he wants Nuremberg to have a similarly great logo, please.

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,460
I think Nuremberg does have a good logo.

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,540
We'll talk about Nuremberg a little bit later on.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:32,120
And he says he also looks forward to Montreal as to where Scott Edelman will record his Eating the Fantastic episodes since it is such a rich place for meals and restaurants.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,160
So yeah.

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,740
And then that will also be interesting food culture.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,259
Yeah, that is true.

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,860
There's gonna be some good good ether fantastic from that, yeah.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,780
And he says regarding Titan

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,619
He has played a lot of Avalon Hill games from back in the day, but not that one.

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,860
So fortunately we had a correspondent who has played Titan.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,560
We got a letter from Chris Garcia, who, as you know, listeners, often writes to us on about six different subjects all at once.

29
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,439
But this time he is writing entirely

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,040
about Titan and he says he picked up um Titan for five dollars at a yard sale and then took it to his gaming group.

31
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:20,780
We sat down to play it, threw some heads of garlic in the oven to roast, buying endless amounts of bread and cheese and cold beverages, and started to play around noon.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,360
Took a stroke break at one for lunch by six we were hungry again, we were nowhere near finished.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,320
At eleven or so Leon got up saying this is

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,000
Some bullshit and was about to storm off, though I talked him down, pointing to the hours we had already sent.

35
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,040
I ordered up another pizza at 3 or 4 a.

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,200
m.

37
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,400
we finished

38
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,100
If we hadn't talked down Leon from the Edge by explaining the sunk cost reality, we would have missed out on our tight enclosure.

39
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,900
Never let big fallacy's propaganda win.

40
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,340
Thanks, Chris.

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,360
Yes.

42
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,319
Um oh and I didn't actually play Titan.

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:01,079
Um my family rebelled, but they've promised to play in two weeks, so I will I will report back.

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,540
We have been playing other games that we haven't played for a long time.

45
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,900
I'm playing a game I haven't played for more than a year every day in February.

46
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:12,900
I mean, did your family rebel after hearing about it on the podcast?

47
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,300
Where it sounded like a terrible ordeal.

48
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,580
They rebelled after I sent them the twelve page

49
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,700
tiny text rule book and two how to play videos as their pre-game homework.

50
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,380
It it's actually much simpler than that really implies.

51
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,940
I mean I think if it was a modern game book it would

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:40,920
A they'd have reduced some of the fiddly rules, but B uh I think we're much better at writing rule books now, but not always.

53
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,980
I think that's that's true.

54
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,940
Yeah, there there probably is a market for not just like re-releasing old games but re-releasing them with a better rule book.

55
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,500
Maybe someone's written a better Titan rule book

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,000
Um if you've written the best titan rule book and you're out there, please let me know.

57
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,760
Um it's not a very complicated game.

58
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,560
You just kinda move round the board and gather creatures.

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,080
Oh Pokemon.

60
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,599
Yeah, a bit like that.

61
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,040
For 16 hours, according to Chris, so.

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,800
There is a BoardGameGeek document which is called Titan All the Rules on Two Pages.

63
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,019
Yeah, that's just the same thing but in two point type instead of five point type.

64
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,060
I don't it's not it's not actually that bad.

65
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:20,340
No, it's not.

66
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,040
There we go.

67
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,000
That looks pretty good.

68
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:33,040
Like for those who don't know, I know I'm I'm not trying to teach either of you to suck eggs, but uh but those listening who don't know, BoardGameGeek is a fantastic resource for um rewritten and summarized rule sets.

69
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,660
And there are some games where the the community written rules are better than the ones that came in the box.

70
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,979
So highly recommend that if you've got a complicated

71
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,920
game that you're not grokking.

72
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,160
Yes, I feel like anyone who's listened to all the episode of this podcast will be familiar with Board Game Geek at this point.

73
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,940
It's a great resource for all sorts of things.

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,819
Yes.

75
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,180
And we also heard from Scott Edelman who says that I pronounced his name right.

76
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,060
Yay!

77
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:10,220
Glad to hear it, Scott, and he also linked to some lovely podcasts including ours, but also including Cood Street and Hugo Girl and Skiffy Infanti.

78
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,140
and um and his own Eating the Fantastic.

79
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:20,980
And he says the wonderful thing about podcasts like that is that if you listen to enough of them, it's possible to feel as if the con never ends.

80
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,020
And that is kinda I think part of what we're trying to do.

81
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,220
So that's lovely.

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
That's th that's the Octothorpe um mission statement right there.

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,240
Um, except with less beer, because if the con never ended I'd die on about day hundred and twenty.

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,199
That's fair.

85
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,599
You think you're getting as far as hundred and twenty?

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,599
I had my first beer yesterday.

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,380
Well congratulations, it's a nice drink and I recommend it.

88
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,260
Uh we also heard From Rosanna Pendlebury who says that I am a terrible person.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,320
You're welcome, Rosanna.

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,160
Why I think we should just leave it there.

91
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,260
W

92
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,760
Lions Only in Kenya.

93
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,480
Yeah.

94
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,460
I mean it we are bad people, it's true.

95
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:00,979
I'm I'm not a bad person.

96
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,340
I I I was not familiar with this um oeuvre.

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,180
I mean I wasn't familiar with the oeuvre, I just wasn't p familiar with this particular gift for reasons I don't entirely understand.

98
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,860
We also heard from uh

99
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,139
Ali Maker who shows a photo of what a proper podcast recording studio looks like.

100
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,180
So Ali write in and tell us what you're doing in the podcast recording studio.

101
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,100
It looks a lot fancier than mine

102
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,420
Because yours doesn't have any of your washing drying at the background.

103
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,220
Yes.

104
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,540
It also has less Lego than mine though, so it's kind of uh there are pros and cons.

105
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,740
Pros and cons, I would say.

106
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,380
Hmm.

107
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,420
It's not unlike mine except that I've got a

108
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,900
Chocolatarme en croissant.

109
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,979
Also John has a funky purple light.

110
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:46,659
It I will say, listeners, for those who can't see Alison on the camera, it is quite a lot unlike Alison's, and I would argue most respect.

111
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,159
You can't see my podcasting surface.

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,080
You're seeing the desk there.

113
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,599
Hang on guys.

114
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,639
Oh god

115
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
No, no, no, oh no.

116
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,440
What have I done?

117
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,120
Alright, but there's no fire exit sign in your room and there's quite a lot of wardrobes.

118
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
And beacons and um

119
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:14,520
And a map of Texas and one of Dave Hardy's pen pots full of pens and some Chinese

120
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,080
ball things that jingles.

121
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,080
It's not probably not appropriate for podcasting because they jingles and podcasting is supposed to be quiet.

122
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:31,060
Yeah, I mean I think a key a key point of uh a professional podcast studio is that they probably don't have things that jingle.

123
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,940
Lots of random shit.

124
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,580
Oh sorry, we went went in different directions with that list.

125
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,300
Different directions, but both

126
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,800
Both legit, I think.

127
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,520
Fine.

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Uh yes.

129
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,040
But thank you very much, Ali.

130
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,320
That is very lovely.

131
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,280
Fine.

132
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:58,940
And Alexandra Lanez wrote in saying that Psych Lacrosse reminds me of her school English teacher's determination that the sport of the future was escalator netball.

133
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,479
And I'm just saying that next time we're at the CCD for Dublin Worldcon, we should play Escalator Netball.

134
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,680
If everyone involved with risk assessment at Dublin could please not have listened to that, that would be great.

135
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,640
Escalator netball's probably better than escalator cricket.

136
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,840
You've gotta you've really gotta adjust for the exact motion of the escalator when you're trying to take wickets.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,480
I don't know.

138
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:20,960
I

139
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:28,380
I challenge listeners, if you can write in and tell us a sport that would not be improved by playing on an escalator, then I'll buy you a pint.

140
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Specifically, sport that would not be improved by playing it on the escalators at Dublin 2029.

141
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,760
I think there's a rich vein of uh of um of of of possibility here.

142
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,440
So thank you very much Alexandra.

143
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,640
In fact, W Twenty Twenty Like we've got a program item for you that we're happy to run.

144
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,240
Dublin 2029, Escalation Olympics.

145
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,120
You know how sometimes like you you see a sign or a list of rules and you're like, I know exactly why that rule is there.

146
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,079
Yep.

147
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:01,399
You are not allowed to have run a decathlon on the escalators.

148
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,040
Follows.

149
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,639
But speaking of cricket

150
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:13,880
Ivan wrote to say that he spent lots of time playing games of dice cricket in between

151
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,060
watching television SF, so that means it's back on topic again.

152
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm not sure that's true.

153
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,620
On what's been a very nostalgic week

154
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,140
The memory of Marvin the Paranoid Android bowling Captain Kirk for a Duck brings a smile to my face.

155
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,820
And Ming wrote

156
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:40,240
to tell us that there was a Sabutio cricket game, which I was familiar with because I've kind of got it I i it's worth quite a lot of money now and I I keep an eye out for it in charity shops.

157
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,200
In fact most Sabutio is worth picking up in charity shops.

158
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:55,279
Obviously I'm I'm only really wanting Sabutio for the Duke of Prague away kit, which was not great Kev Kev McVeigh says that he played that when they were twelve and so um

159
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,880
I would have loved to play Sabo uh Cricket Sabutio.

160
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
I've never actually played Sab Sabutio generally.

161
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,240
I think Cricket Sabutio's not very good.

162
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,839
I think that's why it didn't survive.

163
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,839
That's probably true actually, isn't it?

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,160
What I will say is that

165
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,040
Waterstones sells house at in a nice tiny little box.

166
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,160
You know they've got their rotate little shelves of like desk toys and other

167
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,980
Other stocking fillers.

168
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,700
Junk.

169
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,180
Um hows that is one of the things you can get now.

170
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,300
So um so yeah, is available in all good bookshops.

171
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,819
Apparently it's the the ones that you carve yourself out of school pencils are better though.

172
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,180
I mean quite possibly.

173
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,980
I I I confess our school game of choice was battleships.

174
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:45,140
So I think I can be told now, because on eBay I discovered a thing called Battleshops.

175
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,020
Yes.

176
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,220
Which is a girly version of Battleships.

177
00:10:49,459 --> 00:11:00,980
where instead of doing anything so crude as to sink ships, you you are finding objects in shops like a mini skirt or on a mobile phone, um, and you don't

178
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,960
hit them with torpedoes because that's not that's too girly.

179
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,960
You you sort of surround them, which feels quite Freudian to me.

180
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,760
So you surround your object with the result that the actual parts are extremely and and

181
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,980
With the result that the parts are extremely tiny.

182
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:25,260
So I got this and we played it and obviously it was a lot of fun and then I sent it to Esther and said you might find this useful in your in your teaching practice.

183
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,820
Um

184
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,280
And it has blown her students' mind apparently.

185
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,200
So hello Esther.

186
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,400
Um hope you're listening.

187
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
Um hope you love Battle Shops.

188
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,680
I I couldn't believe it existed.

189
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,560
Um and it's a real it's real Hasbro MB product.

190
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,480
Somebody actually sat down and said

191
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,860
Not enough girls are playing a naval um bombardment game.

192
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,300
What can we do to make it more attractive to the

193
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,200
To the pink aisle.

194
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,880
It obviously didn't work.

195
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,800
It's quite a rare game now.

196
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,080
Interesting.

197
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,080
But I owned it very, very briefly.

198
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,560
No, Esther showed us that on a SmothCon forty three meeting.

199
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,360
So yeah.

200
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,480
It is odd.

201
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
Gendered toys are very strange.

202
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:15,459
Yes, gendered toys are very strange and toys have become slightly le that was probably the absolute peak of of gendering of

203
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,620
of board games, but but th I I kind of understand why it happens.

204
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,020
'Cause they think, well, Battleships is clearly a great game that has stood the test of time.

205
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,060
I'm not sure that's actually true.

206
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,340
It's not a very good game.

207
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:33,579
I mean I think it was a great game in the past when, you know, actual entertaining things didn't exist.

208
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,660
And also it's better on pencil and paper than it is used with the color plastic game there's quite a lot of games that

209
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,340
uh the the actual substance that they're selling is of no use because it's just as good playing it on pencil and paper.

210
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,460
But I think Battleships is actually better on pencil and paper.

211
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:57,700
Fiona Moore wrote on Facebook uh in response to our chat about miniature things last episode and she has posted a lovely

212
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,580
uh miniature kit that she's made.

213
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,780
So if you're on Facebook go and check out the um Octoth 152 post because she's supposed to fix there and it's pretty great.

214
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,700
We heard from uh

215
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,400
Tommy Ferguson with a very useful clarification.

216
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,960
So last episode we talked a lot about the finances of uh the Belfast Eastercon.

217
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:24,339
And he has clarified that the pass-along that they got, so we remember we got about 40k of pass along.

218
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,860
They've clarified that half of that came from Titancon, which was the previous

219
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,300
Belfast Convention.

220
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:36,259
And so therefore that's basically being passed along to NornCon, the next Northern Irish uh science fiction convention.

221
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,160
So that I think is a very useful clarification.

222
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:48,280
And so basically the same amount is now being passed along from one Northern Ireland con to the next to give them that buffer, which yeah, it's a good way of doing it.

223
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,680
Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense.

224
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,640
We were talking a little bit about this last episode, but I think it makes a lot of sense that um that that's how they've gone and I think that's great.

225
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,880
Alright, shall we talk about SmofCon?

226
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,760
Yes, we got a letter about SmoFCCon.

227
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,680
We did get a letter about SmofCon.

228
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:19,800
SmovCon 43 has a website and stuff and they're gonna be running in Lisbon from the 4th to the 6th of December in 2026.

229
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:26,140
So they are going to be back at the VIP Executive Arts Hotel in Parc de Nacos.

230
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,780
I'm not even trying to pronounce that right, cuz

231
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,840
Portuguese man, it's hard language.

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,680
Sorry any Portuguese fans listening.

233
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,600
I like Portuguese and I like Spanish, but I know you don't pronounce Portuguese like you pronounce Spanish, despite the fact that the words look the same.

234
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,040
Correct, yes.

235
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,480
And as someone who knows a little bit of Spanish

236
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,040
Mm-hmm.

237
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,440
So yeah.

238
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:55,080
They have a focus on trying new things, explains Meg MacDonald, who wrote in to us about it.

239
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:02,980
They want to explore fresh ideas in both program topics and delivery, and they know that real innovation means being willing to make mistakes and learn from them.

240
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:15,620
For them, the experience of experimenting and discovering what works is as important as the final outcome, and they would love to hear ideas from the wider community and suggestions can be sent in via the program form on the website where you can also

241
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,920
Attend.

242
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,519
You can click the link and you can buy a membership.

243
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,959
85 euros lets you attend or attend online.

244
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,740
35 euros lets you attend but only online.

245
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,459
There's a discounted rate of also of 35 euros for anyone who can't afford the full HAC.

246
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,620
And there is a 25 euro I Love Lisbon membership

247
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,459
For people who don't want to go to the convention but want to go to all the parties.

248
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,779
Now, I looked at this and I was like, ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho

249
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,580
So in fact Stephen had an I Love Lisbon type let membership.

250
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:54,220
Last time SmothCon was in Lisbon he had a a friend uh family membership where he didn't go to the convention and he went off and explored Lisbon.

251
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,540
And although I had a really good time at Smovcon, I think he probably had a better time.

252
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:06,940
exploring Lisbon and I'm kind of like, oh, because the problem with SmovCon is I'm very worried that I'd go to SmovCon and I'd get very enthusiastic about

253
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:20,860
Con running, somebody would have a great idea, even I might have a great idea, and then I'd be committed to doing a big thing and then I would not in fact be able to do it because apparently because the great thing about my life now is that I can't do the things I commit to do, which is

254
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,120
really very unpleasant and weird for me.

255
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,040
Um so I have to find a way to go to SmothCon because we really want to go back to Lisbon.

256
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,720
We had a great time last time.

257
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,360
And

258
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,440
not actually take on any commitment so maybe I should just get the I am going to party.

259
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:42,360
But I probably do want to go to the programme as well so that I can I can say somebody should do this, but it's not gonna be me.

260
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:49,480
Also, I'm gonna say something, and maybe this is not true, but I think most of the commitments to do things are at the parties.

261
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,480
Yeah, no, that's the other problem.

262
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:58,220
I mean I mean I just have to go to Lisbon wearing a big t shirt saying, Do not let me say yes to anything at any point this weekend.

263
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,900
Also, when you say they're doing this and they're doing that and they're doing all these great

264
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:09,740
I am looking at the committee list and who is listed on the committee for SmofCon forty-three.

265
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,539
Yes, I'm doing the Discord.

266
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:12,339
Brilliant.

267
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,740
And also I'm not gonna this is a not for pod thing.

268
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,459
I'm gonna make this exact same joke on Nuremberg, so could you introduce Nuremberg much the same way?

269
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:19,960
Excellent.

270
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,880
I'm gonna leave that in obviously uh so that people know the joke is coming.

271
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,320
Um but yes.

272
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,240
Right.

273
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,560
But yeah, no, I'm I'm helping with the Discord.

274
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,160
Um I'm listed on the website.

275
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,640
Uh I look at this committee and I go

276
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,280
This is there are 12 people listed here.

277
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,800
Um, I think only three of whom have chaired a Will Conn.

278
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,200
And I feel like this might be significant overkill for uh

279
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,200
Slovcon.

280
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,640
You might be right.

281
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,920
I remember I remember Ian Sorensen saying the correct number of people for a committee of two hundred for a convention of two hundred is about one

282
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,820
Um, because he didn't really like other people helping.

283
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,300
But um I mean people helped on the day.

284
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,620
But are they just gonna have a good time then?

285
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:17,559
I will say that only one person on this podcast who is a kind of previous SmofGongoer has proposed just buying the party membership so they can go and hang around with people they like who are putting on this convention but not actually joining the convention.

286
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:32,179
But I would say if one of your goals is to do a bunch of experimental things and try different things, then you may want a bunch of people who decide, okay, this is the experimental thing we are gonna try and this person will be dedicated to trying this experimental thing.

287
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,180
I think if you've got a committee that works well together, then have a bigger committee.

288
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,900
Like the main problem with having too many people is the sort of too many cooks spoil the broth thing.

289
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:52,360
But on the other hand, I think people who have been Worldcon chairs are gonna be very familiar with, okay, I should stop or I should try and stick to my lane a bit and not take on everything or not get in other people's way.

290
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,400
Like it probably works better than having a random committee of twelve.

291
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,380
So like John, you're gonna do the Discord, right?

292
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,220
And you're gonna do Discord.

293
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,420
How are you going to try new things in the Discord, John?

294
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,340
Oh well, what I've done so far is um

295
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,040
I've I've got a co-working channel.

296
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,920
That's new.

297
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
I've not done that before.

298
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,880
Experimental.

299
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
I know all of the people on this committee except Vinger.

300
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,640
So who is Vinga?

301
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,480
That is the question, isn't it?

302
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,000
Vinga is a Polish fan.

303
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,720
Brilliant.

304
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,919
She's very lovely.

305
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,559
And she was on a panel with me at SmovCon.

306
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,720
So this is the second episode of Octhorpe.

307
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,200
She has been mentioned in, but she was on the panel about crisis management.

308
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:34,840
She's good.

309
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,440
She runs Polish conventions.

310
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:45,280
I think so I'm gonna go back to there's an argument here you probably do need a convention staff of more than one.

311
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,380
When you're doing a hybrid convention.

312
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,940
Like, because I don't think you could sensibly get rid of JT off this list.

313
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:57,060
And I think these days you probably also need someone who is doing treasurer.

314
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,020
because it got harder to do treasurer.

315
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,700
Yeah, I think I think there are a number of ways in which running a convention, even a small convention, is a little bit harder.

316
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,980
I mean we had a committee of five for the punctuations as they were online.

317
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah, and I would say at least three of us were diligently working hard.

318
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:16,240
You don't mean me, do you?

319
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Uh you well no hang on.

320
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,580
Four of us were diligently working hard.

321
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,020
One of those four was working, I would say, on

322
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,720
Quite speci she had her own brief.

323
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,320
No one really knew what the brief was, but by jove she was working on it.

324
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,360
Like the morning I woke up and discovered you had just been making badges solidly for twenty-four hours.

325
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
And like we were like, but why?

326
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,600
That's something you're doing.

327
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,240
You were like

328
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,560
Badges!

329
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,440
Badges!

330
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,280
Which was great.

331
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,480
Uh but yeah.

332
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,960
This is what me this is what I am like now.

333
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm sorry, but that's why I can't do any more con running.

334
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,080
That was the sort of innovative thing we did at we did at uh punctuation.

335
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,520
We had virtual badges.

336
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
It's tricky, I do think.

337
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:08,460
I think there is an element here where like I'm obviously on for the Discord, Andrew and Emily are on for like um other kind of technical aspects, I think.

338
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,300
JT's on for at venue tech, Steve's treasurer.

339
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,660
Um Rogiero is the Portuguese facility person.

340
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,660
Radek and Vinger, I think, are on there for promotions.

341
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,340
But like that's the other thing.

342
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,780
We don't have a lot of very fixed you can tell from the committee list, like no one has a little word under them except for facilities and treasurer.

343
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,860
So it is quite a freeform thing.

344
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,860
And chairs.

345
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,660
That's fine.

346
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,620
And chairs.

347
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:40,260
Um, but I also think like me, Emily, Andrew, Vinger and Radick and JT are all people on their

348
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,799
Maybe less JT, maybe JT doesn't need this upskilling.

349
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,160
But there's an element of like trying to upskill younger fans as well, I think.

350
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,720
Yeah, no, I think it's a great it is good that some s there's some younger people in there.

351
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,120
It's oh this is good.

352
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,679
This is how to say this nicely.

353
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,440
This seems to me to be really building for the future in a way that I don't see so much of in North American SmothCon teams.

354
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,320
Yeah.

355
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:06,780
Fair?

356
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,780
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

357
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:15,580
I don't want to be rude, but I think that is that fe this feels like where European con running is at, right?

358
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,380
Some of where it used to be at and some of where it is now now.

359
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,180
Yeah.

360
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,420
And the other thing is obviously like if if someone becomes incapacitated.

361
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,940
So like I mean

362
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,240
So, you know, if someone has family issues or or whatever, it gives you redundancy and you don't have to recruit at that point.

363
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,560
You've already recruited, so you can shift the load.

364
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
But yeah, no, it'll be good, hopefully.

365
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,919
And you can donate to the Bursary Fund.

366
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,280
There's a link at the bottom of the page if you'd like to do that.

367
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,240
Nuremberg have launched their new website.

368
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,000
It has an adorable little logo which is the Nuremberg City Shield.

369
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,580
But they've made the eagle into an adorable little purple and green eagle with a little antenna, and he is adorable.

370
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,940
Best eagle ever.

371
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,860
And the Nuremberg, um

372
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:22,440
WillCon has built out its bid team because I think we talked about how they the co-chairs went to SmothCon and were keen and nice and said they wanted to learn and they wanted to get some people on the team and they now have some people on the team.

373
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,720
Um, John, are you in any way related to the John Coxson who's listed as being on the Nuremberg Big Committee?

374
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,760
It is me.

375
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm helping out with the Discord.

376
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

377
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,480
So

378
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:42,380
Near so near the Nuremberg ha I looked at their website, so they do have an executive board and then a thing called Bid Committee and Advisors and Team and then Bid Boosters.

379
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:42,940
Um

380
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:55,440
Which is interesting because there was some comment on Vile seven seventy that, you know, the Chair and the Vice Chair are I believe they're German and are the kind of nexus around the the the bid

381
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,060
Right.

382
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:03,980
So there was some discussion on file seven hundred because um previously at SmovCon I think we'd met the chair and the vice chair of Nuremberg 2028.

383
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:16,060
Who are both German and then they launch with a much bigger team, which does include a lot of names who are familiar from UK and European and US con running and um

384
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,060
Only a couple of those are German.

385
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,460
And that did come up with some comments.

386
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,700
And I think it's quite interesting because I think there's various ways that cons do like

387
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,280
listing of their bid committees and things.

388
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:36,360
Like, in some cases your bid committee is a small set of people and they are the people who are going to form the nexus of the actual con committee.

389
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,740
And sometimes a bid committee is just a lot of people who are uh helping out in some way.

390
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,140
And so I wasn't sure whether this was the kind of the former or the latter.

391
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:54,460
It is because it's obviously good to have like lots of experienced people who say, yeah, actually we think this bid is a good thing and we are supporting it and we are helping.

392
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,620
Um you've got to balance that with

393
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:03,380
And also here are all the people from the region who think this is cool and are also getting involved.

394
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,900
So I thought that was an interesting thing.

395
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,020
They now have a Bid Booster section, which I think is lots of

396
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,160
German fans, authors, etc.

397
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,600
, who are also uh keen to support them.

398
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,680
And I do also understand that they have gone from zero to, you know, we are filing our bid papers in

399
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,760
like three months for a bid a bid vote this summer.

400
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,960
So they're doing everything on a slightly shorter time scale.

401
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,000
But I thought it was interesting people saying, Mm, do you have more

402
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,539
you know, German fans involved.

403
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,100
Especially given there is uh a con in Germany this summer, the MetropolCon.

404
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,020
Yeah, so I think it's interesting because when I was at SmorfCon

405
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,120
One of the sorry I had a chat with um Claudia Rapp um among others.

406
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:55,360
And like there was basically I think they're quite excited about the idea of a German WorldCom, but they were like, we cannot help before Metropolcom.

407
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,760
Because of Metropolcon.

408
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:08,520
And so like, yeah, someone on Fast Something was like, you know, there's not that many Germans involved, but I think that will change as the bid becomes an actual world con potentially.

409
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,580
I also think it's being led by people from Nuremberg.

410
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,180
So like I don't

411
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,960
think that I I see that as very much a good thing.

412
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:27,240
Like it's not like it's not like it's being chaired by people who are not German and who do not know the area.

413
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,559
So I think that's another consideration

414
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,740
Yes, so the chair is Florian Bailey.

415
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:39,380
Um we've commented on his excellent hats in previous episodes and um Ruben, who we've talked about before.

416
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:50,820
Um the other two people on the executive board are Tammy Coxson and Colin Harris, who will be known two people in sort of the Com Running community, but basically Tammy is a longtime

417
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,620
Worldcon and other convention volunteer and she chaired the 2014 NASFIC uh as well.

418
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,940
And then Colin Harris was the co-chair of the 2005 Worldcon.

419
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,200
and has been on chair staff and the advisory kind of um staff for many world cons.

420
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,200
Uh many, many, many

421
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,500
Um and they've got various other people involved.

422
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,860
There is a thing I think a lot of this panel of people is coming from

423
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,820
conversations they had at SmovCon.

424
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:30,260
Um like and Smovcon was in Stockholm obviously and there were some German fans there, but like I think I think they're kind of getting the experience people that they can from where

425
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,340
the volunteering is and then they will expand later.

426
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:40,060
Because I think like Liz said, like they are close to the vote and they need to skill up quickly.

427
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,300
And so they've kind of been working with the people who want to work with them.

428
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:54,660
But ultimately, like, you know, there are a lot of British and US Com runners who are not working on anything in the twenty twenty eight year because Brisbane

429
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,700
is the other bid and that's in Australia.

430
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:01,500
So like they and they don't seem to have much um staffing from the US and the UK.

431
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,460
So like I think there's also a thing here where there's a lot of people who

432
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,240
have capacity who were interested in there being a convention in a a work on in Germany.

433
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,720
Because I mean part of the reason I'm excited

434
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,580
is because there's not been a Worldcon in Germany for a long time.

435
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,260
Nineteen seventy.

436
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,420
And the thing is, I like the idea of expanding the franchise of Worldcon.

437
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,140
And so when there's like a Worldcon in a country that hasn't held a Worldcon for fifty-six years

438
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,220
Right, yeah, I I'll probably help out a little bit with that because I think that's a good thing that that we should do.

439
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,419
I mean similar if there had been a Dutch bid.

440
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,160
um I might have been quite keen to get involved with that for similar reasons.

441
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,480
So yeah, I think that's that's I I can't speak for other members of the team.

442
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,200
Um but that was my I think part of my desire to get involved.

443
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:54,000
I am I'm going to say I would very much like to see the Os the Worldcon go back to Australia and there has been a

444
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,760
Work on on the European continent quite well actually there hasn't.

445
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,880
But yeah.

446
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,480
Mo more recently than there's been one in Australia at any rate.

447
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,720
So it's been a while now for Australia.

448
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,760
Yes.

449
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,820
It's time they had another bed.

450
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:09,100
Another cupboard club.

451
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,380
It's been a while.

452
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,980
To be fair, it's not it's um it's coming up on a decade since the last Continental European one, right?

453
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,320
Cause yeah, if you don't count i you know, because that specifically doesn't count the UK and Ireland.

454
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,680
And also, I think in the light of having many fewer US bids

455
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,040
It would we do need to get more European bids going to fill that gap.

456
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,760
So Nuremberg seems to be a good thing from that perspective to me.

457
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:45,000
Nuremberg have also announced their dates, which they would propose running from Thursday the thirteenth of July to Monday the seventeenth of July.

458
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:54,000
Which is earlier than many Walcons have run, but they basically explain that that's why they'll get a good rate and it's a good time to run stuff in Nuremberg.

459
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,559
I think that's

460
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:04,840
I mean that's fine with me, but um I'm not wedded to any particular, you know, set of dates and we have to have a Worldcon unless you'd propose running it in like February or something.

461
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,360
I don't really mind.

462
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:13,700
I mean I think we should definitely do it in the summer, because the re one of the reasons I want to go to Nuremberg is to like go and sit in beer gardens.

463
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,180
Well I agree we should definitely do it in the summer.

464
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,780
I I I would argue Brisbane should be running for the Australian summer.

465
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,419
Yeah.

466
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,780
It is wildly hot in Brisbane in summer.

467
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,740
It's gonna be very nice in Brisbane in August.

468
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:28,059
Well that and that's the other thing.

469
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:33,580
With climate change, I I wonder whether May-June WorldCons would be quite a lot nicer anyway.

470
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,980
I think having a Worldcon at the right time of year is important.

471
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:40,779
I think that's very variable and I'm not sure the answer is August for all countries worldwide.

472
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:48,320
I don't know, if we had like an Indian world con, I wouldn't want it necessarily to be a monsoon season, and if we had a Florida one, I wouldn't want it to be in a hurricane season.

473
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,120
I think summer is less important than

474
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,220
Nice weather and a nice time to visit specifically.

475
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,220
I mean there are there are problems with running a Worldcon in February, not

476
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,600
limited to the fact that, you know, it would completely mess up your Hugo system.

477
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,919
You know, and then you'd also have to have basically a deadline for filing the bids that was, you know, September, so about a week after the last WorldCom potentially.

478
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,919
So I think there are issues with it.

479
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:24,540
But really I just want you to have it at a time when the temperature is relatively nice and you can actually get your venue and and so on and so forth.

480
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,860
Now the Hugo's is a good point.

481
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:32,059
So those proposed dates are in the United States school summer holidays.

482
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,860
They are not in the United Kingdom school summer holidays.

483
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,100
And I went to the internet to go, but I have no idea about German school summer holidays.

484
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,620
And what I discovered

485
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:53,900
Is that the German school summer holidays are different in the different states of Germany to manage tourism and which is a very I guess that's just an extraordinary German thing to do, but in fact they're not in the Nuremberg, Nuremberg's Bavaria and Bavaria break late.

486
00:31:54,019 --> 00:32:02,179
So they're not in the Nuremberg School Summer holidays, which I think is a little bit of a shame because Worldcon is partly on weekdays and

487
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,340
Teachers and parents can't often get there.

488
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,420
Parents of school day children can't get there if it's not in the school holidays.

489
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,500
It it's like the last two days of term in the UK, isn't it?

490
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:25,100
Any date is gonna be bad for some people, but they basically explain that it's the time they get good rates and it also means they don't clash with two other big festivals in the summer in Nuremberg, so I suspect they have very little choice.

491
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,500
And so that seems fine to me.

492
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:36,299
But I will also say I guess there's also as well as like 'cause if they can make it cheaper for Germans to attend, that might be better than making it easier for

493
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:36,960
You know?

494
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,880
There's uh it's uh it's uh what?

495
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,760
Intersectional.

496
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,560
It's intersectional.

497
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,680
Yeah, but if you literally if that's when you can get your venue, that's kinda when you get your venue.

498
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,320
Yep.

499
00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:00,440
The other news this week is that the Rwanda in 2028 World Compid are withdrawing.

500
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:10,419
It's about the time where cons have to start filing their paperwork for the site selection vote at LA and the Conchigali team say basically

501
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,660
uh their efforts to mobilize resources to sustain the bid have been very difficult.

502
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,340
Uh they do say that's due to ongoing immigration changes in USA and around the world.

503
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,260
I think they probably looked at

504
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:33,420
The fact they're gonna have a three-way contested bid, the amount of money and the amount of like personal time and effort it would take them in the current climate to actually be able to go and run a campaign between now

505
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,340
And well con and decided it is not the right year.

506
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,900
So they are withdrawing from twenty twenty-eight

507
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,800
But they are launching a new initiative.

508
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,880
They have a new mailing list you can sign up to to try and bring a Worldcon to Africa.

509
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,880
And I'm glad they're doing that because it must be very disappointing that they've kind of put a lot of effort into this and have to withdraw

510
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:02,419
almost at the last possible moment and so fingers crossed that in a more favorable climate they can uh try again.

511
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,419
I will note that on the Anonymous Claire Discord server

512
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:18,679
Um Farah Mendelssohn noted that a team is forming to support them to make another bid and Tammy Coxon posted saying if you'd like to be updated on African Worldcon activities or even better volunteer to help.

513
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,280
please join their mailing list.

514
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:26,920
So I think there is a a team of international com runners who are trying to make this

515
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,279
something that is supported and can happen for the people who want it to happen and I think that is good.

516
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,119
This is the sort of thing we said might be a good idea on previous episodes and so it is very good that it is happening

517
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:46,920
I mean having just discussed the Nuremberg bid team and and how many of its members were from like Germany or continental Europe, this is the thing you have to balance, right?

518
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,560
Like you want your bid team to

519
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:56,140
feel like they're really a big team from that location and enthusiastic about bringing the con to that location.

520
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,380
But if you can get support from people who

521
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:13,260
have have run WorldCons previously and also who can go to the places that are difficult for you to get to and maybe at least be a present there um and then get them to join your mailing list, sign up, support the bid, etc.

522
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,380
Then I think

523
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:19,260
That unfortunately is the way they have to go given the restrictions they've got on where they're able to go.

524
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,620
It's why I think that it's important to make sure that you're not a completely foreign team.

525
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,160
But you can't be a purely ex-country team.

526
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,840
You can if you're the US.

527
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,120
You probably can if you're the UK, although I think it would be harder.

528
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,800
But for countries that do not have the heritage of running conventions like that we have, is is impossible.

529
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,760
You cannot do that.

530
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,240
And so I think we do need to bear in mind that there is a difference between a kind of

531
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,460
Um I uh hostile takeover is the phrase that comes to mind.

532
00:35:52,620 --> 00:36:02,860
But like I think I think there's a difference between a hostile takeover from foreign fans who are doing it in a uh uninclusive way and supporting local fans to do the thing they want to do.

533
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:15,720
I think both I think Nuremberg has struck that balance from my perspective, and I hope that Chigali can as well, but I don't think not having any US or UK fans involved is a wise decision for them.

534
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,440
I think it's better to have other people who can help out.

535
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,080
I just hope they get the team together, get it together, get to do it another time.

536
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,960
Who is gonna talk about 2029?

537
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,920
I'm not sure why 2029 is on the list, so someone else should talk about that.

538
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,840
Uh I just wanted to say I volunteered for Dublin in 2029.

539
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:40,980
Are you running their Discord?

540
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,700
No, I'm helping with the style guide.

541
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,020
Oh

542
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,180
So d do I need to tell Claire to listen to this episode?

543
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,940
I mean, mm, don't know.

544
00:36:53,100 --> 00:37:01,900
But like I mean Claire is someone I've talked to a lot about style guides and large amounts of my opinions on style guides come from Claire, because Claire is wise, unlike some people.

545
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,780
But yeah, I did the Luncon 3 style guide.

546
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,940
So, um, I mean not all of it.

547
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,060
I'm much more interested, or interested maybe the wrong word.

548
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,460
I think I've got more to contribute on the

549
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:20,740
um style of writing than I have stuff like the colours used for branding and Pantone shades and all of that kind of thing.

550
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,380
Happy for someone else to do that because that's not my wheelhouse.

551
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,740
But um but yeah

552
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,380
I'll volunteer for that.

553
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,820
I'm in a little Discord channel.

554
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:33,700
Andrew January is doing the Dublin Discord and he knows more about he has forgotten more about Discord than I will ever know, so that is fine.

555
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,500
I agree that style guides are important for a Worldcon.

556
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,460
I think

557
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:45,160
What's really interesting is that when you start to bring a style guide together you end up having a lot of conversations that turn

558
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:54,420
You end up having a lot of philosophical conversations about things, not all of which are just like, oh, should we use double quotes in this circumstance?

559
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,620
You know, some of them are

560
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,040
much more profound than that, despite the fact that you'd think, huh, it's a style guide, why does that matter?

561
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,840
But they do, because they tell you things about what people actually think on quite a deep level, that's not just about punctuation.

562
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,600
Right, so would you like a free trip?

563
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:25,760
to Australia to go to Perth, SwanCon 50, which is also the Australian National Convention at the end of May, beginning of June.

564
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,600
Because if so, Guff has done a call for nominations and we would like at least two candidates, please.

565
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,880
And we've had to short all the deadlines this year because of

566
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,700
my executive function disorder.

567
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,140
And so yeah, you've got about um uh or a little bit more than a week after we

568
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,940
published to get your things together, which you could say you could definitely do.

569
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,620
And but it'll be great.

570
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,660
You'll have a great time.

571
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,780
It'll be marvellous.

572
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,820
There is a requirement to then administer the fund for a couple of years, but that's been pretty good really

573
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,339
And hopefully raise some money so that we can do it again.

574
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,220
But yeah, so I think this is a great year to go to Australia.

575
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,180
I think it's uh fabulous that SwanCon has got to fifty.

576
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:16,740
and that they're having a kind of because it's the NACCON, there'll be people from the east coast of Australia there as well, and also some people from abroad, including at least one former Goughwinner who is going back to her home country and will be help

577
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,560
Happy to help you out while you're there on your trip.

578
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,640
So um so please don't self-exclude if you're listening to this and think, oh I'm not really the right sort of person.

579
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
No, no, you definitely are.

580
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:32,940
Get your nominations in and all the information's on the website, which we will link to in the show notes.

581
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,180
And thanks as ever to Dave Langford for running a little website for us.

582
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:37,819
Yes.

583
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,900
God, I didn't realise you were running a race now for

584
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:42,820
June.

585
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,420
Yeah, no, no we are.

586
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,020
Because otherwise we don't.

587
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,140
And we've been not doing it for ages, so we're doing it.

588
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,540
And we might not get two candidates in Kitchkofe.

589
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,620
We probably can't run a race, so that would be a bit sad.

590
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,700
So we'd really, really like people to come forward.

591
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,820
Excellent.

592
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,540
Run for Guff.

593
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,220
The Transatlantic Fan Fund is having a race.

594
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:11,300
It was reported in Ansible number four hundred and sixty three that the ballot would be online soon and that was some strange use of the word soon I was previously unaware of.

595
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,420
Uh it is a week later.

596
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,380
There's not been a ballot.

597
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,540
There will be a ballot one day, presumably.

598
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,180
Probably before you're listening to this, I think.

599
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,860
One day civilization will resume and there we'll once again

600
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,840
Beat off ballots.

601
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,560
Yes.

602
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,640
Kat Templeton has announced on Blue Sky that she is one of the candidates for the race.

603
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,440
We don't know who the other candidates are.

604
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,880
Um but Kat's great, so vote for Kat, I guess.

605
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,640
Yay Kat.

606
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,400
I met her on my Taft trip.

607
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,040
We had pizza.

608
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,680
It was good.

609
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,160
Would you like to have pizza with people like John?

610
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,840
Or alternatively people like Kat?

611
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,440
Run for Taff.

612
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,160
Whoever wins TAF, I'm very happy to have pizza with you.

613
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,359
That sounds great.

614
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,079
Yes.

615
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,240
If I'm at MetropolCon, which LeJuria is not yet, because I've just bought SmothCon memberships, so we will be at SmovCon.

616
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,880
Did you buy full SmofCon memberships?

617
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:07,460
Yeah, I've bought two full SmofCon memberships and I've also chucked something in for the bursary because I feel like I can and I want the convo current convention to be a great success.

618
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,020
So and who knows, I might go to some other programme.

619
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,300
I might even be on this program.

620
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,580
I don't know.

621
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,100
Yeah, I just the only thing is I just have to not say yes at any point in the entire weekend.

622
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,060
Yay.

623
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,220
So when I say do you want a beer?

624
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,700
Yes, yes, one hundred percent

625
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,020
Shall we do picks?

626
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,059
Yes.

627
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:33,500
John, go first.

628
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,380
All right.

629
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,839
This is the rare movie franchise where the best films in the franchise appear to be the first and fourth entries.

630
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,160
It does happen, but it's not common.

631
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,600
Uh so this is twenty-eight years later the Bone Temple, which is written, as was the previous one by

632
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:59,780
uh Alex Garland so you know there's a certain level of quality employed there but in this case it is uh directed by Nia da Costa

633
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,220
instead of uh being directed by Danny Boyle.

634
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:10,500
It follows, it's a direct sequel to the previous movie, but I don't think you really need to have seen the previous movie to understand what is happening here.

635
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:16,820
I think there's one scene where you'd be able to piece it together um and the rest is basically fairly standalone.

636
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,700
So there is it's a story of how if

637
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,980
Your primary role model is Jimmy Savile.

638
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,380
That's unlikely to be a good benchmark of your wholesomeness as a person.

639
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,140
I think it's fair to say.

640
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:43,500
The baddie is Jimmy Crystal and he has a team of Jimmies and they all wear brightly coloured tracksuits and are just generally slight rotters.

641
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:45,559
It's all filmed in Northumbria.

642
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,279
It's all kind of beautiful landscapes and stuff.

643
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,319
And it's explicitly set in the Northeast as well, which is lovely.

644
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:54,440
And it is a rumination on

645
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:03,460
how our trauma shapes us and which parts of ourselves are beyond our control and which parts are not, I would say.

646
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,960
I thought it was amazing and it's definitely better than the first one.

647
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:09,640
Um I liked the first one, but the second one is is immense.

648
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:11,640
So yeah, highly recommend.

649
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,900
When you say the first one, you mean the first twenty-eight years later?

650
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,319
I

651
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,820
Twenty-eight years later, yeah.

652
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,260
They've just conf they've confused me.

653
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,900
You can't have twenty-eight days, then twenty-eight weeks, then twenty-eight years, then twenty-eight years two

654
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,420
You can and they have.

655
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,660
Look, it may be a great film, but if they had a style guide, this would not happen.

656
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,500
I walked after 28 months.

657
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:31,700
That's what I want to know.

658
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,020
Speaking of 28 years later

659
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:46,380
I I saw a picture of somebody using a tiny fake Nintendo Game Boy Advanced SP to play UFO 50, and I was like, oh, I want to be able to do that.

660
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:48,380
So I bought myself a tiny.

661
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,160
Fake.

662
00:43:49,560 --> 00:44:00,200
It's kind of like a Game Boy, as if a Game Boy had a decent screen and USB charging and lots of storage and um better buttons and

663
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:12,860
It's amazing and it's kind of Pokemon coloured and I have a photograph for you and I've managed to put UFO 50 on it so I'm quite pleased about that UFO50 being a game from 2024 that is also kind of retro

664
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:23,539
And I've also been playing a bunch of Game Boy games, like say Metroid Fusion, which is a game where you are, I guess, a

665
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:32,840
human in a battlesuit who's been unfortunately genetically modified by an alien parasite and it seems to be a very good game.

666
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,960
And retro games are very cool and I like them.

667
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,320
And this was all.

668
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,940
This is all very sudden, but this is my pick for the week.

669
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,300
Nintendo Game Boys.

670
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:46,100
Um when Alison says it is Pokemon colours, uh what she means is it's yellow.

671
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,220
No, no, no.

672
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,700
It's yellow, but it's got red buttons.

673
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,340
Oh

674
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,460
Yes, no, it does have red buttons, that is fair.

675
00:44:52,700 --> 00:45:05,420
So yeah, no, if if they'd had kind of a more I I I I I wanted the yellow one 'cause I kind of didn't buy um a different tiny yellow console that was extremely expensive and I kinda I've been I think that's probably the correct decision, but I've

676
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:14,940
Realized I wanted a tiny I have a switch, but I find the switch is a bit big for actually carrying around in your handbag so that you can kind of

677
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,600
Place gib little games whenever you have spare moment, but this is perfect.

678
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,640
Mm mm.

679
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,000
That's a good size.

680
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,840
It does look cool.

681
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,720
It is an An Bernick RG34XXSP.

682
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:24,600
P

683
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,880
Other other tiny little clamshells handheads are available.

684
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,800
This just happens to be the one that I bought.

685
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,000
Yes.

686
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,520
There is a link in the show notes, listeners, if you would like to purchase one.

687
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,800
Um I I got mine from Kex though, so

688
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:43,380
It uh says something about the future.

689
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:48,740
I know this isn't a tech podcast, but this console has had a RAM downgrade recently.

690
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,900
So if you buy it now, it won't have as much RAM as it did a year ago.

691
00:45:53,059 --> 00:46:03,059
Which doesn't matter if you're playing Nintendo Game Boy games which don't need any RAM, but it probably does matter if you're putting UFO fifty and other um reasonably recently released games on it.

692
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,299
I've never heard anyone use

693
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:07,819
Never heard anyone actually pronounced keks.

694
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,260
So that was like pretty feel like, what on earth is Alison talking about?

695
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:16,059
I know, I know, I just don't I just really don't like uh there's a whole ps

696
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:21,300
chunk of stuff in the computer exchange style guide that I don't approve of.

697
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,980
Yeah, no that's fair.

698
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:29,540
But I do I mean when you when you phone up when you phone them up they say hello, you've reached the sex help line, which is fair.

699
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,500
It it's it's sort of yeah.

700
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,100
Is it a good joke?

701
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:34,980
No one knows.

702
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,260
I don't think so.

703
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,180
No, I don't think it is either.

704
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,860
Liz, I've forgotten what your pick is.

705
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:46,140
Well obviously this is the the first thing I have ever picked and given.

706
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:53,220
If presented with the evidence that I have picked things in the past, then I will just be very confused and denial knowledge.

707
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:59,860
I'm picking a book called There Is No Anti-Mimetics Division by Quantum.

708
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,580
Although it's quantum with no vowels.

709
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,340
Anyway.

710
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,260
So this is a book a set so it's really interesting.

711
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,020
So there is a basically a

712
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:19,300
shared universe collaborative writing project called the SCP Foundation and it's kind of all a big fictional setting about

713
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:28,220
A secret organization, a bit like basically if there was a branch of the government, although it's not a a lie to any government, I think, that investigates essentially

714
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,400
weird, paranormal, and supernatural phenomena.

715
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,880
I mean I think there's a huge wiki of stuff that very few people have dug through.

716
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,040
There's an kind of enormous amount of this stuff, but I think two key things have come out of it.

717
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:47,579
Um and one of them is this novel, There is No Anti Memetics Division, which is about the division of this organization that works on

718
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:56,420
anti-memes, basically, what if there were paranormal supernatural organisms out there which are attacking us

719
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,600
essentially through our memories.

720
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,160
And it's such a great high concept idea.

721
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,360
And the novel really I think takes it all the way through.

722
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:14,880
You know, and I'm sure this did start off as like a great uh short piece, like that the introduction is about um essentially someone being called into their boss's office.

723
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:22,020
For for their boss to say, I don't know who you are, I've never seen you, I've never heard of you before, and them going, No, no, no, we've had this conversation, you know, twenty times before.

724
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,220
And then it just but it goes on to spawn a whole novel out of it.

725
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:26,740
And I think a lot of it is

726
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:33,099
the novelty of reading it and going, Oh, that's such an amazing way to kind of go through this idea and build it out.

727
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,380
But there is kind of a human story in there as well.

728
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:39,740
How do you fight against a being where

729
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:48,119
if you ever remember what you've done, you will lose and kind of the human told that takes on people

730
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,260
I really enjoyed it.

731
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:56,380
I think it it began as a wiki piece and I think it has now been picked up for publication and substantially rewritten.

732
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:59,660
And so it's not uh explicitly an SCP story anymore.

733
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,140
I

734
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:01,740
But yes, uh so I really enjoyed it.

735
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:09,260
I even went to the point of actually going back and finding the wiki entries and reading some of the earlier versions of the story 'cause it has been substantially

736
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:14,620
edited and I think improved and now I just want to go and read more of the books of Quantum.

737
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
The other kind of SCP

738
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:24,140
foundation style thing is the game control um for PlayStation which I also really enjoyed.

739
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,820
I have that on

740
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,420
on my shelf, but I have not played it yet.

741
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:35,060
I will link to the Antimimetics FAQ in the show notes because people did ask him kind of some of the

742
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:42,380
Some of the some questions about what he had changed and stuff and some of the conversation about that is uh quite interesting.

743
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:48,380
Um it is ROT13 encoded, uh which is a blast from the past and no mistake.

744
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,660
Um but yeah.

745
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:55,740
And no, this is this is the best book I have read for ages.

746
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,420
I really enjoyed it.

747
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,460
And I think

748
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,880
It is a book I've been recommending to people and most of the people I've recommended it to have also enjoyed it.

749
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,800
My friend Bella finished it in like three days.

750
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,320
But yeah, I I I really loved it.

751
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,640
I think Liz is right that it takes it all the way through in really interesting ways.

752
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,980
I also think it's deeply unsettling.

753
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:20,940
I don't think it's outright I don't think it's like I don't think it's jump scare scary, but like I found it very unsettling.

754
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,420
So yeah, I really enjoyed it.

755
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,859
It reminds me of when the laundry files were good.

756
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:35,140
Yeah, I was gonna say it's very reminiscent of like the first time I read like the Atrocity Archives in the Concrete Jungle and you had that oh this is such a brilliant idea.

757
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,220
Yeah.

758
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:37,140
This concept is just great.

759
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,980
But twenty-eight novels later.

760
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:49,539
Well, when he started doing the new management, that was when I found I was just like I don't want to re um this became zany in a way that I don't find compelling anymore.

761
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,060
Like I I yeah, I think they lost some.

762
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:52,780
That's it.

763
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,620
I don't I don't think I want to read another twenty novels about this.

764
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,380
I think it is a really

765
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:05,640
It comes in, it does its thing, it doesn't outstay its welcome, but there is enough meaty stuff in there to make it a full blown novel.

766
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,520
Yorp.

767
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,320
Indeed.

768
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,920
Yeah, so y'all go and read it.

769
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,400
John approved and Liz approved, and how often does that happen?

770
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,400
I mean, relatively often.

771
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,039
Yeah.

772
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,799
Quite a bit actually, yeah.

773
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:16,680
Yeah.

774
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,039
Quite often.

775
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,279
I've put an ROT thirteen decoder in the uh in the show notes listeners.

776
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:29,620
Oh good, because I no longer have one installed in my browser by default because it's not two thousand and five.

777
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:30,500
Yep.

778
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:31,380
Oh.

779
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:36,420
I Okay, so I still you know services in Apple Mac where you can get things on right click.

780
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,740
I've got ROT thirteen as one of those.

781
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:45,839
I used to, but like Liz, I it has been long enough that I have um no longer.

782
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,599
I I do a lot of I do a lot of kind of puzzles and things and there's still a lot a lot of rock thirteen there.

783
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,000
Uh Mod 13 is still very, very useful for the things it's useful for.

784
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:55,880
Mm.

785
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:04,200
Unfortunately we I mean I I guess a lot of websites have spoiler have actual spoiler tags and things now, so they

786
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,800
They manage it automatically.

787
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:11,640
No, I'm I'm pretty sure I've never used ROT13 before, so that was the Ultra Thought Podcast.

788
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,920
And it's goodbye from me.

789
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,599
It's goodbye from me.

790
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,200
And it's goodbye from me.

791
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,940
Have you been making anti-mimetics jokes for the entire podcast, John?

792
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,779
I don't remember.

793
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:43,700
Cause I thought it was memento.

794
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:45,380
Oh yeah, no, it wasn't memento.

795
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,579
But uh that would also work.

796
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,660
I assumed it was memento because I thought you did films at the beginning of the podcast.

797
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:51,800
I do all sorts of things.

798
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,560
I'm not constrained.

799
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,880
I feel like we got back on track.

800
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,680
I'm sorry about that.

801
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:59,160
Hopefully it's all in Audacity.

802
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,920
There we go.

803
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:06,640
Yeah, just we just gotta hope that your audio problems haven't bang jaxed us.

804
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,480
But I'm sure it'll be fine.

805
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:13,940
The theme music for this episode was Fanfare for Space by Kevin McLeod in CompTech.

Beep.
