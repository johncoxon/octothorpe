1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:06,160
Uh this is backfired because I assumed that Alison would remember and that I do remember, I just forgot.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,640
Ha!

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,800
Right.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,920
You can't say I do remember I just forgot, unless you are redefining the concept of forgetting.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:35,040
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 149th episode of the Octothorpe Podcast

6
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:43,420
Which is realizing that all its neighbours are going around the block on an endless loop on the 4th of December 2025.

7
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,780
I'm John Coxon.

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,260
I'm Alison Scott.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,620
And I'm Liz Batty.

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,380
Yeah, thanks to everyone who sent us photographs of our live show.

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,980
We really appreciate it.

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,500
And if you took any and you didn't send them to us, please send them to us.

13
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,940
We would very much appreciate it.

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,380
Yeah, we love photos.

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,300
But we did use a photo taken by Steve because, you know, nepotism or whatever.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,460
I say we I had nothing to do with that.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,260
I was on holiday.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,500
Yeah y yeah, we took a photo we took some photos in the lobby and we used one of them in the end.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,900
Um but th but the background was so terrible I had to cut it out.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,900
So we we maybe could have thought that through a little bit better.

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,380
To get us started, we have some letters of comments.

22
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:30,820
So we heard from Karen Schaefer who linked us to an interesting

23
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,900
thing in Ars Technica.

24
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:43,300
Basically there's a New Zealand conference of hackers and they've put live CO2 monitoring in all of the conference rooms and I thought this was quite cool

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,700
So yeah, we'll link it in the show notes.

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,540
Don't have a lot to add, but it's neat.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,900
Thanks for writing in Karen.

28
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,780
Oh yes, the network the mall.

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,740
I think that's quite cool.

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,860
It is, it's neat.

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,700
I mean it would be cool if

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,640
It would be cool if this became the standard in modern conference centers.

33
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,320
I don't know if it will, but it would be neat.

34
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,320
Yeah, I'd be no Alison shaking her head.

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:09,160
I I agree, I don't think it probably will because it costs money and and stuff, but and also because as we discovered in Chicago

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:22,260
it's all fine on Thursday and then it gradually gets worse over the weekend and there's not that much you can do about it except for spending a lot of money to do the thing that really costs money, which is sorting your filtration out once and for all

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,640
Yes.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:31,200
What we could link then we are what we need also is like real-time toilet monitoring of various virus levels in the sewage of the convention.

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,080
Yes

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,640
And Liz could put in the grant.

41
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:43,880
Because, you know, I think it's all good well and good to have CO2 monitoring, but there is another like very human factor, which is if you have super high CO2 but no one in that room has a respiratory virus, then

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,800
you won't be transmitting it, right?

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,160
It is a proxy for that.

44
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,880
But it also depends very much on the density of people, you know, spewing out particles into the atmosphere, which we don't know.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,680
But if you monitored the toilets, maybe we would

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,120
Yeah, I mean I I'm I get very worried by the concept of toilet monitoring in general at the moment, but that does sound like a plausible thing.

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
Can you do this in real time, Liz?

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,880
Can you get your toilet

49
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,739
Tullet results fast enough to affect the convention as it's happening.

50
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,060
You you can't be doing it at the moment directly in real time, I guess, but you can do it.

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,680
Pretty quickly.

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,320
You could be like sampling every hour and testing it and get a result a couple of hours later.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,000
But anyway, it's not really it's not quite feasible, but it's not far off feasible.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,560
I have a whole plan for my next Eastercon newsletter theme.

55
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,280
Oh, I have a plan for my next Eastercon newsletter theme too.

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,440
It's dangerous 'cause I don't want to run another Eastercon newsletter, but you know Ah, I'm doing next year's, so would you like to help?

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Um anyway we could call it Concrud.

58
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:48,500
Paul Weimar wrote to us um riffing off my mention of the VNAE storehouse to recommend the central

59
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:58,060
Montmartini in Rome that he visited in 2015 after the city of Rome decided that they had too much stuff in storage and decided to convert an old power plant.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,200
display some of it.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,280
He says it's about as unique a place as I've seen I've seen art as I've ever been.

62
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,560
And I think if I go to Rome I'll definitely check that out, Paul.

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,440
Thank you.

64
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,660
Rome is pretty great.

65
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,820
I went on a school trip once and it it's yeah, it's good.

66
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,340
There should be a WorldCon there.

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,620
Hold it in the Coliseum!

68
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,860
It'd have great ventilation though.

69
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,900
Yeah, it would

70
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,460
Well and also Italy in August, you don't need to be in z well, I suppose air conditioning might be quite good, actually.

71
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,600
Low ventilation and maybe also lions.

72
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:42,120
We heard from Emily January, who correctly pointed out that when we were discussing Chinese cons wanting to achieve the scale of WorldCon, we should probably consider that they are talking about the scale of the Chengdu WorldCon, which was giant.

73
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,280
And not maybe the scale of like European or even US WorldComs, which are still much smaller.

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
It's difficult to tell, right?

75
00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:05,540
Because like I spoke to someone at an Easter Con whose dad is Chinese and so they went to uh the Chengdi WorldCon as a punter rather than as like one of the Western fans who has flown over on behalf of the Chinese government.

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,360
And their review of the WorldCom was that if you were Chinese, it was really not very good compared to other Chinese conventions.

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,759
So I don't have a good sense for how

78
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,860
how much people in China are discussing how much they want to be like that WorldCon.

79
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:28,419
I I I very much from the reporting thought they meant WorldCon in the sense of the international cachet of WorldCon, not that specific event.

80
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
But maybe I am wrong.

81
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,680
Um but I didn't interpret size necessarily to mean people so much as influence.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,560
Well Emily also goes on to say they may be talking about like the number of international attendees, not necessarily size as well.

83
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,180
Yeah, yeah, it could be.

84
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,539
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

85
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,819
But it does seem just given the size of regular conventions in China that you'd probably be aiming for something on a pretty big scale.

86
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,580
Andreas DeVauer wrote and said, Listening to the latest podcast episode, I started to wonder about Irish Fandom Day.

87
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,140
What happened on that day that made it special?

88
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,820
Did you mention it?

89
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,100
Did we mention it?

90
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,140
This was m

91
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,900
Multiple episodes ago, I don't remember.

92
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,660
I'm pretty sure we did, yes.

93
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,260
Sorry, uh it's the day that Walt Willis met Thingy, you said.

94
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,380
James White?

95
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,500
Yes.

96
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:23,960
In the summer of nineteen forty-seven, the Willises discovered um a copy of Astounding and then a copy of The Prozine Fantasy.

97
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,720
in the letter section was a missive from Belf a Belfast fan, one James White.

98
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,479
White j Willis wrote to White, White replied on the twenty-sixth of August, and that day

99
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:43,840
was thereafter known as Irish Fandom Day because it was the first time two science fiction fans in Ireland had met.

100
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,500
So the day of the founding of Irish science fiction fandom.

101
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:54,780
And I don't know whether other countries have fandom days, but I know that Caroline is looking to

102
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:05,260
generate something for the hundredth anniversary of British fandom, which started after a small advertisement was put in a newspaper

103
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,580
to form a local group in Ilford in I think nineteen thirty.

104
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,460
Somebody write in.

105
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,180
Andreas also says for something completely different, SmovCon.

106
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,660
When attending SweeCon and the program item on coming events I asked about virtual memberships for SmofCon

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,440
Apparently they've decided against it because they didn't have the technology available.

108
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:31,120
And yes, there is an argument that SmothCons should be about modelling best practice, and um I will leave that argument to the imagination of the reader.

109
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,900
I I think we've had this argument before in previous years.

110
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:42,620
I think it is interesting that s there are some small conventions with an international audience that do manage to stream, though possibly not very well.

111
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:50,980
because they think that the the benefit of having people in virtually is worth it, even if the streaming's not perfect.

112
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:53,860
We also heard from Christopher J.

113
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,900
Garcia.

114
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,820
He says Buckaroo Bonseye is the smartest movie ever made, which is definitely a sentence.

115
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,140
He's a man of bold opinions, is Chris, isn't he?

116
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,700
Yep.

117
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,500
He's not afraid to take polarizing stances.

118
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,140
Just him versus the rest of fandom.

119
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,660
Yes.

120
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,780
Um, and he also comes back to his belief that we need more Hugos and longer ceremonies.

121
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,140
No.

122
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,940
No one's emailed him with their favourite Hugo categories yet, so come on people.

123
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,020
Oh, he suggested three.

124
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,680
Oh that's true.

125
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:27,479
He did.

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,279
Spoilers, I'm not sure we're gonna pick any of them in our draft, but we might, who knows?

127
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,120
Well if no one said there's any others, then we're gonna pick him in our draft, so

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,480
Oh but we've all we've we've got all of the ones that have all like are actually real as well.

129
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,600
So that's tricky.

130
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,120
Oh I see.

131
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:47,380
Chris also tells us he's designing a Hugo base.

132
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,180
Um it's going to be mid-century modern.

133
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,779
Um and I'm I'm up for that.

134
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,100
And he said the most beautiful Hugo ever was objectively the LA Con Trophy from 2006.

135
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,780
I didn't win that one, um, but that's the best one.

136
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:08,900
And uh it's interesting 'cause that is the third one that I have, apart from my first Hugo for Plocter and my first Hugo for Octhorpe.

137
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,740
And it is very beautiful, Hugo

138
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,780
But it's not my favourite.

139
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,100
Yeah, I was gonna say, doesn't Alison have one of those?

140
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,700
Yeah, I do have one of those.

141
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,700
Um and when she auctions it, Chris can bid.

142
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,420
Yeah, that's right.

143
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,620
And that's the one that I might auction for the fan funds.

144
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,959
Mmm mmm.

145
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,800
Don't hold your breath, guys.

146
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,519
Because people keep going up well you can't do that, you can't do that.

147
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,199
It's just tough.

148
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,720
Look, I'm I think famously the least sentimental of us about stuff and you will pry my Hugo from my Call Dead Hands.

149
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,760
That is fair.

150
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,760
Yes, that is how it works.

151
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,540
But and now we know for the first time that Liz will be buried with her Hugo um in a pyramid.

152
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:56,340
Oh no okay, now I have an art concept of my burial pyramid.

153
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,200
No, three barrel pyramids, you're good.

154
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,640
With Hugo's on top.

155
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,320
They'll have various things.

156
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,760
We also had a I would say reasonably niche tweet from Ed Moreland

157
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:14,760
Uh how about instead of sending me to Southeast Asian Conventions, we have an ox talk trip to a cyclocross race to properly appreciate Belgian culture.

158
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,880
I am thoroughly in favour of this

159
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:29,680
Um if you are not aware of the sport of cyclocross, it's a winter sport in which men and women ride bikes round a circuit in the mud and there's lots of beer drinking and cheering for your favourite riders and there's lots of them in Belgium.

160
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,380
and the Netherlands and so on over the Christmas period.

161
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,580
So yeah, maybe we need an octetop trip to the Cyclocross.

162
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,420
I'd like to um

163
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,620
Acknowledge everyone who wrote in with famous Belgians.

164
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,860
Please stop.

165
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:53,980
Yeah, I think this is why we we do not properly appreciate Belgian culture and therefore we must go to one of the most Belgian things possible, which is drinking beer at bike race.

166
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,140
I am 100% up for going to Belgium to drink beer.

167
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,420
I'm not entirely sure about Cyclocross, but eh.

168
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,480
I will say that um I do like the movie uh In Bruges.

169
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,080
Oh, you've said that before.

170
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,200
It's a good movie.

171
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,600
And Colin Farrell is one of my favourite famous Belgians.

172
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,660
We also heard He's not Belgian, is he?

173
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:26,980
We also heard from Ed Moreland, uh, who said that he can confirm something about Trinity Math Mose, which I'm assuming a mathematician with mustaches.

174
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,220
And just mathematicians.

175
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,180
I th we didn't use this phrase when Look, you got your mathos and your Natskies done.

176
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:40,860
We didn't use we didn't call 'em mathmos when I was there, so that's a that's a a term of art that has appeared in the last two hundred and seventy-six years.

177
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:51,340
I'm gonna say that we we appreciate uh Ed's defence of the Trinity Math Mos, but also last episode had way too much weird Cambridge talk.

178
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,779
I was expecting that to get cut out.

179
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,220
John said he was going to cut it out, and then it did not get cut out.

180
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:07,640
I did actually cut a couple of sentences out, but it was difficult to find a good place that wouldn't make no sense at all.

181
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,920
And did you put my sponsor read in last time, John?

182
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,800
Yes.

183
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,160
Oh, okay, well the needle hasn't moved.

184
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:14,720
Oh.

185
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,040
Maybe we should do another one this time.

186
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
Interesting.

187
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,399
No, but but someone bought a hoodie.

188
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
Yeah, we've we've sold some things.

189
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,040
Yay!

190
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,580
Thank you to the listener ball the hoodie, you know who you are.

191
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,980
And we know who you are, but yeah, thank you.

192
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:42,800
The SmothCon Q<unk>A's uh have gone up and um for those who are not quite as plugged in

193
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
Oh no, the different way of putting it.

194
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,720
For those who don't refresh uh smofcom42.

195
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,720
com as obsessively as us.

196
00:12:51,079 --> 00:13:00,920
Effectively, upcoming WorldCon bids will answer a question and answer form that the SmoFcon has um put on the internet.

197
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:08,920
and this gets you a chance to see what's coming up in the world of worldcons and also what their answers to these questions are.

198
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,140
And for those who don't know, SmothCon is a convention for conrunners.

199
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,060
Um, so uh I'll put a link in the show notes.

200
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:29,160
Um, but you have to answer, or you don't have to answer, but the Q<unk>A is it's about 40 questions long and different bids have filled it in, and some are the usual suspects and some are

201
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,760
Perhaps more interesting and newsworthy.

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,760
So at the time of recording, the WorldCom bids that have submitted Q<unk>A's are

203
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:46,260
Edmonton in 2030, Montreal in 2027, Kigali in 2028, and Dublin in 2029.

204
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,020
We knew all of those were

205
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,160
extant bids or cons, and so those are not too surprising.

206
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,200
But there's a couple of new ones.

207
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,840
There's Nuremberg in twenty twenty eight, uh, and there's Glasgow in twenty thirty-four.

208
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,880
And so we

209
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,579
are going to discuss the two new kids on the block.

210
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:04,300
Hmm.

211
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,899
And possibly the kids on the block who have not submitted answers.

212
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:14,100
Yeah, there are other World Compers that have not submitted, which is Although it is five days before SmovCon, so they might just not have done it.

213
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,860
I mean the idea of this is

214
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:24,080
You there is like a future WorldCons presentation at SmovCon and the idea is that if you put all the like tedious questions like

215
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,980
like or what airlines fly to your city.

216
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,940
Well no they're not too, but you know, the the boilerplate things like how many airlines fly to your city, what is the cost, what is your roommate's gonna be?

217
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:38,460
You put all this in a document and then you don't need to spend quite so much time at the actual Q<unk>A asking them questions about like airports.

218
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:47,640
Yeah, so looking through the list of people who gave talks at the SmovCon last year

219
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:55,600
The missing ones are Texas in 2031 have not yet submitted a document, but as we say, there is still time.

220
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:05,980
Um and last year there was a Vince Doherty said that there was a group of people in the Netherlands who were investigating a Dutch WorldCon in 2032.

221
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:10,259
Um, I believe that is no longer a going concern, but I might be wrong.

222
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,819
If anyone has any concrete information, do write in.

223
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,579
And there has also been rumbling.

224
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:23,240
from Polish fandom about bidding for mid-2030s, I think 2035, and I don't see a Q<unk>A from them either.

225
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:36,880
So um that might be that they just haven't done it yet because as I say it's not the deadline and we're just we're constrained by recording schedules listeners, so don't take this as a sign that these conventions are a sort of behind the curve necessarily.

226
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:45,460
But uh yes, difficult to tell whether that's because they're no longer going concerns or they're just not that far ahead in their planning or whether they just haven't submitted it yet.

227
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,580
No way to tell.

228
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,779
Yeah, so we will we will get back to this.

229
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:54,140
You know, if there are if there is stuff that comes out later we will get back to it when we have more reports from SmothCon.

230
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,300
And we'll have a reporter on the ground at Smovcon, won't we, John?

231
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:10,440
John, you must go to SmophCon and bring us back the finest informations and gossips you can acquire, which I am absolutely sure you will, and we don't need to podcast all of it, but some of it

232
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,520
I will indeed endeavour to do that.

233
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Yes, I am off to SmovCon.

234
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,040
I'd like to thank Glasgow 2024 for a travel bursary which will

235
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,840
cover part of my travel hotel and keep me in crumpets for the duration.

236
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,080
And um I've never been before, so I'm excited to see what it's all about.

237
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,740
I have massive FOMO about SmovCon though.

238
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:36,339
I don't want to go to SmovCon because I no good can come of it, right?

239
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,019
You're gonna end up with work.

240
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,339
I want a couple of panels.

241
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,900
Oh god I've been put on an extra panel.

242
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,180
Why?

243
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,420
Why why is there a new panel?

244
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,300
Did you know?

245
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,500
No, I did not know.

246
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,500
What panels are you gonna be doing, John?

247
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,060
Well, okay, so the two I had seen that I was going to tell the listeners about were at 3 p.

248
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,300
m.

249
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,740
Central European Time, I will be on a panel called Socialising at Online Conventions.

250
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,880
And uh I'll be on with Andrew and Emily January, who are also experts on this topic.

251
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,559
And Constanza Hoffman is moderating and Michelle Morel is the other panelist

252
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,600
Uh 12 noon on the Sunday, I will be on the World Situation and WorldCon, which will be interesting.

253
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,560
Tammy Coxson is the moderator, and I'm uh joined by Brian Nisbitt, Emily Arrow, and Michael Kabunga.

254
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,440
And then the one I've just found out that I've been added to.

255
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:38,160
At noon on Saturday, I'm on a panel moderated by Heidi Leichel with Anouk, Arnal, Bruce Farr and Vinga

256
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,260
called Learning from Better Mistakes about Convention Problem Solving.

257
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,580
You've been put on that because of Zookon.

258
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:44,900
Yeah.

259
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,540
Shall we talk about Nuremberg first?

260
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,220
Yes, because we don't have a lot to say about them do with do we

261
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,680
Um I don't know.

262
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,520
There's a 37 page slideshow, so there's quite there's quite a lot to discuss.

263
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:07,580
I mean if you're gonna I think if you're gonna come out of stealth like what, eight months before you need to win the bid, then uh you gotta come out of the gate running.

264
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,320
Yeah, and they two do appear to have done so.

265
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:20,640
Um so Nuremberg in 2028 is being um co-chaired uh by Florian Bailey and Ruben Vickenhauser

266
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,040
Uh my sincere apologies if I pronounced those wrong.

267
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
Do you know either of these people?

268
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,400
Um I think I've heard of Florian Bailey.

269
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,280
I don't know them personally, but they are they are both fans in Germany.

270
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,880
So that's good.

271
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,440
Um

272
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,520
And, you know, one of them has a hat.

273
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,160
So um so one of them has been running a

274
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:59,240
tech festival in Nuremberg, which doesn't seem to be from the segment of German fandom that we interact with as much, like it seems to be a slightly different variety of convention to your Worldcons usually.

275
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,560
um but has been running for 15 years and have had guests like Charlie Stross, Bruce Sterling and Teresa Hanick.

276
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,040
And the other person is

277
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,799
Very involved in a sport called Jugger.

278
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,640
Which I know nothing about.

279
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,080
Me neither.

280
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,720
So he appears to be an author, but

281
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,400
He yeah, he is establishing jugger in schools and youth clubs in Sweden and Germany.

282
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,640
And yeah, I don't know what jugger is either.

283
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:35,260
And he's an experienced YouTuber, so he's got a YouTube channel that focuses on science fiction and jugger.

284
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,100
I've I've just googled Jugger, obviously, and it involves a skull.

285
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:50,740
It's not a real skull, but it's a bowl that looks like a skull and some kind of pyramid and a bit like LARP and you can like have a staff and hit people maybe

286
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,799
I want to play Jugger.

287
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,559
Traditional timekeeping.

288
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,160
Done with a gong and a hundred stones.

289
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,280
I love that we read that out at the same time, Liz.

290
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,260
We have both reached that point, yes.

291
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,060
Um, okay.

292
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,380
So this is a film I have never heard of.

293
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,380
Yeah, so it's based on a film.

294
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,020
Yeah.

295
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,660
Yep

296
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,500
This is as if somebody had a Quidditch league.

297
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:17,899
Yes, but this actually looks like it could be a real sport because Quidditch is just rugby with sticks.

298
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,019
Yes.

299
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,900
But this also as well as a skull, this also has weapons.

300
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,380
Um, a staff, a q-tip, a long sword, a short sword.

301
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,280
A chain.

302
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,800
Yeah, it's a team is composed of the five- eight following persons, five of which are allowed on the field.

303
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,240
A quick, an unarmed player, and the only one allowed to touch the skull.

304
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,820
Maximum one chain, a player armed with a chain.

305
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:51,460
Three or, if no chain, four enforcers, armed with their choice of weapon, except chain, and up to three substitutes.

306
00:20:51,360 --> 00:21:02,080
Right, well, I'm gonna say I am definitely gonna go and check out the Nuremberg uh people's uh YouTube channel, but not for the science fiction content, because I want to see someone actually playing a game of jogger.

307
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:11,440
And also, Liz, what we do now know that we need to do is um we need to for the next Octothorpe bonus episode uh watch the salute of the jugger.

308
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,640
You have just sniped me because I was like we are all watching this movie and then

309
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,360
We are gonna talk about it.

310
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,000
One hundred percent.

311
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,560
It's got Ruckkahwa.

312
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,880
Yes, yes it does.

313
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,280
I think we can all agree we're very excited about Nureberg, primarily for the Jugger content.

314
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,320
I have checked Rotten Tomatoes on The Blood of Heroes, which is the Jugger movie.

315
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,980
And it has a 20% tomato meter rating and a 76% popcorn meter rating.

316
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,940
So it is a f

317
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,180
fan favourite.

318
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,540
That is quite a uh quite a disparity, isn't it?

319
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,900
And there are 10 critic reviews and 2,500 user reviews.

320
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,500
Or ratings.

321
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,340
This will be interesting.

322
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,260
Can we possibly do this another time and get on with the podcast?

323
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,980
They intend to launch their bid

324
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:12,280
Announce their finance chairs, do their budget planning, have a website and confirm additional department heads and swag in January 2026.

325
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:20,720
And they're going to have a Bavarian party at the LA WorldCon, but they're also, and this is very interesting, they're taking a leaf out of the Chengdu playbook.

326
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:30,840
Because they say voting ticket support for students, which I assume means that they are going to help German students join the LA WorldCon so they can vote for this bid, which is what Chengdu did.

327
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,160
And now there will be an argument because there are a lot of people who are like, well the reason you don't like Chengdu doing it is because you're racist against the Chinese.

328
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,080
And now if a European World Con does it

329
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:46,080
Maybe we can have that discussion without having to keep caveating the fact that it's not because they're Chinese, it's because we don't like it.

330
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,799
It's tricky because I'd love to see a neurobell worldcon, I'd love to see a German WorldCon, but I'm not.

331
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm not sure I want to see a German WorldCon that isn't really a WorldCon and like that's hard.

332
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:03,920
I wonder and I'd be curious what like German fandom who is running the Metropolcon Eurocon next year.

333
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,420
and or the German fans who come to Eastcons and Worldcons.

334
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,700
I wonder what they think of this bid.

335
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,740
That will be interesting to see.

336
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,940
Right in.

337
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,740
The people who are running this bid are going to be at small

338
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,600
Where I am sure there will be many conversations on this topic.

339
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:26,640
They are planning to run their WorldCon the week after the aforementioned arts nerdy arts festival that one of them runs.

340
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,720
So it would kind of f seamlessly butt up against that.

341
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,640
And they may not have very much con running experience but they have

342
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:44,220
put together a perfectly cromular presentation, I would say, and there are plenty of WorldCons that seem to be incapable of that, so I think that's quite good.

343
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,060
You know, I don't want to I don't want to dismiss them out of hand, but I do think we have a little bit of an uphill struggle then.

344
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:55,100
But you know, they're against Kigali in Brisbane, so maybe not as much of an uphill struggle as it might be.

345
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,520
Yes, this is basically what Chengdu it did, right?

346
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,160
Identify a year where the competition is relatively weak.

347
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,280
No offense Brisbane.

348
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,560
No offense Kigali.

349
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,580
uh and throw money at the problem until you have a worldcom.

350
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,140
Which is a way of running a WorldCon that does work.

351
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,660
We've seen it work at least once.

352
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,580
So if they want to do it they can.

353
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,200
So they plan it around this twenty twenty eight Neuromeric Digital Festival, uh happening before, which can be good and bad, right?

354
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,480
If your organizers are in in both, then that could be a problem.

355
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,520
But I mean if that

356
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,060
It seems like that runs every year, so potentially they could bounce to another year if necessary.

357
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,580
Most, I think, first-time startup WorldCom bids have not.

358
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,220
won recently, and so they might need a second second go round.

359
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,860
But I mean they've put together a presentation that makes Nuremberg look really nice.

360
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,660
The city becomes a WorldCon Beer Garden

361
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,980
Yeah, I mean I'm not not up for that.

362
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,460
Hm.

363
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,660
What they mean is we can't drink at the conference centre in the evening, so we're going to go into town and drink there.

364
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,340
Seems plausible.

365
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,140
Maybe.

366
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,580
I mean that's basically what happens at every WorldCom, right?

367
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,300
And they do say they've both been to WorldCon before.

368
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:10,540
Yeah, and they say they've been to uh specifically they're thinking about this at Helsinki, and Helsinki is one of those where a lot of stuff went into the city kind of at night.

369
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:20,360
um away from the convention centre, but that was hampered by the distance and it sounds like the Nuremberg Conference Centre is much closer to the centre.

370
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,360
Of town.

371
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:21,760
Yeah.

372
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,440
I mean Nuremberg's lovely.

373
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,320
I have never been.

374
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,040
Me neither.

375
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,760
Sounds nice.

376
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,560
I would like to go.

377
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,080
I mean, I I I have not been there.

378
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,400
But it is it's known to be Oh, sorry

379
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,420
Is that when you said Nuremberg's lovely, I assumed you were speaking because you had been to Nuremberg and not because you have also looked on the internet.

380
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,820
No, I'm speaking talking out my hat.

381
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,900
But it's a famous place that's worth going to.

382
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,860
And it's in Bavaria, which is full of lovely places.

383
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,039
So we bit of kill John.

384
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,840
That's Nuremberg.

385
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,320
So yeah, um some open questions.

386
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,840
I think I think I am I I think we should come back to this question of

387
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:02,300
How do you mobilize people in your country who want to be involved without making it seem like you're taking over by Fiat?

388
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,220
Because I I do think

389
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,860
Like, I do think that a lot of the reaction against Chengdu's win was racism.

390
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,100
But I think a lot of it was also this isn't how we want people to go about winning these things.

391
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,140
And if Nuremberg is planning to do a similar thing

392
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:22,440
We probably do need to have a conversation about like, do we want this to be a thing people can do or do we not want it to be a thing people can do?

393
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,320
And what is it that we lose by allowing it or what is it that we gain by allowing it?

394
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,860
And at some point we should probably have that conversation, but maybe not today, because we've got other things to talk about.

395
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:39,700
I think you're off to SmothCon where I think everyone's going to have this conversation a lot all weekend and then you can come back with their informed views.

396
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,299
And we talk about it next time.

397
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,299
Shall we talk about Glasgow?

398
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:50,580
There's a Glasgow in twenty twelve thirty-four bid which has come out of like stealth biddy mode by announcing it in the SmothCon QA.

399
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,980
Uh I think they didn't do that last year, right?

400
00:26:53,260 --> 00:27:00,299
Uh all three of us knew it existed, so I guess we are less uh shocked and surprised, but we could pretend if you'd like.

401
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:00,940
What?

402
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,940
Glasgow's gonna have another world con.

403
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:03,740
What?

404
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,220
And and I mean I'm very pleased to see that they've come out of stealth bidding mode and now an official bid.

405
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,460
Um Meg, please take my money.

406
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,100
Um

407
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,200
Have they said how you can buy pre-supports?

408
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,799
I gave Meg a twenty.

409
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,600
Yeah.

410
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:16,919
Okay.

411
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,840
Well, Meg, when ya when I see you, you can have a twenty off me.

412
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,120
Can I have a pre-opposing bid

413
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,960
And my policy will be I will pay you money if you stop making vibrant food culture jokes.

414
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:35,320
Ah, now I will uh ask for a refund if you stop making vibrant food culture jokes.

415
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,380
I thought the vibrant food culture joke was very funny.

416
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,100
Yes.

417
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:48,500
So and this is um this is being um chaired the bid and sorry, the bid chair is Meg MacDonald.

418
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:56,240
who was one of the vice chairs for Glasgow in 2024 and there is a list of people who are um

419
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,220
involved or friendly towards the bid.

420
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,580
Weirdly, Liz isn't listed as explicitly hostile yet, but will be soon, presumably.

421
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,940
Yeah, that's fine.

422
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,200
You can list me as a pre a pose.

423
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,920
I'm not listed as friendly.

424
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,240
Well you haven't maybe you haven't been friendly enough.

425
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,920
But I hear that John Coxon is providing the bid with action support.

426
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,720
Yes.

427
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,200
I believe I said something like

428
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,880
Twenty thirty-four, fucking hell, that's ten years away.

429
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,640
Ask me in five years.

430
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,560
I mean that isn't unfair.

431
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,520
I don't work on world con timeframes, I don't think.

432
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,560
That's the problem.

433
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,600
Because the WorldCon timeframe now is like twelve years.

434
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,800
Basically as soon as you've finished a WorldCon you're thinking about the next one.

435
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,440
Yeah.

436
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,360
Oh, I think beforehand.

437
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,300
Ah, that's true, yeah.

438
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,140
You're probably thinking about it in twenty twenty three.

439
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,820
This is this is too much well con for me.

440
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,620
I'm like, no.

441
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:54,020
But I'm I I'd say they've got a bunch of people who are signed up to help the bid, all of whom are exactly the people you'd expect to be on that list and who are

442
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,240
pretty competent and a good ra mix of people from low local fandommen around the world.

443
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,280
And it's they're bidding for

444
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,400
The SEC again and they have provisionally booked the SEC for the likely dates.

445
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,640
I think that's that's kind of you'd think it would be locked in, wouldn't you?

446
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,460
I'll see you there.

447
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,260
Yep.

448
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:19,660
Um, yeah, no, it will be either the 3rd to the 6th of August or the 10th to the 13th of August, 2034.

449
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,700
It's tricky, right?

450
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,260
Because I don't have much to say other than yes.

451
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,040
Good.

452
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:35,240
Well there isn't there isn't a lot to say other than they're bidding for only thirty-four, they have a competent set of people, they have a potential venue and basically a lot of it is gonna be the same as last year.

453
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:42,480
Something something big could happen between now and twenty twenty nine, let alone twenty twenty twenty thirty four.

454
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,039
So

455
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:53,740
Um for now it's basically like it was nice last time, let's do it again, and I'm wholly in favour of that, but um I just can't get super excited until

456
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,760
It's within like a five year horizon.

457
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,520
I think I can get excited.

458
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,720
Get excited, John.

459
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,020
Get hype.

460
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:09,340
Basically, the 2024 was amazing and 2034 will also be amazing.

461
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,300
Glasgow's amazing.

462
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,420
Restaurants were amazing.

463
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,140
Unless it like gets it'll be great.

464
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,780
And also I can recycle all of the Glasgow Injoke ribbons that I had from twenty twenty four, so that's good too.

465
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,460
Did you buy too many ribbons, John?

466
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,820
Uh who amongst no, I bought the right number of ribbons.

467
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,020
Uh Knowing you would be able to recycle them in ten years' time.

468
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,700
And you'll be able to find them?

469
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,940
Yes, they live in the ribbon drawer, Liz.

470
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,460
They live in the ribbon tin in the miscellaneous things drawer.

471
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,340
I have nothing to say such organization, other than you only have one miscellaneous drawer.

472
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,500
Also, uh I think it's pr

473
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,960
I think it's probably appropriate to ask now, uh can we have an Octhorp Live?

474
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,520
Okay, so we're not taking that sabbatical then, John.

475
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,880
No, no, no, no, no.

476
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:53,539
No, no, we've got plenty of time.

477
00:30:53,620 --> 00:31:03,780
Look, we can have a sabbatical, we can have a vicious fight, we can never speak to each other for three years, we can reform and do another hundred and fifty episodes, and it will still only then be twenty thirty-four.

478
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
Also we should do all that.

479
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,520
Yes.

480
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,240
Really?

481
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,960
Okay, so who's up for the vicious fight then?

482
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,160
Should we schedule it in?

483
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,640
Yeah, let's schedule that one for 2027.

484
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
Babylon 5's a big pile of shit.

485
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,880
That's not gonna start it, is it?

486
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,600
Um no it's a sort of it's a reference, you see.

487
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,560
Oh god.

488
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,440
To what

489
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,280
To spaced.

490
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,760
Oh, which I should probably watch then.

491
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,440
Have you not watched spaced?

492
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,240
No.

493
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,400
Bloody hell.

494
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,660
You should watch spaced.

495
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:37,140
I know that we're going off topic again, but Yeah, but it's an important it's an important topic, which is that Alison hasn't watched spaced.

496
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,820
It's probably on uh Channel Four player or something.

497
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:44,539
I can watch it on Channel Four if I prepare to have eighteen minutes of adverts in a twenty-four minute show.

498
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:51,660
Once again, let's not turn this into the googling for where things are streaming in one country uh portion of the podcast.

499
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,140
I so I I guess yeah, just to wrap up on Glasgow, Meg's very capable.

500
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,620
Uh Glasgow's a great city to have a world call in.

501
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,980
It it also does I think it also does make sense to

502
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:10,140
kind of plan so that we've got kind of gaps between uh UK ones and Irish ones because they're not the same set of people but there are a bunch of people who do work on both.

503
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,620
or would like to work on both.

504
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,340
So not having them too close together does make sense.

505
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,820
Yeah, I I think this this model where we have a a a UK

506
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:26,960
convention uh work on each about every ten years and we have an Irish work on about every ten years is great as long as it goes on.

507
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,480
That suits me very well.

508
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,700
Do we want to talk a little bit about the other bids?

509
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,780
I confess I have only looked at the questionnaires.

510
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,380
From the two new bids.

511
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,660
I haven't looked at the old ones.

512
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,940
Have you looked at the old ones?

513
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,700
Is this something you might want again to report on after SmovCon, John?

514
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,880
I think there's not anything interesting in vid questionnaires usually, um, when we already know they exist.

515
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,720
Looking at the submitted QA responses, there's a gap between twenty thirty and twenty thirty-four.

516
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,360
We know Texas is provisionally

517
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:08,980
looking at 2031, but I don't know whether there's any rumblings for 32 or 33 yet.

518
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:15,300
So it'll be interesting to see if if any rumblings do kind of happen at SmothCon itself

519
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,760
Also notable that there's only one US bid in the mix still at the moment.

520
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,840
No others seem to be coming forward.

521
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,320
As it stands, it'll be US in 26, then Canada.

522
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:37,700
Then Australia, Rwanda or Germany, then Ireland, then Canada, then Texas, then a two-year gap, then Scotland.

523
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:45,000
And and what I would say is also in you know, there's three bids for twenty twenty eight and a two year gap in early twenty thirties, it seems like, if any of those bids

524
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,240
Don't make it and are happy to do so.

525
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,920
It's a good time to roll over to.

526
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,240
So we might end up with maybe maybe there'll be one US bid.

527
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,440
In that gap?

528
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,360
Yep, yep, not impossible.

529
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,400
But yeah.

530
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,680
We will see.

531
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,520
I will note that Montreal twenty twenty seven, uh, you should get yourself a better website.

532
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Are we gonna say that every week now?

533
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,920
Yeah, pretty much.

534
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,280
Just a sketch website?

535
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,640
Do we need a picture of a moose having a shower?

536
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,020
Um, yep, yep, yeah, for our Montreal updates.

537
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,460
It's tricky, right?

538
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,860
Because I I don't want to be mean, but what I am gonna say

539
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:27,179
Is that I could make a better website like than this in an hour?

540
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:32,059
I would say that um Montreal's performing pretty much as expected.

541
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:40,280
The um website is uh for listeners who haven't visited currently pixelated JPEG screenshots of documents

542
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:46,040
Including hilariously one document where the word worldcon was highlighted when they took the screenshot.

543
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,200
So there's just a weird blue box around the words.

544
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,879
But am I am I on the wrong side?

545
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh I'm on the bid site.

546
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,480
Okay.

547
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,160
Yeah, no, the site oh yeah no, Liz, go on the go on the site site, it's so much worse.

548
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,680
Sorry, I I Googled for oh, so the

549
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,779
Oh no, okay.

550
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:03,339
They've messed up the link from the bid site to the real website.

551
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:03,740
Okay.

552
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:13,660
Also, I don't like some of the information is in English and French, but there's quite a lot of it that's only in English, which for a WorldCon in a uh

553
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,859
bilingual territory is not great.

554
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,619
Um yeah, just mm.

555
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:25,099
Oh I see they're like oh no but these are the same things that were on the are the same yeah the same things that were on the bid site but at lower resolution

556
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,920
Just what is happening?

557
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,040
Come on, come on.

558
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,720
Get your website sorted out.

559
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
And if there is internal politics that means you can't have a good website.

560
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,280
That does not bode well for running a world con.

561
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,599
Oh my god!

562
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Oh I've just seen this I've just seen the convention's website.

563
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,200
Oh I mean I think I had also been looking at the big bid website and the holding page.

564
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,200
Oh this is shocking

565
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,660
You can buy a membership though.

566
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,539
That's good.

567
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:57,099
So they're ahead of Chengdu uh at the stage at this stage of things, so that's nice.

568
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,760
It's a low potentially low bar.

569
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,680
I I think they're behind all of the bids that have submitted questionnaires for the

570
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:08,539
For the SmofCon QA, right?

571
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:14,059
I mean they've submitted a thing for the SmovCon QA, which has, you know, information in it.

572
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,200
So they do have quite a lot of information there.

573
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,240
It's just that you would expect by this point that information to be on a website and it's it's not on a website yet.

574
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,640
It's in a PDF on the SmovCon website

575
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:35,200
But yeah, if you if you think about timelines and stuff, right, and I always think about timelines in terms of um program, because program is a thing where it has a surprisingly long timeline, then you know

576
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,119
at this time out, where where should you be in your cycle?

577
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,880
And you should be thinking about, okay, well when do we open our programme Participant Questionnaire?

578
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,599
I mean you got a few months left, but it's like if you haven't actually got a website for people to start

579
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:59,280
registering their interest in that or for like suggesting stuff for you, then you want to get that going pretty quickly because you've got essentially now, what, eight months before LA Con and at LA Con you need to be

580
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,260
absolutely full of stuff.

581
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:09,340
So what they have told SmofCon is that they have s they have staffed up and they've listed all of the DHs, which I had not previously seen.

582
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,220
That's good.

583
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,180
I was very excited to see the list of um

584
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,940
of division heads for Montreal because it's really good to get some names in the frame.

585
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:23,700
Um and if you want to see that list in full, you can go and have a look at it at the Swathgol website, which we would recommend that you do so.

586
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,580
For some reason you cannot see it on the Montreal website.

587
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,620
But guys

588
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,700
Get a website.

589
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,900
Agreed.

590
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,600
Shall we discuss Novicon a little bit?

591
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,080
Yeah, I thought I just wanted to hear a bit more about how you guys did at Novicon.

592
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,960
I had a nice time listening to podcasts that I wasn't on, slightly sulkily because it's like

593
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:53,779
You guys did not actually need me, you have got a perfectly good replacement should you ever require it.

594
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:55,460
Wasn't Emily good?

595
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,020
Yeah.

596
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,220
Well it's not surprising.

597
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:58,500
I mean she is like

598
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,860
A Hugo Award winning writer and podcaster, so I am one of those things.

599
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,740
She is like the double threat.

600
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,380
Now you know how I feel about Laurie.

601
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,420
A

602
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,940
But I think, you know, we would never we would never replace either of you.

603
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,340
Oh, isn't that the use of the word we?

604
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,220
Well, you know what I mean.

605
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:25,099
I mean I also know that if Emily was doing the regular recording sessions, she probably would uh have to rage quit pretty quickly.

606
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,120
Hello, I missed you both.

607
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:36,760
Before you talk about Novicon, um a brief plug for what I did while I was not on the podcast, which is I met listener Ming.

608
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,500
Yay!

609
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:45,339
Who came to visit my city and I took him out for way too much food and he gave me a bunch of nice New Zealand chocolate.

610
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,300
Thank you, Ming.

611
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:54,260
Um and we had a nice time wandering around the park and he looked for diet monitor lizards and then we ate a load of food and went to a mall and it was a very, you know, Bangkok experience.

612
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,180
And also hello to listener Tammy who um showed me around Toronto.

613
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,060
Thank you, Tammy.

614
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,180
Yes, I saw the pictures.

615
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,260
I was like, what was Liz doing in Toronto?

616
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,140
Work.

617
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,180
And then

618
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,560
Eating.

619
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,120
Yeah.

620
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,760
I I only saw the photos of the eating bit.

621
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,960
Yeah, well the photos of the work were like any you're you're in a windowless conference center for five days.

622
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,680
I didn't take a lot of photos.

623
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,560
And then I went out and did things that involved sunshine.

624
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,360
Daylight.

625
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:29,000
I realise we also have to do a shout out to Listener Tobes, who gave us presents at Novicon.

626
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,080
Does Liz know about this yet?

627
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,480
There was some vague reference on the pod to Tobes giving you a present, but I can't remember what it was.

628
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,200
Yeah.

629
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:36,840
Ooh.

630
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,640
They're Octhorps

631
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:41,619
They're wooden octothorps.

632
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:50,020
To those since we are not actually a video podcast yet, uh John has uh displayed a wooden octothorpe at the camera for me.

633
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,220
And it looks f

634
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,580
Very neat.

635
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,860
It is very neat.

636
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,860
Has Tobe's taken up woodworking?

637
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,820
No, I don't think so, although obviously um

638
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,500
I think Toads would be excellent at working with Wood.

639
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:07,100
But I think he works for a company that makes among other things, perhaps.

640
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,020
Physical representations of letters and characters.

641
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:11,700
I thought it was one of his mates.

642
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:13,220
I think it's one of his mates.

643
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,099
I thought it was one of Tobes' mates who does these things.

644
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,700
Tobes, write in.

645
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:18,660
It's very nice.

646
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,660
But anyway, so we have wooden knots or did you s give us three or four, John?

647
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,460
Four.

648
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,660
One each, and then one for our stunt Liz.

649
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,720
Oh well thank you Tobes.

650
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
I look forward to getting my Octotop.

651
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,160
Oh excuse me.

652
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,920
And putting it on my display next to my Hugo.

653
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,560
And the little um fake you go that uh Laurie gave me.

654
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,280
Do you still have your snow globe?

655
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,840
Eee yes, but I don't know where I put the snow globe.

656
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,520
It might be in the drawer of miscellaneous things.

657
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,160
I think it actually is in the drawer of miscellaneous things.

658
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,120
Mine is next to um uh my James Shield's dice and a vial of my own blood.

659
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,280
I'm starting a little a little uh

660
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,839
Yeah, collection of Octathorpe things, although I don't have a vial of my own blood.

661
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,440
Um Oh l sa Octathorpe relics are a thing now?

662
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,839
Yes, Octathorpe relics are a thing.

663
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,319
You

664
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,640
Holy John relics?

665
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:16,839
We can sell tiny portions of the true John.

666
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,319
We are not selling any tiny portions of the true John, but we are selling

667
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:28,119
shirts, mugs, hoodies, and tote bags, and there will be a link in the show notes.

668
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,559
Can you sell your own blood online UK?

669
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,480
Yeah, we are not selling relics.

670
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,280
Yet.

671
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,280
Oh, that would be funny though.

672
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,920
Could you all please send me your toenail clippings?

673
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,560
No.

674
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,760
Was that alright for a very quick sponsor read, John?

675
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,080
I mean

676
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,160
Yes.

677
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
Because it you know what time of year it is.

678
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,440
Is there anything else we want to say about Novicon?

679
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,280
Novicon was fine, it was Novicon

680
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:59,240
It doesn't it's in the same place as it was last time I went to Novicon.

681
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,119
They moved the rooms around to to try and trick me.

682
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,160
There's now a fridge of secret beers, which are better than the beers that are on tap, so that's nice.

683
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,400
I think there was last year as well.

684
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,960
My room was up several flights of stairs and was fine.

685
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,720
Buxton's quite nice.

686
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,160
Had one of the best Scotch eggs I've ever had in my life.

687
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:18,900
Where was that?

688
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,820
The Buxton tap, is it?

689
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:28,020
I had half a chicken, and then me and Tommy Ferguson uh shared a black pudding scotch egg, which was absolutely phenomenal.

690
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,740
Buxton has a vibrant food culture.

691
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,420
Mmm, yes it does.

692
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:41,299
And they didn't have a banquet this year, but that was fine because my only experience with the NovaCon banquet was quite disappointing and

693
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:46,599
I also think that if your hotel is in the middle of nowhere, having a banquet on the Sunday night can be quite nice.

694
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,240
But if your hotel is in the middle of quite a nice town with loads of nice restaurants, the value proposition is a bit different.

695
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,300
And I talked with Dave Hodson a lot, and that was fun, and we talked about games in quite a lot of detail.

696
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,300
Yeah, no, I had a lovely time at Novicon.

697
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,260
I went to an enormous amount of the programme which is not

698
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,060
How NovaCon is supposed to work 'cause you're supposed to kind of ignore the programme and go wandering around Buxton.

699
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,420
Who are you and what what did you do with Alison?

700
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,580
So I blame Esther McCallum Stewart.

701
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,300
Um

702
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:26,500
And also probably Emily Tesh, because I think one of the reasons that the programme was so good was that Emily was the guest and they put her on a lot of interesting things because she is a very interesting person.

703
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,880
But all of the program I went to was jolly good and I and and more please, this was good, this is what programme should be like.

704
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,000
I also spent a little bit of time talking to the people from FunCon 2, which has launched.

705
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,680
I don't know if we've mentioned FunCon 2, but it's not till twenty seventy-seven, so we've got plenty of time to do that, but that's back at that hotel.

706
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,480
And instead of Space Leopards, which were kinda cute.

707
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,260
they now have a thousand angry wasps who don't sound cute at all to me.

708
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:57,460
I mean I think we should say thank you to Esther again for letting you guys hijack the Novicon guest of honor to be on your podcast.

709
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,900
Thank you, Esther

710
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,560
Well thank you Emily and thank you Esther for putting on a fantastic programme and to all the Novicon committee.

711
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,720
I think that was the best Novicon for some time.

712
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,920
Um I like Novicon generally, but I had a really good time, didn't get as much drinking done.

713
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,860
Um maybe next year.

714
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:20,820
Another thing we didn't talk about in our Novicon episode was Novicon 55, which will be in 2026, and they announced the Guest of Honor, who will be

715
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:31,500
Una McCormack, who is a science fiction writer who has written a lot, including in franchises like Doctor Who and Star Trek and For Big Finish.

716
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:39,960
um but has also done a bunch of stuff in academia and has just been doing a lot of work in British science fiction fandom in general.

717
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:44,500
So she gave the Guest of Honour speech to the Tolkien Society in 2019, for instance.

718
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,180
So yeah, like I think that is a that is a good and interesting guest of honour.

719
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,340
So um congratulations to Una.

720
00:44:50,559 --> 00:45:01,440
And when they announced this they said they thought that we had as a as a community been quite remiss in honoring people whose primary work was in

721
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,880
tie-in novels and um novels in shared spaces and I think that's probably fair.

722
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,920
And I'm very interested in seeing what she has to say and maybe reading some of her stuff before Novicon.

723
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,240
So please write in with recommendations

724
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:22,260
But the thing is interesting is that she was one of the people who was um co-director of Anglia Ruskin's Center for Science Fiction and Fantasy.

725
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:22,740
So her

726
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:30,900
impact on academic work on the genre in the UK is also very large and I think we're also quite bad at recognizing

727
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,240
people who contribute to the critical side of things in Britain.

728
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,280
And it is interesting to have a guest of honour who might be able to speak more on that.

729
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,700
Shall we yeah, shall we do pics?

730
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,380
Shall I go first?

731
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,920
Um, if you would like to.

732
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,680
Yes, but no spoilers.

733
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,480
Okay.

734
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,520
Sorry, I've seen I've seen your pick, so no spoilers.

735
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,119
I haven't wa I haven't watched it yet.

736
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,760
What counts as a spoiler?

737
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,440
Big things on the back of cars.

738
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,480
Come on, Sean.

739
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,839
Just go for it and if I think you're spoiling it, I'll take my headphones off and sing Lala Laugh for ten seconds.

740
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:16,420
So my pick for this week is Pluribus, which is a new science fiction television show on Apple TV.

741
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,500
Sorry guys, just you know.

742
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:24,900
I mean wait for a month and then buy it for a month because they're releasing the episodes one at a time in quite an annoying fashion.

743
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,660
Um, which means I've only seen the first f

744
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,300
Five episodes of this show because that's how many there are at the moment.

745
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:37,180
This is a new science fiction show by Vince Gilligan, who is famous for Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.

746
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,700
And m

747
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:46,600
I am watching it because first of all my daughter said it will be the next big thing and everyone will be talking about it and all the young people are talking about it.

748
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,240
And then

749
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,420
Lillian said I heard that would be the next big thing and then I read an article that says this is the next big thing.

750
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,380
Why is nobody watching it?

751
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,220
Answer because it's on Apple TV.

752
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,020
Um

753
00:46:56,359 --> 00:47:03,960
I I think probably it is the next big thing, but it's also because it's a science fiction TV show, quite like quite a lot of previous big things.

754
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:04,520
Um

755
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:15,380
The first episode is a bit kind of weird and violent and isn't quite like the rest of the show has been, so you might want to give it two episodes to see if you like it.

756
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:15,940
Um

757
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:24,440
we have an event that causes everyone, almost everybody on the planet to become um

758
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,740
connected mentally.

759
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,740
Um I think that's probably enough of it really.

760
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:37,460
And our protagonist is somebody who this does not apply to and you are viewing her reactions to this and what

761
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,900
is going on.

762
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,740
That makes it kind of weird show.

763
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:52,020
It is beautifully and expensively shot, and it is all very lovely to look at, and some of the scenes where people are acting in a coordinated fashion are extremely

764
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,580
good and interesting to watch and you go, Oh, I hadn't thought about that.

765
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,940
Ooh, that's interesting.

766
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:05,940
But quite a lot of time if you're a science fiction fan you will have thought about this and a lot of what's going on is not very new.

767
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,660
So

768
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:13,859
and so therefore it's quite a slow burn and because we don't actually have all that many characters in this show.

769
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:19,380
So you have to kind of like the main character who is Rhea Seaborn playing Carol Sturker.

770
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:34,100
who is very amusingly a writer of um romanticy novels um and and there is a fantastic scene in the first episode where she is meeting her adoring fans that I feel something must come of that later.

771
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:45,720
Um it's not obvious why the fact that she is a writer of romanticy should make her act in the way she does in subsequent episodes, but it's all very interesting and um

772
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,240
And we're enjoying it a lot.

773
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,840
I'll definitely watch it all.

774
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:57,720
But it's got some caveats because it is quite slow moving and there are lots of scenes where it is just essentially

775
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,840
Carol interacting with maybe one other person.

776
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,880
So there's not a lot of characters in this show.

777
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,640
Um but no, it's exciting.

778
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:12,160
It's nice to see high budget, illiterate, interesting science fiction on television, and I approve.

779
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:12,700
Sounds good.

780
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:20,859
I mean I would say that there is a reasonable amount of high budget literate science fiction television and it's all on Apple TV.

781
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:21,500
Yep.

782
00:49:21,819 --> 00:49:25,579
Yes, is this yet another serious science fiction I've told because I

783
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:35,840
crashed out of foundation after f three or four episodes and people say, Oh no, that's really good and you should stick with it and I haven't seen Silo yet which lots of people like, so yeah, no.

784
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,200
And obviously severance, so yeah, Apple TV seems to be a good place for science fiction at the moment.

785
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,960
And for all mankind and the for all mankind spin-off that we're getting.

786
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:53,740
Who at Apple love science fiction so much that they are willing to spend millions and millions of pounds on glossy, elaborate, uh literate science fiction shows.

787
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,320
And how long how long will they keep doing it?

788
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,400
That last one is a great question, but we should enjoy it while it's here.

789
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,600
We should.

790
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:08,240
And also Apple's ability to put very large sums of money after something is almost unequalled.

791
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,880
So probably until somebody notices, I would think.

792
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,079
I remember listeners, when I was a lad

793
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:19,060
that there was enough science fiction that you watched it all because that was just that was it.

794
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:23,780
There was well I remember when it was just Battlest Galactica and um Chuck.

795
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:33,040
Oh, but that's like the glory days compared to like all you had was uh six different Star Trek and then some stuff that was all made in a forest in British Columbia.

796
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,680
No, I mean that's the thing, right?

797
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:42,040
Like we are in this golden age and every so there's too much stuff and it needs to, you know, there are too many streaming services, they need to get rid of some and I'm like, you don't remember.

798
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,640
You don't remember the old days.

799
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,920
I don't want to go back.

800
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,840
You can't make me go back.

801
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:51,420
Alright, so I am picking uh The Summer War by Naomi Novic.

802
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,820
I believe it is a novella, but it's maybe a long novella, short novel, so that's gonna be fun.

803
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,020
Come Hugo time.

804
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,599
I sort of struggled to say think what to say about it.

805
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:08,320
Basically it is a good Naomi Novic book and she has made written lots of good books and if you like them you will probably like the Summer War and if you don't like what Naomi Novic

806
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:16,440
does you probably won't like it but yes it is essentially um a fantasy world and they and they live on the edge of the summerlands where the

807
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:27,320
fairies live and there was kind of a war between those two nations which has been settled by our protagonist's father and it is about Celia

808
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:37,000
Uh basically her older brother leaves home to go and wander the summerlands and upends her life and she kind of inadvertently curses him and it's about what she wants

809
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:42,740
how she tries to put things right and how she tries to find a solution uh to this.

810
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,779
So it's sort of a fantasy tale with

811
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:52,779
fairly typical sort of Fay who are beautiful and harsh and cruel in equal measure.

812
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,339
But I just think it's like a nicely done one.

813
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,220
I enjoyed Celia, although I will say that I think

814
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:05,960
I was reading her as much older than she actually is at the start of the book, um because for various reasons at the start of the book she's sort of about twelve or thirteen.

815
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:13,840
And she feels a little bit older, but then when she ages up kind of in the latest age of the book to sixteen, then it feels a lot more realistic about kind of that mindset of a young

816
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:24,900
person, but I really enjoyed her and so she's got two brothers and her older brother leaves and she's furious that he has abandoned her and then that really affects her relationship with the middle brother

817
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:34,160
and I really liked kind of how they come to work together and how it affects their family dynamic and then how the family dynamic is

818
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:40,180
As you would expect, and it's not spoiler, key to figuring out what is going on and leading to a satisfying resolution.

819
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,660
I would say I think it's a little bit like

820
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,680
Their ending is a little bit too pat.

821
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,680
Things fall into place a little bit too easily, which might be part partly because it's not a particularly long book.

822
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,720
But I just sat down and read it in the morning and I enjoyed it

823
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,039
Way.

824
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,119
Is it gonna be submitted for the Clark?

825
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,920
Is it science fiction arguably or just definitely fantasy?

826
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,200
No, it's definitely fantasy.

827
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,640
Doesn't always stop people from um from submitting them to the Clark, but uh No, that sounds interesting.

828
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,720
I have liked everything else I've read by

829
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,140
Naomi Novic, so I might well look that up.

830
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:21,740
Given it is a novella, I wouldn't be a hundred per cent surprised to see it on the Hugo list if it manages to make a break against the the Tor domination.

831
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,500
Thinks we'd have a good chance.

832
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,380
So then you might get it next year.

833
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,340
Interesting.

834
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:33,540
So obviously you have both picked recent things, and I'm gonna pick a less recent thing.

835
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,580
I'm gonna pick uh the Truman Show.

836
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,060
Ooh.

837
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,820
From nineteen ninety eight.

838
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,740
Had you not previously seen it, John?

839
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,500
I had not previously seen it.

840
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,900
Oh man, I should have picked that as a film for us to watch.

841
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,020
I really like the Truman Show.

842
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,220
Yeah, yeah, that would be great.

843
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,900
I just assumed John had seen it.

844
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:49,940
It's really good.

845
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:50,740
Yes.

846
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:51,920
Yeah.

847
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,520
I gave it a five stars and I'll and and and and Hispania was like, she was like, you've given it five stars.

848
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,080
And I was like, name one thing that could be better about it.

849
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,360
It's very well paced.

850
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,520
Jim Carrey, like, if you don't like Jim Carrey, there's an obvious thing that could be better about it.

851
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,160
Um but I will say he is

852
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,620
Oh, he's very restrained in this.

853
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,100
Well, he's phenomenal in the role I thought.

854
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:20,460
I thought it was really, really well acted, and I don't know if I can think of another actor that I think would be able to do it the same way.

855
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,599
But also just like Ed Harris is amazing, as is, I mean the entire cast is great.

856
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,400
It's an excellent conceit done in exactly the length of time it needs and not longer.

857
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:41,260
Uh it's 103 minutes, it's perfectly lengthed, very well paced, and also I thought extremely prescient because

858
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:54,800
Not so much there's obvious prescience around the rise of reality TV, but I saw it very much as like if you think of Ed Harris as the Zuckerberg type and Truman as a representative of people being swayed by

859
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:03,059
social media, you've got the reclusive billionaire who very much respects his own privacy and doesn't really see anyone else's privacy as something worth a damn.

860
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:13,800
And you just can see it as like a warning of, you know, m 2025 social media landscape in a really, really terrifying, impression way, which I

861
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,480
um I liked a a great deal.

862
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:25,200
So I think in in s several ways it's much more much more science fiction in the terms of like prediction than many of the science fiction films I've watched.

863
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,080
And I am actually shocked, so

864
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:40,520
Lispania and I, um for those who don't know, um Hispanior and I have been working through the timeout list of the top one hundred science fiction films, and this does not appear on that list, and having watched it, I think that might be an outrage.

865
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:42,599
Um, because I think it might be

866
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,900
one of the best science fiction films out there.

867
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,540
So if you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend you watch it.

868
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,380
Unless you really hate Jim Carrey, in which case it is a harder sell, I admit.

869
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,980
No, but you should watch it.

870
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:53,900
You should watch it anyway.

871
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:54,619
Yeah.

872
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,700
I I genuinely think it's great.

873
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:05,180
Because of the film to change your mind about him, then it would be this one, and it's more effective, I think, because you think of him as the the clownish figure.

874
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,560
I mean this is a serious science fiction film in which he plays a character extremely well.

875
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,840
It's a great performance.

876
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,200
In fact it made me more irritated about Jim Carrey generally because now I know he can act.

877
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:25,640
Well the other cause like um Eternal Spot Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is another one where he is extremely good um and it's a very, very good science fiction movie.

878
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,600
Have you both seen that?

879
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,720
I assume you have.

880
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,140
Yes.

881
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:28,700
Yes.

882
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:33,020
I can't believe we have wasted this discussion on a pick when we could've done a whole episode, John.

883
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,100
I mean, it's not too late, Liz.

884
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,260
We could we could do a whole episode on it.

885
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,000
Uh I'll endeavour to forget it.

886
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,680
If I just hit my head enough times.

887
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:50,200
What I'm gonna do though is I'm now I'm gonna like go through my potential film picks or whatever it was gonna make us do, and also go, Ooh, I can't assume that they've all seen this one.

888
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,800
Maybe I should check.

889
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,040
We're gonna do the Jugger movie, right?

890
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,920
I think the Jugger movie should be like a bonus episode.

891
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,040
What for like a bonus bonus episode?

892
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah.

893
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,600
Like a you can really skip this one if you would like episode.

894
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:15,320
But no, I mean I have a massive soft spot for movies that have an idea and implement it well.

895
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:20,760
and don't overstay their welcome and the Truman Show is definitely an example of of that.

896
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,400
It feels like a well-executed short story.

897
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:29,880
And I think that's where science fiction cinema is it as is at its best, is when it feels like a short story.

898
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,960
Yeah, nowadays as a strong risk they would have turned it into like uh

899
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:42,359
A multiple season mini sh mini series show and you'd like spend the whole first series waiting for tr the like light to drop on Truman.

900
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:52,260
Yeah, you can imagine the version of this film where it's a bit like the good place and the end of season one is the reveal that he is you know, he has finally realized and it's a four-season thing.

901
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:54,700
Yeah, it'd be like surf the surf Dracula thing, right?

902
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:54,940
Yeah.

903
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,299
I'm not saying I couldn't.

904
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,660
Like I'm not saying uh but yeah, I I dunno, I quite like it.

905
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,819
Hundred and hundred odd minutes.

906
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:02,779
Perfect.

907
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,940
I I also

908
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:12,760
It's fascinating that you're making this argument for movies when we have the exact reverse argument for books all of the time.

909
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,839
Where I'm like, a book should say what it needs to say and then get out of the way and you're like series, they're the best.

910
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,400
But series are made of discrete books.

911
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,680
And apparently the wicked series is made of discrete films.

912
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,000
It's made of discrete movies in the same way that Lord of the Rings is made of discrete books.

913
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,800
If you carve it up later, it's not quite as good.

914
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,780
Lots of series are like that though.

915
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:38,980
I have definitely complained about many, many books being too long.

916
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:39,780
Yeah, but

917
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,440
It's not shown.

918
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,600
Well, I think John has complained about books being too long.

919
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,880
But I think I do take John's point that like a good serialized thing is different.

920
00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:59,380
A set of good serialized novels is different from one long novel which has been chopped up, or even novels which have been dragged out too long individually as parts of a series, even if they might make a satisfying series.

921
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:49,640
It

922
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,160
We may have gone slightly astray from The Truman Show.

923
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,400
And that was the Octothorpe podcast.

924
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,680
And it's goodbye for me.

925
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,120
It's goodbye from me.

926
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,880
And it's goodbye from me.

927
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,140
I'm trying to look up the etymology of the word mathmo

928
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,580
uh because I'm uh good at paying attention to our award-winning podcast.

929
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:41,660
Uh and there's a page from 2003 that mentions mathmoes.

930
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,960
Uh and that page is mathmo.

931
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,080
org.

932
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,840
Um I mean they're absolutely mathmos at the turn of the century.

933
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,200
So they absolutely it they weren't in the eighties, so

934
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:53,340
Sometime between then.

935
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:59,980
So if we've got anyone who was at Cambridge between 1980 and 2000, please let us know whether you remember the word mathmo.

936
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,720
Mm, nineteen eighty-six I left, yeah.

937
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,840
'Cause as we d as we discussed last week, we probably have quite a few listeners who were there between in the early eighties.

938
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:08,560
Yes.

939
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,880
And if you know of any Math Mos who are also famous Belgians, obviously.

940
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,880
Uh oh, like Simon Stevin.

941
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:27,600
