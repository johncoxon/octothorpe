1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,520
Hello everyone, it's John here.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,600
Just before we get started, this is live audio recorded from Novacon 54.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,639
You might notice the odd audio glitch here and there.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,680
H

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,280
There's not much we can do about that, but I think the audio is entirely listenable.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,640
So hopefully everyone else enjoys it too.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,600
Secondly, this episode we have a sponsor read.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,920
Octothorpe is brought to you by Stow Shirts, which is just Alison with an Octothorpe logo hat on.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,940
We don't yet have hats, but we have lots of other merchandise for you, both for Octothorpe and for Iridescence, the 2026 Eastercon.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,900
You can see it all by going to www.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,260
stowshirts.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:40,900
com.

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,220
You can see all of the Octothorpe and Iridescence merch by going there.

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:52,500
For the first time, this includes Octothorpe mugs, hoodies and totes as well as T-shirts, all in very slightly different shades of purple.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,460
The iridescence merchandise is especially lovely because it features artwork by España Sheriff.

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,460
These make perfect presents for everyone you know and even your office Secret Santa.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, maybe not that last one.

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,480
All our merchandise is printed for us by a UK company and they ship worldwide.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,520
Bye now.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,960
Don't delay.

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,240
And with that, it's on with the podcast.

22
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:14,280
You've got notes.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,799
You've written them on paper.

24
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:16,600
Yeah, I know.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,280
I know it's not on the round, is it?

26
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:19,799
I haven't got any notes.

27
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:21,720
I am extemporizing all of this.

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,520
Yes!

29
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,980
Hello everyone and welcome to Octothorpe Live!

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm John Coxon.

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,180
I'm Alison Scott

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
And I'm not Liz Batty.

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,120
I am in fact Emily Tesh.

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,080
Whee.

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Yes, welcome Emily to the Octothorpe Podcast.

36
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,979
Thank you for having me.

37
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,180
I'm very excited to be here.

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,299
Do you want to do a little introduction to yourselves to yourself to or to any of yourselves for our listeners and audience?

39
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,020
Uh all right, let me see if I can do this.

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,259
I have two versions of self-introduction.

41
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,020
There's one I do when I'm on phone calls with Americans, and there's my normal one.

42
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,220
And the normal one goes, I'm Emily and I write books sometimes

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,940
And the American one goes, I am multiple award-winning author Emily Tesh.

44
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,220
You have heard of me.

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,700
Most recently uh I won a Hugo this year for Best Fan Cast, which is

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,040
Very funny.

47
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm very jet grateful to the generous voters who put up with all the sound issues.

48
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,680
And I won a Hugo last year for Best Novel.

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,439
Uh for my debut novel Some Desperate Glory.

50
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,280
I am also the author of The Green Hollow Duology, of which the first book won the World Fantasy Award for Best Novella.

51
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:55,220
Uh and most recently for The Incandescent, which came out uh this spring and which has not won any awards, but I think it's quite good.

52
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:56,019
Hey.

53
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,220
Well it hasn't it hasn't really had time to win awards yet, to be fair.

54
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,260
Yeah, maybe yet.

55
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,819
Yes.

56
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:02,659
We think it's quite good too.

57
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,060
Yes.

58
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:03,860
Spoiler.

59
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,700
Um we do, we do indeed.

60
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,500
Um so

61
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,500
Just by show of just by cheering, if you haven't heard an episode of Octothorpe before, please cheer now.

62
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,340
Listen to how happy they sound.

63
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,140
We will decrease your happiness over the next hour.

64
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,500
It's a guarantee.

65
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,319
Um Emily will not.

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,680
Emily will increase it, but we will work tirelessly to counteract that.

67
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,840
Um and then if you are a current listener, please uh cheer now.

68
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
See, that's what it sounds like to have no hope left.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
Um no welcome everyone.

70
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,000
Welcome, welcome.

71
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,320
And we're in the big room this year

72
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,140
Yeah.

73
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,980
Which is very exciting for us.

74
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:48,299
We've we've done Octothorpe Live at Novacons and Eastercons and WorldCons, a well-won WorldCon, and we've never been in the big room before.

75
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,980
So we are very excited by that.

76
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,500
Well I am anyway.

77
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:51,680
Yes.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,599
I think it might not be us.

79
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,280
There might be other other draws.

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,319
Um so yes, Emily, hello.

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:00,959
Hi.

82
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,680
How have you enjoyed NovaCon?

83
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,020
I'm having the best time in the world.

84
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:16,180
Uh it has been absolutely wonderful being here in this sort of magnificent decaying Agatha Christie hotel where you keep expecting to find a body.

85
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:20,019
I have been coming here for some years, I have never found a body.

86
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,180
Maybe you weren't looking hard enough.

87
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,139
You do get distracted.

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,260
absolutely wonderful here and I've had the loveliest time and people keep buying me drinks.

89
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,900
Uh honestly the guest of honorarch is wonderful.

90
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,340
I really recommend it.

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,920
Is is this the first time you've been guest of honour at a convention?

92
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,880
Yes it is.

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,200
And I was I was shocked to be asked.

94
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,960
Uh I mean I'm s

95
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,300
I have a dis I don't quite believe in myself as a as the person who won all those awards.

96
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,900
It doesn't sound really very plausible.

97
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,580
So I'm like I I'm I'm just M and I write books sometimes.

98
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,640
Me?

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,440
Really did you did you want someone else?

100
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,720
No.

101
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,160
Well there must be I I it it's it was a shock and an honor uh genuinely to be invited.

102
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
And then I didn't quite realise what it would involve.

103
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,360
I was like, yeah, I'll do that.

104
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,320
That sounds fun.

105
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Uh uh you want me to be on how many program I So there's a whole thing where you're not supposed to overwork

106
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,460
your guests and I'm I'm not being overworked.

107
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,780
It's just I keep being bought drinks in between.

108
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,139
Yes, yes.

109
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,940
No the the And on panel items.

110
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:32,020
Yes.

111
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:41,860
The the the great thing about Novacon I think is that because it's a convention that puts its guests on interesting programming, it's a convention where if you like the guests you want to go to Novacon.

112
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,620
Like I don't go to every Novacon.

113
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:53,260
I tend to only go to the NovaCons where the guest is a draw for me, um, which is I guess uh a fanboy moment, which we should skate right past because I'm cool and experienced.

114
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,100
Um

115
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,759
But no, I go to Novacon every year regardless of who the guest is.

116
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,919
Um I I I would uh I I would only miss it if I was dead, I think.

117
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,800
Or obviously had a communicable disease.

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,840
Yes.

119
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,560
Having read your communicable disease policy.

120
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,640
Um I mean sorry, having the sort of communicable disease that you can spread in the bar.

121
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,199
For those keeping count, it has been four minutes.

122
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:36,160
Um so um but no I think Novacon I think Novacon is a place where people come if they like the guest and I think Novacon is also very good at identifying people.

123
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,400
who should be guests of honor early uh and getting them and and I think that's one of the things the convention does very well.

124
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,880
So I think you're a perfect Novacon guest of honor.

125
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,879
Um there was an enormous cheer in the room at the when you were announced as the guest of honor at last year's neighbor call.

126
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,340
Jen it's lucky the podcast like doesn't record my face.

127
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,540
But would people in the audience see it?

128
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,259
Would people in the audience mind recording Emily's face?

129
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:02,500
face.

130
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:12,820
Well no the question is would Emily remind you that you have the uh okay oh yeah no no you're allowed to say I don't want to be photographed but if you do that

131
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,260
That's a kind of weird thing for a guest of order to do.

132
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,620
Please don't photograph.

133
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,620
Could somebody please take a nice photo of the three of us in order at some point?

134
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,140
Because that's how we're gonna do the cover for this.

135
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:22,780
Yes.

136
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,699
But yes, no, this is a a face of like like uh shock and embarrassment every time.

137
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:38,060
I am genuinely so surprised and so grateful to Fandom for being so welcoming and so kind.

138
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:38,940
Uh like

139
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,920
I was talking to Alison beforehand.

140
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,040
I always considered myself a fan.

141
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,600
Like back to my teenage years, I grew up in fandom, but I'm a millennial.

142
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,280
My fandom was on the internet.

143
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,440
I didn't know there were real people.

144
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,620
No that is fair.

145
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,260
Hands up everyone who got into fandom before they got the internet.

146
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,380
Yeah.

147
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,100
No.

148
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,380
Island books, but Emily and I were born in the same year, so I suspect our I was on Live Journal before I went to a pub meeting.

149
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,100
Uh and that's funny, because you went to pub meetings when you were about thirteen.

150
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,620
Yeah, I mean, you know.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,840
I I I say I tell people I've known John since he was a toddler, but that's not true.

152
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,000
I have only known him since he was an early teen.

153
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,240
I have now been attending Eastercons for longer than I haven't.

154
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:40,580
As in as in like I started at when I my age when I started attending Eastercons is younger than my uh time spent attending Eastercons.

155
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,600
I have now been attending Eastercons for more than twice as long as I haven't.

156
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,920
But let's go back to Emily's experience on account of how

157
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:56,540
People have spent 147 episodes listening to us twitter on, but Emily is new and interesting.

158
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,500
So, how have you found being a guest of honour?

159
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
Really, really, really lovely.

160
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,080
Did I mention people keep buying me drinks?

161
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,200
Um No, I've had a wonderful time.

162
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,920
Um I was on the first night I was on a desert island books item

163
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,660
Which was great 'cause they were like, you can invite someone to be with you and though, I'll bring my bestie.

164
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,420
Um so I brought my best friend Everena Maxwell

165
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,320
with me to Novacon to interview me about my favourite books, many of which are also books she likes a lot.

166
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,160
And it's like I get to talk uh Volkosigans with Ev

167
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:34,899
in front of an audience who can't get away and had a simply wonderful time.

168
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:38,019
Um and then what else have I been doing?

169
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,220
Uh I have been in an act of

170
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,360
Courage?

171
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,240
Madness?

172
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,800
I was like, I have small children.

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,720
I will bring the children to the con.

174
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,240
What could go wrong?

175
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,200
Uh the children are having a wonderful time too.

176
00:09:52,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Uh and so I've been kind of going from events and panels back to my kids telling me there are three flights of stairs

177
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,020
Do you want to go up all of them with us?

178
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,060
And down and up and down and up.

179
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,420
Oh did they also forget an audio cable in their room?

180
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,420
Um So is this their first convention then?

181
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,400
It is their first convention.

182
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,560
Um, probably not their last.

183
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:28,640
Uh I was basically I either either I figure out a way to make cons with children work or I just don't go to cons for the next ten years.

184
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,880
And the second option seemed really sad.

185
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:41,520
And everyone's actually just not just kind and lovely and welcoming to me, the person you paid money to see, but also has been very kind and lovely and welcoming to my one-year-old and my five-year-old.

186
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,720
So thank you.

187
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:55,480
So so so John does not have children, but I I took I took my children to a very large number of conventions when they were small, as many people will remember I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I don't know if you

188
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,399
But they and and I'm and they were they were maybe not the most delightful children, but they are now delightful adults, so you know.

189
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,399
But but it's possible, it's perfectly possible, lots of

190
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,660
People will help.

191
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:16,779
There there's sometimes we have childcare at Eastercons, but we're all greying and there's not as much call for it as there used to be.

192
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:19,100
But you should write to the Eastercon and say

193
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,680
You must have childcare because it's in incredibly important to my enjoyment of the Easter con and sorry, sorry, Phil.

194
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,120
Is Phil in the audience?

195
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
Yeah, and I th I think I did tick

196
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,680
the box saying I I am interested in a crash.

197
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,520
I would love it if there was a crash.

198
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:44,360
And I I think if you're trying to take part in fandom you want to get involved and do fun things, but if you also have caring responsibilities, it it's always gonna be a balance of

199
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,240
Well I can't just abandon my kids in the hotel foyer.

200
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:59,240
Oh no No, I mean I mean I mean what responsible Fannish parent would take that attitude to their children, Alison Okay look I only Because Emily

201
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,600
I didn't know how good a segue that was into different stuff of pieces.

202
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,319
Such a good straight line because honestly I

203
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,740
only got drunk and left my baby in the bar once.

204
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,220
At this point Noel said, you asked me to look after Jonathan when they were a baby

205
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:20,680
And did you?

206
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,320
Yeah.

207
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,600
Well you see?

208
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:22,920
Yeah.

209
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,279
How many people have I asked to look after my children at one point or another?

210
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,320
There is there is I would say five hands in the audience.

211
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,920
Steve but you definitely need to

212
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,020
Oh, did she have a good time?

213
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,140
But you took Alison says that she took

214
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,600
Mariana Marianne to the zoo in Jersey.

215
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:47,920
Yes.

216
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,080
I need to say these things because otherwise they won't appear on the side.

217
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:08,760
meeting room and then ha setting up a rotor and putting the toys in and babysitting each other's kids and and that became impossible I think shortly after that Jersey con but the Jersey one was awful because the weather was lovely and every

218
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,220
Nobody wanted to be in the room looking after the kids.

219
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,780
Everyone wanted to be out at the zoo and we should probably have just moved the crash outside.

220
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,140
Probably.

221
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,660
Um But we didn't know we didn't know any better.

222
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
And how so so how have your kids found that they they've been enjoying it?

223
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,080
They've enjoyed the art show?

224
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,120
They've they uh they have been seen several times running in circles round the art show.

225
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,480
uh stopping to admire it.

226
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
Um my son has expensive taste.

227
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,240
He's picked out some prints he really likes and I went a hundred and fifty quid.

228
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,839
But but you've won a Hugo now so

229
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,960
They don't actually give you any money for those.

230
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,440
Oh, if you sell that rocket on eBay, you don't sell the Hugo.

231
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm not selling my Hugo.

232
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:03,080
In the audience we have uh Esther who was chair of WorldCon the year that I won the Hugo and she is very upset.

233
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,400
It's a very good Hugo.

234
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,320
I've I've k no I'm not I've not sold mine.

235
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,520
You've not sold yours.

236
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,080
I I have not sold any of my Hugo.

237
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,399
Hugo's Don't let me let me get a chair done.

238
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,360
Esther is asking us not to um

239
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,120
have make her hide under the furniture again.

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:38,720
So I wanted to and I wanted to ask like how has your experience as a guest of honor, like what has changed at a convention that you're guest of honor at versus 'cause you were at the Glasgow WorldCon, so this isn't your first convention as a

241
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,380
sort of an a a a member.

242
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,460
So how does being a guest of honour sort of change your experience?

243
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,900
Well, I think the one I'll compare to actually was

244
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:56,140
Dublin WorldCon, which I went to when I only had one book out, and I wasn't sure uh it was only just out, I think it had been out for about a month.

245
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,500
And one little novella, uh American publisher with terrible UK distribution

246
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,480
and terrible Ireland distribution.

247
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:12,840
And uh no one had heard of it and I didn't know what I was doing and I didn't know anyone and it was very loud and very crowded and I had a terrible time, which is not at all Dublin's fault.

248
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,280
I'm just not good at loud and crowded and I don't know what I'm doing.

249
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,080
I had a fantastic time at Glasgow.

250
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,720
Not just because it was a brilliant convention, although it was, uh but also

251
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:34,500
Actually, I think I had a suspicion that the the voting for some desperate glory had gone quite well because people kept congratulating me or saying or saying nice things to me

252
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,320
before anything, before the Hugo ceremony.

253
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:44,600
Um and it it is very different to a TenderCon as an author whose book people have read.

254
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,800
than it is to attend a con at the very start of your career when you don't know anybody.

255
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,280
So that was already a change.

256
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,720
And then that was also when I figured out cons are better if you do stuff.

257
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,840
Yes, a hundred percent.

258
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,040
So much better if you do stuff.

259
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
So I did the most recent

260
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,579
Eastercon in Belfast last year and I signed up to be on everything I could think of.

261
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,339
And I had a wonderful time.

262
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,380
Uh and I I actually I love to be on a panel

263
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:14,720
uh because I had this tenure career in teaching which gave me a d a dreadful taste for a captive audience.

264
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,000
Yes, you put me in a room and they all have to be quiet while I talk

265
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,040
I'm doing this.

266
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:32,319
So how did that so you and and and so you obviously you've won a Hugo Award for your fan cast, which is um the eight days of Diana Wynne Jones

267
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,860
But d so how do you find that because obviously you've still got the captive audience but you can't see them.

268
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,899
And so is that a very different experience or is it a similar experience?

269
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:46,819
I mean I do have one member of my captive audience whom I can see who is my co-host Becker on the other end of the

270
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:48,060
Video call.

271
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,100
Becca is very understanding about this.

272
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,019
But um video

273
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,720
Eight is Dana Wyn Jones is essentially a book club.

274
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:07,800
It's the two of us who are very old friends uh and who are both big fans of Jones' work and have been since we were children uh rereading all her books and talking about them.

275
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,000
And it is

276
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,460
Absolutely wonderful fun.

277
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,900
It's the best thing in the world.

278
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,060
And I was like, oh I love podcasting.

279
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,300
I am not doing anything technical, anything on the audio side.

280
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,060
In fact my audio was

281
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,380
So bad for such a long time that someone came up to Becca at a con and offered to buy me a mic.

282
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,060
They were like, please.

283
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,580
And uh

284
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:43,300
one of my brother's co-workers came to him and said, Look, I've written down what she needs to get the right they all they m because he's Tesh and I'm Tesh and he works in sort of nerd adjacent stuff

285
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,360
Um they all knew and had like got to tell Emily this is the microphone she needs to buy.

286
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,360
Uh so yes, I'm a very amateurish podcaster, but I do love to talk.

287
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,640
I do love to yap.

288
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:06,120
Podcasting came from that background in my head, and so I'm I'm very um I'm very sym sympathetic the wrong word, but I think one of the great strengths of the medium is that anyone can do it and

289
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:15,559
I think obviously the Better Producer Podcast is is is lovely, but it's the the ability to have um people give ideas who aren't on radio four that's the strength.

290
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:16,039
And so

291
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:24,740
I obviously we try and make Ox Thought sound as good as we can, but like we're not, you know, w when we were starting, I had like a very, very bad microphone.

292
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:32,280
and and sort of I think the first episode we recorded you were on AirPods and Liz didn't upgrade her pod her podcasting microphone until we'd won a Hugo Award.

293
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,080
That was her threshold.

294
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,600
She was like now I am ready.

295
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,679
I'm with Liz

296
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:48,660
I'm with Liz, that's exactly when I was like, okay, yes, fine, I can go and in terms of liking to talk, I did I asked John why did you ask me to be on your podcast?

297
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,140
And

298
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,120
He umdenared and then he finally admitted that he'd asked several other people and they'd all said no.

299
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,160
I had not I had not asked several other people and I asked I I had asked at least one other person.

300
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,640
Okay.

301
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,160
And then he said but then I just thought who do I know who's really loud.

302
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,880
As soon as I thought of you it made it was like, oh no, okay, I should have thought that very much sooner.

303
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,080
Um but yes.

304
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,720
Yeah.

305
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,840
So so um

306
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,500
Yeah, no, I wanted to b ask a bit about podcasting.

307
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,980
So what made you think, oh yes, we want to do a podcast and w why a close read of Diana rather than

308
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,059
a bunch of 'cause I'm very uh you know, Diana used to come to conventions, we knew her.

309
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,260
I envy you.

310
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:36,980
One of the great regrets of my life is that I never met this author whose work I admire so much that I never even wrote to her to tell her how much it mattered to me.

311
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:43,100
me I think when you're a teenager you you don't appreciate that people aren't going to be there forever.

312
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,820
Um but her work has meant so so much to me.

313
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,940
But what actually happened in terms of starting a podcast was it was a blue sky conversation.

314
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:56,700
Uh Becca posted, one of these days I am going to Cave and I will start my Diana Wynne Jones podcast.

315
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,419
And I said, our Diana Wynne Jones podcast.

316
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,779
So uh I signed I signed myself up for it

317
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:07,480
And in doing so I think uh forced her to to take it seriously.

318
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,960
She I think she only mo posted it as a joke.

319
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,840
Um but I was like, we are doing this, this would be great.

320
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,960
And the real the real draw actually was Book Club with Becca.

321
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,320
Which is a thing I love to do.

322
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,680
Uh and we do not only read Jones together.

323
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,400
Um we recently actually before last Eastercon I was on an ANIA panel.

324
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:27,519
Um, which was wonderful, brilliant.

325
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,840
But I was like, Becca, I'm going to reread all of Narnia.

326
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,880
Do you want to join me?

327
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,320
Uh so she did.

328
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,080
Um and we read, we

329
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,560
We book club quite a lot of John LeCarey together.

330
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,560
So, you know, if we finished Dina Wynne Jones, we could do eight days of John LeCarey.

331
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,200
The most depressing podcast imaginable.

332
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,320
Now uh uh you've just anticipated my next question, which is when you finish

333
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
Diana's work where you go next.

334
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,320
Well, we might take a break.

335
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,600
Um not from reading together because we're friends who read a lot of things together.

336
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,900
uh but from podcasting which does take more time than I realized.

337
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,860
Uh we were so I mean we we had no idea what we were doing when we started and it shows

338
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,980
Um but in fact we do take the conversations very seriously, so we do a lot of reading round the books.

339
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,420
Um for the most recent episode we recorded, which isn't up yet, was on Castle in the Air, the sequel to How's Moving Castle.

340
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:31,140
So we read uh the 19th century Burton translation of Arabian Knights and uh Edward Saeed's nineteen seventy-eight book Orientalism and some other things.

341
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,200
Uh we like to read for the podcast.

342
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,560
So it's we're not just reading Jones, we're reading quite a lot around Jones because she is such an intellectual writer.

343
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,120
She's doing so much on so many layers.

344
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
Um I forgot the question, I got too excited.

345
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,840
What what what might you do once you've once you've exhausted the original concept?

346
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,480
Um

347
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,540
Well but I guess the alternate question is do you think you ever will exhaust the original.

348
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,820
I think it's a project that

349
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,760
It's it's a nice thought to have a project that is finishable.

350
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,120
I love finishing things.

351
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,680
Yeah.

352
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,480
When you said we might take a break, I was like, oh

353
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,279
That sounds lovely.

354
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,840
So we might take a break.

355
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,679
And then and then we might pick pick a different author and do some more.

356
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:19,919
Yeah.

357
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,279
Because we do have fun.

358
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,639
Interesting.

359
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,440
Um and so

360
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:35,640
And uh so the other thing you won a Hugo Award for uh was Some Desperate Glory, your your debut novel, um which I would describe as a certified banger.

361
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,799
Um so so fun fact we did an Octothorpe episode which you can go and find where we talked about the Hugo

362
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,220
contenders that year and I'm I'm really sorry.

363
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,300
The other two put it first and I put it second.

364
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,460
But anyway, overall it was definitely our top.

365
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,180
And I was the six I was I actually

366
00:22:52,440 --> 00:23:00,120
persuaded Liz round you cause cause Liz I think was dithering and I was like no you are wrong this one is the best one and here is why on the episode.

367
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,639
I'm not sure I agree.

368
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,360
I thought it was a very strong year which is a part of why I was so surprised to win

369
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,039
No, I mean I would have been I would have been happy with other books.

370
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,559
No, I wouldn't have been happy.

371
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:13,720
I would have respected it if I would have been.

372
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,500
Call it there were six books on that thing and I'd have been happy if three of them are of any of three of them were one.

373
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:23,820
If any of the other three of them were one, I would have stormed the Hugo ceremony with pitchforks.

374
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,860
Uh I'm not gonna say that partly 'cause no, anyway, let's move on.

375
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,100
Uh don't say every thought out loud, John.

376
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:40,580
Um but no so so Also the other great thing about podcasting before we get off is that you can say every thought out loud while you are recording the podcast.

377
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,360
And then j know know deep in your heart that John will take some of those thoughts out.

378
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
And the generally speaking the correct ones.

379
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,960
Um yes.

380
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,040
Sometimes I leave them in because it's funnier.

381
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:58,580
Um and there's sometimes 'cause 'cause APRO says very quickly um we record the podcast which takes two hours for a podcast that normally runs forty five minutes.

382
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,720
And then John edits it and then he sends it back round to us and then we listen to it and say, Yeah, no John, that was perfect edit.

383
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:13,160
I don't know how you do it, you're amazing 'cause we just talk rubbish for two hours and you've made this lovely thing and sometimes we go, Oh no, no, that's not staying in

384
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh yeah, no, yep, yep, that is uh that is fair.

385
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,080
And so that's the amount of work it is.

386
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,600
Um do we pre-read?

387
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,760
No, sort of.

388
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,960
You do the most pre-reading on occasions where we pre-read

389
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:33,380
Yeah, we've never because I like coming to texts cold and just experiencing them as they are without seeking out the

390
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,260
things they're in conversation with in advance and you very much like doing the reverse.

391
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,780
And I think that is good because it gives us different perspectives on the texts we discuss when we discuss them.

392
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:50,220
Yes, if I'm if I read a book that is supposed to be a retelling of something I read when I was twelve, I I always try to read

393
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:57,960
thing that 'cause it's I uh it it turns out so when you read a book when you're twelve and you read a book when you're sixty, it you make

394
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,060
different you take different things from it.

395
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,260
Have you noticed this?

396
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,580
I have noticed this, yes.

397
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,540
Yes.

398
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,060
But but when you're rereading when you're doing your close reading of

399
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,720
Diana's work in the U.

400
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:09,880
S.

401
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,760
There's so much in there that just uh went straight over my head at age fifteen or whatever.

402
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,760
Um there is some books of hers which I think this was published as a children's book.

403
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:21,320
How?

404
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:21,639
Yeah.

405
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,840
Have you read Redshift?

406
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,580
I have not yet.

407
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:24,740
No.

408
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,020
No, no, you must sorry, you must read Redshift by Alan Garner when you get a chance.

409
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,860
He'd be a great person to do a close read of.

410
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,420
But also Redshift by Alan Garner is the book

411
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,520
in the entire canon of children's work, which is least like a children's novel, in my opinion.

412
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,640
I was gonna

413
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:46,840
I was gonna ask you a specific question on coming back to text as an adult, which is I decided I hated the Silmarillion when I was fourteen.

414
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,360
Should I go back to it?

415
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:58,260
I mean I feel like I can't in good conscience recommend the Silmarillion so much as like this this has rewritten my brain for my entire life.

416
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,540
I don't think I have a an answer that makes sense.

417
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,100
Yeah.

418
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:02,740
Um

419
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,720
I do think it's wonderful.

420
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,320
I think it's brilliant.

421
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:14,399
I think, like, to read as a book, honestly, Lord of the Rings is a better novel by

422
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,780
Some some some way.

423
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,940
Because that was it actually doing a novel.

424
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,260
Yes.

425
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:25,940
Uh the Silmarillion it was never trying to be a novel, it's trying to be a history, it's uh a mythology

426
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:33,480
Um it sort of it it does intentionally sort of ascend and approach the the the biblical in tone in many places.

427
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,440
I love it.

428
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,559
I think it's gorgeous and there's also so much in it.

429
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,679
There's so much there that just catches the imagination.

430
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Um, and there's some that some of it that like uh stuff I didn't get to talk about at Desert Island Discs when it was one of my books.

431
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,299
Um there's a title books, sorry.

432
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:59,419
Um The Chapter of the Fifth Battle of the Neonith and Anoidiad, where you have this description

433
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:08,780
of what it is like to be on a battlefield that was once green grass and is turning into churning mud that will never change back.

434
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,500
And

435
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:20,380
All around you, the breath of the dragons, the poisonous breath, and a generation of beauty and hope disappearing in the mud and their bones left there.

436
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,100
And this is a description of the trenches to me.

437
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,300
And it's I mean, I I do feel in a way the the

438
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:37,039
Gerard Tolkien, I think, experienced horror in the First World War and then spent fifty years trying to process it through the medium of elves.

439
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,159
And I respect him for it.

440
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,559
I also process things through the medium of elves.

441
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:52,480
Um I think your description of it at Desert Island Books was what made me think I should probably go back and revisit that because I think that as a child I did not

442
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,340
necessarily pick up on all of the interesting things about it.

443
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,420
I mean parts of it are hard going.

444
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:04,780
There's a chapter of the realms of Beliriand which I think you can skip and just look at the map in the front of the book for the same effect.

445
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,300
But it's it's wonderful, it's exquisite.

446
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,260
Do go back to it.

447
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:22,680
big difficult books that are like that though where where some parts of them the there are parts of them are excellent like the curate.

448
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,600
Um and and you you kind of have to

449
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:38,960
accept when you're reading them that some of that is in order to get the full benefit of the thing that is good, some you need to read some things that are maybe not speaking to you quite as much.

450
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,360
Some books are hard work.

451
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:49,080
And I think the idea of having to work for it for your reading, for your entertainment, for your delight.

452
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,179
It's it's the good kind of work, right?

453
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:58,539
It's what comes out the other end is a greater satisfaction because you worked for that understanding and for that relationship with the text.

454
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:07,880
But if what you actually want is it's the end of a day and I would like to be entertained for thirty minutes before I go to bed, then that is not the kind of book that you need.

455
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:14,240
And it can be, I think, a little bit stressful trying to assess is this a thirty minutes or thirty minutes of peaceful entertainment book?

456
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,080
Or is this a book that's going to be transcendent but I'm gonna have to slave for it?

457
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,080
Oh yeah, I think that's that's fair.

458
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,200
And I think it

459
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:30,280
Uh the other thing I think is that there's a a thing here where I'm a scientist by trade and so whenever I read a paper you have to work to get the information out of it.

460
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,880
That represents the author failing to communicate their ideas effectively

461
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:39,980
Because papers should be easy to read because it's not about the work of discerning what the scientists are trying to tell you.

462
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,060
It's about thinking about what the scientist has found.

463
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,900
And so in my field I think

464
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,440
It's very different.

465
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,680
Whereas I think working to come to a creative text is very different.

466
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,280
And I think that shapes my I think I'm beginning to

467
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,919
examine those two as very separate things whereas before I was lumping them all together in an unhelpful way.

468
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,919
Um but yes.

469
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,120
I think a lot of the work of reading fiction or reading a creative text of any kind

470
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:13,799
um is the it's it's a it's a two-way street, that's what the author is giving you, but that's also what the reader is bringing.

471
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:24,760
Um and the reader's own experience and own uh knowledge of reading and what they've read before can add so much weight and depth and beauty to a text and the author doesn't control any of that.

472
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,440
Uh uh a book is a

473
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:35,740
Two-way conversation in which the author attempts to provoke a detailed hallucination and the reader consents to have the detailed hallucination, but in their own way.

474
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,100
Um and

475
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,980
That means that there's there is work that a reader has to do in fiction always.

476
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:47,380
And it's the question of how how much the author chooses to disguise it.

477
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna segue from there into you uh inducing detailed hallucinations in your readers.

478
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,120
Um and I basically I want to ask you a question about Sum Desperate Gloria and the Incandescent, which is

479
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:11,600
We I went to your Guest of Honor interview and you were talking about Kia and Safi as potentially um characters who make mistakes and characters who are flawed.

480
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,680
But I wanted to ask you, what do you like about Kia and what do you like about Safi?

481
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,280
They're so funny.

482
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:26,480
This is I mean I I think this is not necessarily the case for everyone who reads the books, but for me writing them I was like, oh this is so funny.

483
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:29,760
Um I I enjoy watching an entertaining fuck up

484
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:40,460
Um which is which is a lot of what the both books are is a person making a series of understandable but very silly mistakes

485
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,360
Uh and to me it is comedy.

486
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,160
Uh I I r I I do rem no genuinely I remember talking to

487
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,920
It was to the lovely Everina, I think, who is there in the audience, uh, about some desperate glory.

488
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,440
And I was like, well, of course it's got to be in a limited point of view, because the whole joke is that Kia has a limited point of view.

489
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,440
And she said, Do you mean the theme?

490
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,159
Uh a genre's a genre's just mega jokes.

491
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,039
John's up j John's on tilt.

492
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:26,039
Well 'cause I heard you sa I we you were talking about mega text in your Joe H and shoe and that made my brain go in certain ways, but now the idea that I c

493
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,120
Expert for fun.

494
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,920
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

495
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:41,080
And uh part of the play is that you're taking it very seriously and there are rules that are not to be broken.

496
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,760
Diana Wynne Jones wrote an essay about this because she was a genius.

497
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:52,420
But within the world of play and fantasy, you are actually taking it very seriously in order to enjoy it even more.

498
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:59,540
And I think the play, the joke, the the um and the the share the community nature of it.

499
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:05,960
that you and the author across time and space are having this game together where you where you play let's pretend.

500
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,520
Let's pretend we're in space.

501
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,340
Let's pretend we're at the magic school.

502
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:17,220
Uh and I do think there's an element of joy and fun, even in some of the the the darkest fiction out there.

503
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,080
But then I also call the theme the joke.

504
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,919
I I yeah no I I'm gonna have to let that fizz for a little bit in my head and th yeah.

505
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,799
But that's good.

506
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,679
I I

507
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,880
Really the th one of the things I really liked about both of these novels is that I read quite a lot of books and most

508
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:42,780
Most protagonists in most fiction and especially in most genre fiction are kind of mostly competent.

509
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,980
They they might kind of

510
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:51,880
screw up now and then but they kind of know what's gonna they have a sense of the world that basically knows what's going on in the world.

511
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,760
Keir and Safi really don't know what's going on around them.

512
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,399
And

513
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,799
Yeah actually I think most people don't know what's going around on around them.

514
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,679
I think most of us have enormous blind spots.

515
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:07,399
So it's

516
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:15,340
quite interesting that you've written protagonists who have enormous blind spots because people are like that but most protagonists are not really like that.

517
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,860
I think one mode of genre fiction

518
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:30,640
Which goes back a long way, which which in fact you could say goes to Tolkien and those who came before him as well, is uh essentially of the fantasy or science fiction writer as a kind of travel writer

519
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:38,220
Uh and you read a a book of travel writing and it's about a place you've never been, but you're going there now through this book.

520
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:43,579
Uh with the assistance of your wonderful guide, the author, who of course is not lying to you.

521
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:53,299
Even in nonfiction sometimes the author is lying to you, intentionally or not.

522
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:02,740
Um but I think there can be such uh a real delight in the the travelogue mode of speculative fiction of

523
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,240
entering into this wonderful world, this wonderful setting.

524
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:15,120
Um which means that you're not necessarily looking at your guide, your narrator, your protagonist, your author and going, wait, hang on a second.

525
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,880
Do I trust you?

526
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,819
Do you know what you're talking about?

527
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:23,220
But in fact, quite a lot of people have no idea what they're talking about at any given time.

528
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,660
Certainly I don't.

529
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,220
Um

530
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:34,800
And I enjoy in writing and in characters um that uncertainty, that limited perspective, those blind spots.

531
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,080
They're funny to me.

532
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,840
Again, it's comedy.

533
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,280
It's a joke.

534
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,080
Yeah.

535
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,660
I think that makes a lot of sense.

536
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:48,300
And I think I think one of the things I love I love so much about both Kia and Safi is you can see exactly how they got where they were from

537
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,840
what the environment that's being described around them.

538
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:02,160
Like I was having an argument in the pub on on Thursday with someone who said that he didn't like a T V series 'cause he thought the characters were unbelievable and it boiled down to they hadn't behaved absolutely rationally at every step of the plot.

539
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,600
And I was like, they are they are human

540
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,960
How does he cope with real life?

541
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,080
I don't know.

542
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,600
I didn't ask him that.

543
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,200
Um but yes.

544
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,200
But I think this is a

545
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:19,800
This is something you do very well that i I think those blind spots and and portraying characters uh with those blind spots but

546
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:26,140
in a sympathetic way, 'cause I'm sympathetic to Kier even as she is being awful through some desperate glory.

547
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:42,100
I in both of these books I read the book really without knowing that people thought the main character was awful and I because I was systematically lied to and indoctrinated by adult I think most people were, but

548
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:48,200
I was so I was I found Kia very relatable and I reached young adulthood.

549
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,760
Um some of the people in the audience knew me then.

550
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,619
with what I describe as plus three armour of intellectual arrogance.

551
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,180
So I found Safi very relatable.

552
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,060
And and and and I don't

553
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:09,520
I didn't dislike either until I started reading reviews and people were like, these characters are awful and I was like, Oh I I really like and I don't know what that says about me.

554
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:18,260
The the incandescent, I've said this before, is in many ways a hundred and fifteen thousand word call-out post for a certain kind of person.

555
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,299
And there's a lot of them who read books.

556
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,859
Um but I

557
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,360
I really like both characters as well.

558
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:35,560
I I I I was shocked by how strongly people rejected uh Kia at her very worst.

559
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,880
And I like and how to do that.

560
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,460
Strongly some readers reacted to her because she behaves badly.

561
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:48,260
She absolutely behaves badly and she believes awful things and she does awful things.

562
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,340
And she is

563
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:59,800
uh knowingly and willingly and enthusiastically a a young terrorist, um and she is an abuse victim.

564
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,920
And I think I think the book is very clear that she's an abuse victim, but a lot of people seem to miss it.

565
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,720
Um

566
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,640
I think it can be hard to read generously, and that's because reading generously is hard work.

567
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,060
See what I said earlier.

568
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,900
Sometimes you don't want your book to be work.

569
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,700
You would you would like to sit down quietly and enjoy yourself and be taken on a nice bit of travel.

570
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,060
Um but

571
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:33,180
I tr I certainly try to read generously and to give books, authors, the benefit of assuming they know what they're doing.

572
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,500
uh when they when they begin the journey.

573
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:46,220
When I thought I think so I think one of the things I loved in um The Incandescent, there's a there's a scene towards the end where um someone tells a character

574
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,599
lots of Safi's flaws and the character says, Yes, I know all of that.

575
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:59,000
Um and I'm like, I like that moment I'm trying to be not too spoilery, but I I like that moment where it's like, well yes, you love the people you love

576
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,880
You don't love them and wish they were not flawed.

577
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,280
You love them because of who they are and that includes their flaws.

578
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,680
Yes.

579
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,120
Um and I thought that was very powerful.

580
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,520
I also love there's there's one and I don't

581
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:10,359
I assume this was on purpose because you're very clever.

582
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,599
Um so I'm I'm cheerfully assuming that this is a concept.

583
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,040
Oh no, I make mistakes all the time.

584
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:16,200
Well there's a point where you refer to

585
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,320
Things aren't mutually exclusive.

586
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,120
Absolutely right.

587
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,760
Yes.

588
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,600
Um but there's a point where you refer to like masking in an um autistic or an ADHD sense as shielding.

589
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:35,720
Uh like that or I I read it like that where there's a character who says, Oh, I've been shielding hard and I was like, it would make absolute sense that in a magical community where you have literal shields you would refer to that.

590
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,400
a shielding and I that that jumped out of the page at me and sort of slapped me and whistled, This is good and I was like yes.

591
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,000
Um I just want to say that.

592
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,040
There's no question there.

593
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,200
That's just uh that's just that's a compliment.

594
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,680
And and and I have one more thing to say about the incandescent which I did warn.

595
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,440
Emily about in the bar.

596
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,360
Which is um so one of the things that um this novel is talking about is Oxbridge and

597
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,440
the way in which elite well elite schools as well as elite universities work.

598
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,080
And but one of the characters is described as

599
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,020
coming from Wanker College.

600
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:18,020
And I just want to say self-described as coming and apparently I also come from Wanker College.

601
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,100
And I I felt this was

602
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,900
Perhaps a slightly no it wasn't.

603
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,980
It's it was totally like, oh my God.

604
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,540
So many wankers at my college.

605
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,260
I don't know if that can stay in the podcast.

606
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,780
Apple doesn't I don't know what

607
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:37,060
Apple like that.

608
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,820
But we're quoting a literary text.

609
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,940
It's right there on the page.

610
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,900
So I was one of I was in the second year that

611
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,579
John's in had women as i as college members.

612
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,779
So it was and it was quite a strange place.

613
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,980
Um and it definitely had some people who are

614
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:01,780
like your extremely what's it asshole sand asshole sandwich?

615
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,660
The arsehole sandwich.

616
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,460
The arsehole sandwich.

617
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,980
Oh gosh, I have to

618
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:08,700
I will I will tell the arsehole sandwich anecdote in a moment uh 'cause it makes me laugh every time.

619
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:11,740
But I'll talk about I'll talk about the banker college thing first.

620
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,380
So uh

621
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,720
For my sins, I also uh went to Cambridge and I was at Trinity College, which is next door to St.

622
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,600
John's.

623
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,640
Um and they are old rivals, actually.

624
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,960
Um and everyone I knew at St.

625
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:27,319
John's College was perfectly lovely and very nice to me.

626
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,960
Uh I even had a lovely boyfriend who was a Jonian.

627
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,480
Uh I but

628
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:43,280
I was also aware of the college's reputation, which didn't seem to have anything to do with the actual people, and it was the reputation of the Wanker College, and there was a little song about it.

629
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,440
Should I sing the song?

630
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,520
Yes, absolutely you should sing the song.

631
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,480
Absolutely you should sing the song.

632
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,600
It goes like this.

633
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,840
I'd rather be at Oxford than St.

634
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,480
John's.

635
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,400
I'd rather be at Oxford than St.

636
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,200
John's.

637
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,620
I'd rather be at Oxford.

638
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,980
Oh I'd rather be at Oxford.

639
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,060
I would rather be at Oxford than St John's.

640
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,660
Repeat forever.

641
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,540
Yes.

642
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,980
So my So I have an anecdote that I probably need to say in the bar, but the reason and I'm gonna say it now.

643
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,900
The reason I was at St John's is that I had

644
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:17,180
plus the armour of intellectual arrogance and I went from my to kind of go tour around colleges fairly sure that I would probably get into Cambridge.

645
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,660
And I went to Trinity and they said

646
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:30,380
Oh, the thing is we had we take fifty mathematicians a year and we always make sure that there's one woman so that it looks all right because there aren't really 'cause obviously women can't do maths, but we take one, but we've

647
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,500
got our one for this year.

648
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:39,260
So and and then I went next door to St John's and I met the chap at St John's and he said, we've already made an offer to a woman for this year.

649
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:39,820
And

650
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,420
And I went next door and they were like, we it's our second year of having women.

651
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,340
We would love nothing more than to be able to admit more female mathematicians.

652
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,300
It would be the best thing.

653
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,140
And they omitted two, one of whom's my great friend Ruth who some of you know.

654
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,860
Um but

655
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,400
But that's why I was at Sid John.

656
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,160
So that was not a wankerish experience.

657
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,720
Not at all.

658
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I mean that honestly that does sound like Trinity.

659
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,040
And and I would say I I and I knew when I was at

660
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:12,740
Because I was in the Cambridge University Science Fiction Society, um, I did know a lot of Trinity mathematicians, and I'd love to be able to say that they were all perfect lovely people, but they really weren't.

661
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,460
I mean Well I mean to be fair though, they were mathematicians.

662
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,860
Some of them, some of them

663
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,740
were lovely, lovely people.

664
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,539
And some of them were as much the strangest human beings I have ever met.

665
00:43:24,779 --> 00:43:25,819
And you should have known these

666
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,980
people because then you could have put them in your books.

667
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,339
We have in the audience Rosanna who I believe has relevant expertise here.

668
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,420
Trinity mathematicians, what do you think?

669
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,200
Hi Ed.

670
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,920
Hello Ed.

671
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,839
But I mean seriously, I mean how Ed's How many how many people in the audience were Trinity mathematicians?

672
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:47,720
No, none?

673
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:48,119
There we go.

674
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,000
But I'm shocked.

675
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,200
Shocked I am.

676
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,839
Shocked I am that out of this

677
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,779
So, I think that's a good idea.

678
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:14,859
You were doing natural science Alston was doing natural sciences and Mike was at Robinson doing maths and I am going to gently suggest that this part is less interesting.

679
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:16,940
We're doing the thing, let's stop

680
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,240
I eat.

681
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,920
No, can I do the arsehole sandwich anecdote?

682
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,400
Because this is funny to me.

683
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,320
Um so there are parts of the incandescent which are drawn from life.

684
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,200
I think this is not very surprising to anyone who's read the book and met any of the kinds of people there.

685
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:38,780
Uh but one of them is this uh this ex Jonian, Mark, uh gives a description of himself as a uh he's

686
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:52,400
uh offering himself basically as a romantic prospect and he says listen when you first meet me I may seem like an arseh but actually if you get to know me better you'll find that I have hidden depths

687
00:44:52,799 --> 00:45:04,319
uh and there are secrets about me and I have a real passion for magic and I'm interesting and uh a little bit lonely and then if you really get to know me right deep down at the bottom of my soul

688
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,980
You'll find the same asshole you spotted in the first place.

689
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,220
I'm like a sandwich.

690
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,660
But the thing is, this conversation

691
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,160
is not the product of my wonderful creative brain.

692
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,480
A a man said that to me in real life.

693
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,080
Wow.

694
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,600
And you put him in your books.

695
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,160
He I mean Mark is not that guy.

696
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,160
Mark just borrowed that line 'cause like

697
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,220
Why would you say that?

698
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,580
It's a heck of the line.

699
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,260
It's it's it's it's an interesting one.

700
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:40,500
So I was gonna ask like how much of the ink because I know I know obviously you were um at at Cambridge and then and then you were um a teacher.

701
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,920
So how much of the incandescent is autobiographical?

702
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,240
I mean both all of it and none of it.

703
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:47,800
Um

704
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,000
So Safi is not me.

705
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,119
I need to put it out there.

706
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,720
I feel I feel sometimes I feel a bit like um Charlotte Bronte explained that Jane Eyre is not herself when people kept introducing her as Jane.

707
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:01,119
Um which is a thing that happened

708
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:01,339
Poor woman.

709
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,500
Uh no, Safi Walton is not me.

710
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:06,940
I hope, I really hope I am not quite that arrogant.

711
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,940
Um but she does have quite a lot of my backstory.

712
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:11,740
Um

713
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:20,760
Like her, I went to a fairly fancy school, not I will say, as fancy as Chetwood, which is the next level up from what I'm familiar with.

714
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,240
Um

715
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:30,140
Chetwood is sort of a mid-range boarding school, not terribly good academically, but it has a history.

716
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:35,500
Um the kind of place you send your kids if you couldn't get them into Eaton or Harrow.

717
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:44,480
Big chunks of the book are taken not directly from life, but from things I saw, from things I knew, from the kinds of people I've met.

718
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:53,820
It had a system I know very, very well, which is elite education, which is something I lived in for 30 years and then came out of and went, what the hell was that?

719
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,579
Um and there is a there there are specific details I've drawn directly from life.

720
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,420
The arsehole sandwich was one.

721
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,859
The teacher who secretly has full-sleeve tattoos that none of the students know about

722
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,600
is a colleague of mine, was a colleague of mine.

723
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,680
She was very, very cool.

724
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,360
And they didn't know.

725
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,560
I wanted the environment especially to feel very lived in, very real.

726
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,960
There's a map at the start of the book.

727
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,300
Which I sent map.

728
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:28,619
I sent the the wonderful artist Virginia Allen, I sent uh for reference both like my hand drawn

729
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,800
very rubbish and ugly map which laid out the school grounds and then a bunch of school prospectus maps.

730
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,520
And I was like, listen, this book needs a fantasy map.

731
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,600
And when I say fantasy map I mean proper fantasy map because that's what

732
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,220
boarding school is.

733
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,740
It's a fantasy.

734
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,339
It's a theme park.

735
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,619
It's an imaginary place of

736
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,960
Beauty and safety and your children will be so prestigious after this.

737
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,160
And you'll have spent loads and loads of money, but it will be worth it because they'll be happy.

738
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,260
Right?

739
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:07,660
Which

740
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,480
And he just wasn't bumping into her.

741
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,400
Which I think is so funny.

742
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,520
My my my dad is my dad is uh he's an interesting chap.

743
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,280
Uh and that when he told me that I was like, that doesn't make any sense, dad.

744
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,400
And he was like, why not?

745
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,280
She could have been.

746
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,100
Like that's how it works.

747
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,060
So anyway, yeah.

748
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:37,300
One of the books I read um in the run-up to writing The Incandescent was a book called Sad Little Men.

749
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:47,280
by I can't remember the author, but it was a memoir about attending Radley, which is another of the big boarding schools, um, and it described the

750
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:58,000
I mean it obviously it it is completely mad for your parents to drop you off and then not reappear for months and describe the sense of betrayal that the author felt.

751
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,619
and kept ever after towards his mother and also women in general.

752
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,340
specifically all male environments of which there are not many left now.

753
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,260
Rugby takes girls.

754
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:20,300
Um but uh I found it an interesting read and in some ways like it

755
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:33,500
followed directly on from some desperate desperate glory in that both books are about a closed community creating a certain kind of person and intentionally blinding those people to everything else the world can be.

756
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:34,760
Yeah.

757
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,160
It's interesting in interesting um uh shared joke.

758
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,880
In the sense of theme.

759
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,880
Though m yeah, meta joke.

760
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,080
Metajoke metajoke.

761
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:48,680
Um

762
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,520
I wanted to ask so I'm I'm aware that we're coming sort of inexorably to the end.

763
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:01,920
Uh we've got probably twenty minutes before we will be um driven off the stage by pitchforks wielded by Esther and Nolly.

764
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:09,120
Um but I wanted to ask very quickly before we do picks about games because we like games and this is Octothorpe Gaming Corner.

765
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,040
Um so games, you like games.

766
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:11,840
I like games.

767
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:12,880
What games do you like?

768
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,000
I like games very much.

769
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,080
Uh what am I playing at the moment?

770
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,220
I have I've finished playing through Hades 2.

771
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,260
Uh which that's very odd.

772
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,220
I don't think we've actually left enough time for me to talk about all my

773
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,500
opinions about Hades 2.

774
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,060
That's alright.

775
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,460
We'll just I don't know what's next on the program, but I will someone someone bar the doors.

776
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,980
Uh we're just gonna do this.

777
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:35,980
Okay.

778
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,220
No I mean because um

779
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:47,540
Hades and Hades II back to back are two games inspired by Greek mythology.

780
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,380
And I think to make

781
00:50:49,980 --> 00:51:02,780
One game which at its core is thematically about you, the hero, with your youth and courage, can reconcile with the abusive patriarch and then everything will be fine.

782
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:10,040
But to make two games about you with your youth and courage need to reconcile with the abusive patriarch and everything will be fine.

783
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,760
This seems like an intentional, determined, committed

784
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:23,240
um artistic direction which is about have you considered there must be a way to reconcile with the abusive old man?

785
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,280
And it is

786
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:33,140
baffling to me as a choice for how to work with the material they're working the classical material they're taking from ancient myth.

787
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,740
I mean a lot of what they're doing with ancient myth is

788
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,160
Weird anyway 'cause the Hades games are very sexy.

789
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,960
I'm gonna put that there.

790
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:43,680
Everyone is hot.

791
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:44,319
Oh yeah yeah.

792
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,920
Everyone is very, very hot

793
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:54,059
Um and you the hero can have all sorts of romances simultaneously with all sorts of people of uh any gender.

794
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,780
And none of them will be upset in any way.

795
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,100
Uh but you're also seeing someone else.

796
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,740
So you you have your wonderful queer polycule.

797
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,100
Have a great time with it.

798
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:04,660
Um

799
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:11,580
There is never any sense of sexuality as problem, sexuality as threat.

800
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,380
Good news, Hades did not rape Persephone.

801
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,580
That's it that's that's it's all fine.

802
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,060
It's all fine.

803
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,020
They get back together.

804
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:17,900
It's fine.

805
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:18,460
Um

806
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:23,980
And it's fascinating to me as um oh they they cut all the incest as well.

807
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:28,940
Uh it's fascinating by other treatment of the material to say, yes, we want to keep

808
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:35,800
Um sexiness from ancient Greek myth, but take out everything that's scary or threatening.

809
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,720
When in fact so much of Greek myth is threatening sexuality.

810
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,840
I enjoyed both games very much.

811
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,640
They're fun to play.

812
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,160
I'm not good at them, to be clear.

813
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,560
I am not good at any game unless it involves optimizing a spreadsheet and I'm brilliant at it.

814
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,400
Good, good, correct.

815
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,360
Um that was that was

816
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:02,079
I I I have I haven't started Hades 2 yet because I did three hundred hours in a week and a half and and not probably

817
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,319
I I I basically played Hades all of the all of my waking moments for until it was properly done.

818
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,200
So I haven't started Hades 2 yet, but I have um if you like optimizing

819
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:17,460
spreadsheets I can recommend a game called Blueprints which we have mentioned multiple times.

820
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,940
I was gr I was really good at that one.

821
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,580
I had a lot of fun with blueprints.

822
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:28,920
On the subject of optimizing spreadsheets, do you play much in the way of analogue games or are you mostly video game focused?

823
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,079
I'm mostly video game focused.

824
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:34,020
Um in general I'm not good with my hands.

825
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,000
On

826
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,900
If it's moving stuff around or holding stuff, uh I get frustrated very easily.

827
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:40,819
Uh like I can do a keyboard.

828
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:41,779
That's fair.

829
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,539
No I I think we're talking about board games where you don't need a lot of

830
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,600
No, you e even then I actually like having physical stuff in front of me stresses me out.

831
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,920
Do you do you like playing games with other people or do you mostly play solo games?

832
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,960
I'm I'm solo.

833
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,240
I don't like other people.

834
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,280
I'm having too much fun.

835
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:08,080
I don't but also especially 'cause the the games I enjoy most are either story games and I have like strong feelings about story and want to do it my way

836
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,560
Or they're spreadsheet optimizers and I hate to see a spreadsheet optimized incorrectly.

837
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,600
I've been watching my spouse replay Toothpoint Hospital and I had to leave the room because it was too upsetting.

838
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,680
I was like, you're doing it wrong.

839
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,319
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

840
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:31,319
But they're like, Oh, I love watching you play games because it's so funny.

841
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,060
And you could get good, you know.

842
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:42,780
It's No, I I I w I watch uh my husband play two point hospital and though this is why I manage the finances.

843
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,260
Fair enough.

844
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:55,440
There's um there's a there's a game I actually think there's a game called For the Queen where you basically just take cards with prompts on and discuss the answers to the prompts and the final

845
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,580
question that you answer is the queen is under attack, do you defend her?

846
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:06,780
And the questions are all designed to get you to build this build this around this queen who is the center of the story but is not

847
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:14,380
earn agent in the story and that kind of roleplay when you were talking about inducing hallucinations in your readers

848
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,820
I was thinking about shared hallucinations and and things like that.

849
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:25,180
The funny thing was until up until the COVID pandemic I was a a role-playing game uh denier

850
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:47,600
author of The Unspoken Name, which is my favorite sword and sorcery orc adventure, um, offered to DM over Discord, and this turned out to be the key.

851
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,120
Uh over Discord.

852
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:49,840
Uh

853
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:52,619
A Dungeons Dragons game for a group of friends.

854
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,980
It was so good.

855
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:55,099
It was so good.

856
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,380
I actually I love it.

857
00:55:56,539 --> 00:55:59,660
But also A

858
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,420
It was via a keyboard and that meant essentially what I was doing was writing dialogue.

859
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:06,380
And I love to write dialogue with friends, with somebody else doing all the difficult bits.

860
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:06,940
Brilliant.

861
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,220
I had a great time.

862
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:14,700
That makes me that yes, that makes me happy because I I was yes, I think you'd be very good at role-playing, so it makes me happy you've done some.

863
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,079
'cause I think that is otherwise it would be a loss to the some um knowledge of humanities.

864
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,520
I I like the shout out to role-playing game deniers of whom I am one.

865
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,520
I kind of did it when I was a child.

866
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,079
I did it until I was I left university and I

867
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,560
wasted a lot of time and got a terrible degree.

868
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,760
And then I was like, and I'm never gonna do that again and by and large I haven't.

869
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,760
I've occasionally done like a one shot or something but it it Yeah went away.

870
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,840
So but maybe I should try it on Discord.

871
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,360
Could do

872
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,860
Um we could we could do one as a bonus episode.

873
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:50,820
Um right, we should probably face No we could that would be but it would be on Discord, it wouldn't be a podcast, would it?

874
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:56,339
We could I don't know if you know this, but you know when we're on the Zoom for the podcast, Alison, and you know how we record it?

875
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:00,260
It turns out you can also do that with Discord.

876
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:04,460
Whoever just did the intake of breath.

877
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:06,460
No, but you were typing, you weren't doing audio, were you?

878
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:07,339
No, we weren't doing audio.

879
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,560
Discord can also be audio.

880
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,760
But okay, no, fair enough.

881
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:13,079
Interesting.

882
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,440
That means that means it could be published.

883
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:16,760
No.

884
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,000
Dangerous, dangerous.

885
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,560
Watch this space.

886
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:28,100
Okay, we should move on to picks because we are running we are to the end.

887
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,860
Um so Emily, have you brought a pick to discuss?

888
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:37,780
I am with apologies to the audience who've heard me do this once already, I am going to talk about one of the books

889
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:44,200
Um that I chose for Desert Island books because I reread them all in the run-up to the event and I was like, Oh these are so good.

890
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:46,280
Isn't it good when books are good?

891
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:47,240
It is.

892
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:57,619
The book I loved most in my reread was uh Kai Ashante Wilson's The Sorcerer of the Wild Eaps, which thank you.

893
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,400
2015 novella from Tor.

894
00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:00,039
com.

895
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,319
It was the first Tor.

896
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:07,160
com novella, and I think it was the reason the imprint existed was to find a way to publish this book.

897
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,240
And my God, what a book it is

898
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:16,860
It's short and it tells the story of a merchant caravan traveling through this jungle, the Wild Deeps.

899
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,540
It is set in a world which is something like

900
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,760
uh the aftermath of Roman North Africa.

901
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:30,320
Uh it is set in a world where there were gods and they have departed, but the demigods are still here.

902
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,920
It is a romance, a tragedy

903
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:42,700
It is a book that is deeply concerned with language and with not being able to speak and losing your language.

904
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:55,240
um or speaking in a language of s uh a a low prestige dialect, uh which Wilson, who is black American, has written elsewhere uh about how hard it was to get published because

905
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:07,520
a lot of fantasy editors wouldn't let him get away with using the vernacular of African American uh vernacular English in his own writing, which was literally about that

906
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:17,200
Um but it's such a good book, just an exquisite book, and Wilson is I think one of our great contemporary masters of speculative fiction.

907
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,400
He's just brilliant, just extraordinary author.

908
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:29,560
It's also really fun to read and really beautiful and there's some fantastic fight scenes that made me want to make my own fight scenes better and some incredible magic.

909
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,100
Um and I love it.

910
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,220
I love it to bits.

911
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,580
I want everyone in the world to read it every time, possibly several times.

912
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,300
It is on my big list of things to read now.

913
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,500
Um I have to read all of the books for Parker Ward first.

914
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,240
But then right after I've done that, it will be at the top.

915
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,119
Um but yes, no, it sounds absolutely amazing.

916
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,400
Have you read it, Alison?

917
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,079
I have not, but I'm going to.

918
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,720
I c I I I'm like, oh, oh no

919
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:56,100
Uh if given a choice between reading that and reading the Silmarillion again.

920
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,100
Oh and the other wonderful thing about it, it's a novella.

921
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:00,900
It's short.

922
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,820
You can read it in an evening and it's wonderful.

923
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,480
And there is a critical view of

924
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:24,960
Science fiction and fact of speculative fiction generally that argues that the novella is at the correct length for writing in this field.

925
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:25,600
And

926
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,820
And so yes, it was a shame when they all went away.

927
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,980
And I li I think novellas are a great a great It's my favourite length to write.

928
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,140
Uh if I could get away with it like

929
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,880
If they would pay me more money for them I would do nothing but novellas because I I think they're lovely and satisfying to write.

930
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:47,980
If i if the if my pick had been in villa I'd have finished it.

931
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,220
Um fair enough.

932
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,420
What is your pick of that?

933
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:57,099
So I arrived at the convention on Friday afternoon and realized I did not have a pick, which is a very normal thing for me for Octothorpe.

934
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:05,560
And a friend of mine says, Well this book is amazing and it is ninety nine P at the moment on your Kindles and your Kobos, so you should go and read that.

935
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:11,320
And John said, There is no way you will have read that by Sunday morning because you're at a convention.

936
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,440
So my pick is the first

937
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,960
41% of Ray Nailers where the axe is buried, which is just fantastic.

938
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:26,160
It is a a a near future, a very believable near future in which uh we uh we visit.

939
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,240
Three we're in three countries.

940
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:38,520
One of them is the future Russian Federation where the president is being kept alive by by being by having his personality downloaded in successive bodies.

941
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,200
The second is uh

942
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:50,920
is is is Britain and uh and other other countries similar countries where the population has voted for rationalization where instead of having a

943
01:01:50,859 --> 01:01:57,980
uh messy human governments we have AI prime ministers who make all the decisions and it turns out everything is better.

944
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,460
That is the least plausible thing in the book so far.

945
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:04,619
But yeah, yeah, I'm prepared to that's well within the things that you can accept as a

946
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,260
uh in your suspension of police belief.

947
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:12,580
And the third story is a place where um they have just introduced uh uh

948
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:19,779
a a Prime Minister of this kind and I don't know what's happening yet because I'm only forty one percent of the way through but oh my god, it's been amazing.

949
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:22,900
If I hadn't had to be here I'd have been finishing the book.

950
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:24,579
Yep, no fair.

951
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,700
I mean So read it.

952
01:02:25,779 --> 01:02:26,260
It's so good.

953
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:27,619
It's probably on your clerk list.

954
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:30,099
Uh yes, um it is um it is.

955
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:35,540
It is probably the next one on the big pile of books because um it has been jumping out to me.

956
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,940
I'm glad you've picked it before I read it.

957
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:41,260
Because I probably shouldn't talk about it in too much detail on the pod uh yet.

958
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,619
But um but yes, uh I'm looking forward to it.

959
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:46,539
John, you have two minutes apparently.

960
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:46,940
I'm sorry.

961
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:47,579
Okay

962
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:51,900
I'm gonna pick a book I read for the Clark Award uh in the last round.

963
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,380
I'm gonna pick The Life Impossible by Matt Haig.

964
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,740
Um so this is actually inspired by conversations I had um

965
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:02,299
while uh waiting for the queue to go down at uh Emily's book launch on Friday.

966
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,660
And I was wondering what I was going to pick.

967
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:09,740
I hadn't really decided, but this is one of the books I read for the for the Clark and thought was amazing and haven't picked yet.

968
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,900
This is a book about

969
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:17,460
A woman who goes to Ibetha and she has a good old time.

970
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:24,180
And everything about that sentence is misleading in the true style of John Coxon's summaries of books.

971
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:35,840
Um it's about a woman who has lost her partner later in life and goes to Ibitha and kind of rediscovers who she is and comes to terms with

972
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,100
things about that.

973
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:46,340
I found the main character incredibly compelling and and also very sympathetic and I I just very much enjoyed

974
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:51,940
the process of reading about her and her journey of self-forgiveness, which I thought was amazing.

975
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,260
But it's also a love letter to Ibetha

976
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,040
and um a screw you letter to billionaires.

977
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,640
Uh and so all three of those tenets of the book I thoroughly enjoyed.

978
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,480
Um and it made me cry in an airport bar in Washington DC.

979
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,359
So um, you know, highly recommend.

980
01:04:08,359 --> 01:04:09,640
Ten out of ten book.

981
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,480
So with three books again, that's not long.

982
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,200
Three books.

983
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:12,599
No.

984
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,440
Next time I'll pick a game, don't worry.

985
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,000
Um and then the time after that I will also pick a game.

986
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:18,839
I've got the next two games lined up.

987
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:24,600
And and um next time I'm going to pick the ashes you you've been um you've been warned.

988
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,920
So um let me go back to my notes really quickly so that we

989
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,819
Can have we've done everything we were gonna do.

990
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:36,900
So I would, before we wrap up, like to say a very big thank you to our stunt Liz Emily Tesh.

991
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,160
Where can people find you, Emily?

992
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,920
Right now they can find me at the bar.

993
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,280
Yes, excellent.

994
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,720
But in general you can find me on Blue Sky at Emily Tesh.

995
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,000
net, which is also the address of my website, Emily Tesh.

996
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:58,400
net.

997
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,280
Way.

998
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,480
Excellent.

999
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,520
And have you got a new novel or any projects coming up?

1000
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,920
Nothing official.

1001
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,599
Oh sorry, Esther.

1002
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,000
Okay.

1003
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,599
Nothing official, uh I can't tell you.

1004
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,319
Uh but I am writing a book which I would describe as undead transgender Patricholy's Minecraft.

1005
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:14,720
Brilliant.

1006
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,160
I will look forward to that.

1007
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,680
And that will be the episode title.

1008
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,400
Right, we have, I have forgotten it in my hotel room.

1009
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,160
We have a small token of our appreciation, which was provided by listener Tobes.

1010
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:31,900
Um so thank you very much listener Tobes and that the token of appreciation can be a surprise for later.

1011
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:33,220
But yes.

1012
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,540
Um I'd like to say thank you to Nolly for doing tech.

1013
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,460
Another round of applause for Nolly.

1014
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,860
And um I'd like to thank Esther for putting us on program and Novacon in general for not saying don't put them on program.

1015
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,740
And let us be in the big room that has the microphones.

1016
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,240
That's amazing.

1017
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,520
Thank you very much then.

1018
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,080
And then um it's good and that was

1019
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,460
Sorry, I've forgotten how to do it.

1020
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,060
It's only been 148 episodes.

1021
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,940
That was the Ultra Thought Podcast, and it's goodbye from me.

1022
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,060
It's goodbye from me.

1023
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,740
And it's goodbye from me.

1024
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,120
All right.

1025
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:34,580
