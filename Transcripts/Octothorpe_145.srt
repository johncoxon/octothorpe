1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,300
I'm a big fan of skulls.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:06,040
You can't be a fan of Warhammer 40,000 for too long without acquiring a fondness for skulls.

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:25,460
Hello everyone and welcome to the very 145th episode of Octothorpe,

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,620
which is finding out that it is the chosen one,

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,200
despite the fact that it's of a different ethnicity

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,460
to everyone else on the planet,

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,580
on the 9th of October 2025.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,280
I'm John Coxon.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm Alison Scott.

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,200
And I'm Tommy Ferguson.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,320
Hello, Tommy.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,380
Hello.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,140
Thank you very much for coming and being Liz for the day.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,480
It's my absolute joy.

15
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,080
I'm new to Octothorpe, but I'm playing catch-up really quickly.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,480
You'd never heard of us before we'd asked you to be on, huh?

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,000
My letter of comment elides that.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,720
Yes, indeed.

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,480
And we do have some letters of comment.

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,980
And let's start with a letter of comment from one Tommy Ferguson.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,720
So this wasn't planned because we asked you to be on after you sent this, but it's quite good.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,740
Talk about a segue.

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:16,540
Indeed.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:17,940
Thank you, John.

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,060
Yeah, the email was around Alan and David's note for Unconfined.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,580
It got me thinking again about Easter cons and their future.

27
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,040
And I should add, I'm on the committee for Unconfined,

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,560
so I might have a slight bias there.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,120
What I really like about what they're doing is their ambitions for outreach,

30
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,420
especially other parts of genre fandom and younger people.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,760
I saw this in evidence that we connect and we try to do

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,120
with relative levels of success,

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,560
but I think it was made a lot easier with our city centre location.

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,340
People knew where we were.

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,900
People had experience of being there before.

36
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,340
And it was accessible.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,980
and it's the same for Glasgow in 2027.

38
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,520
Though I'm not too sure I'd say about previous conventions

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,500
like the Metro Hotel, for example, or indeed Telford,

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,420
which were not as accessible to local people

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,660
and therefore made it a bit more difficult

42
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,280
to get people to come for the very first time.

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,120
Again, and you mentioned pricing as well,

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,960
another thing we touched on to try and do the outreach

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,240
made it as cheap as possible for people locally to come.

46
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,340
And in fact, we had a Â£5 Saturday rate

47
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,700
for cosplayers and so that's something i'm really enjoying about on confined and maybe something

48
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,840
you should think about for shoot you restocons no we had um i would say i was working yesterday was

49
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,940
saturday as we record listeners i was working an open day at northumbria which the university i

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,300
work at and they had the newcastle anime and gaming con and so campus was sort of half very

51
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,140
nervous 18 year olds with their parents and half people dressed up as anime characters and it was

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,840
quite the vibe but i really liked the cosplay presence at um reconnect in belfast i thought

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,320
that was really good and i think certainly exposed a lot of people who might not otherwise have come

54
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,720
to our brand of fandom so i thought that worked very well i think your point about telford being

55
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,820
great for eastcon people but not necessarily great for bringing people in is a good one too because

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,980
it was a good site but like you said there's not a lot of passing trade as it were yeah and i love

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,680
Telford, I thought it was a great convention.

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,940
I thought the hotel and the

59
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,020
convention centre combination was really

60
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,160
good, but it was very much

61
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,880
for an established audience,

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,060
people who normally go to Easter

63
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,140
Cones. And the same with the Metropole

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,080
in Birmingham. I've heard some comments already

65
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,960
about even though the hotel prices

66
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,220
are ridiculously cheap for a Hilton,

67
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,380
fantastically cheap,

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
it is still a stretch for people coming

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,140
for the first time or just wanting to

70
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,160
test their feet in the

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,520
water to see what this thing is about.

72
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,420
I think there's an anime

73
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,600
convention at the same time

74
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,480
as the Eastercon so it might be that there's

75
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,660
potential for some sort of

76
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,540
cheap membership for people who are going to be

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,680
at the anime con but I don't know if they're thinking about that

78
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,660
but that could be a way of

79
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,640
trying to achieve the same sort of thing

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,380
Yes, I mean I think it was wonderful

81
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,680
that this year's Eastercon

82
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,680
was at Belfast

83
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,780
was it this year's Eastercon? My brain is fried

84
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,640
It was

85
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,120
Feels like years ago

86
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:27,220
It does feel like years ago. Sorry. I think it's wonderful that this year's Eastercon was in Belfast because it's a capital city and it allowed, it meant it has some presence in the local area.

87
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,060
But fundamentally, the thing that's driving where we hold EasterCons is where we can hold EasterCons.

88
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:43,060
And so I think it's important that when you've got them in sites like Glasgow, where we can, we should be able to attract local attendance.

89
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,460
I mean, historically, of course, Glasgow got huge numbers of local attenders at WorldCons at EasterCons.

90
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,060
But this is a long time ago now.

91
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,240
And that wasn't the case the last time we held it there.

92
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,100
Yeah, we shall come back to that with a little bit of foreshadowing there.

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,540
It's been a long time since we've held an Eastercon in Glasgow because the previous one was 2014.

94
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,820
And that was quite small because, well, it was quite large as EasterCons went,

95
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,660
but it was probably smaller than you'd expect a Glasgow convention to be.

96
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,060
I think probably because of LungCon.

97
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,120
Anecdotally, I know lots of friends of mine didn't go to that EastCon

98
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,460
because they were going to WorldCon.

99
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,940
So I'm curious how unconfined numbers will look

100
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,080
and how many people they will get in from Glasgow.

101
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,540
I mean, especially because Glasgow 2024 did such a good job

102
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,140
of bringing Glaswegian fandom in.

103
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,820
I assume that will be a very different mix of people to the 2014 EastCon.

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,400
But yeah, we will see.

105
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,240
I am not clairvoyant, so I do not know.

106
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,980
but I've got my fingers crossed it'll work out.

107
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,880
I was also going to highlight something you said

108
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,640
in your lock, Toby,

109
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,900
which was that you were a big fan of the Dread movie.

110
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,280
I am indeed.

111
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,500
Unlike Liz or me.

112
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,320
Well, I'm of a certain age, I should say,

113
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,620
and 2008 was one of my growing up formative experiences

114
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,540
and I loved Judge Dredd as a comic

115
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,080
and I loved the concept.

116
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:16,540
And then when I heard they were remaking the movie, in effect, we talked briefly about the original Stallone Dread movie.

117
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,340
And when I heard, again, say the remake was happening, I thought, listen guys, don't fuck this up.

118
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,040
It's already had one go, which wasn't well received. Just make sure you don't mess it up again.

119
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,560
And I don't think they did. I think they got, to a certain extent, a lot of the spirit of Judge Dredd.

120
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,580
I think you guys talked about it last time,

121
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,480
where they didn't quite pick up on the satire

122
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,200
and the authoritative nature of the state.

123
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,780
And the idea behind the comic originally

124
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,860
was to show that up and satirise it.

125
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,500
And I think a lot of people now have seen the movie

126
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,900
as an action movie and view it that way

127
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,220
and don't see the kind of subtext.

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
But having said that, I really enjoyed the first one as well,

129
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,100
the Stallone movie.

130
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,280
And I know it's got a whole bunch of criticism,

131
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,480
but it takes a lot of different aspects of Dread.

132
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,680
It takes a bit of the comic humour.

133
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,280
It takes a bit of the look and style as well.

134
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,000
I really enjoyed.

135
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,700
And apart from Stallone's acting,

136
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,680
there's some really good other actors in it as well.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
Yeah, so Paul Weimer and Jonathan Baddeley

138
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,300
both wrote to say that they were surprised

139
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,060
we hadn't mentioned the Stallone movie.

140
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,600
And I freely confess I have not seen it.

141
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,540
And I mentioned this in the pre-recorded topic.

142
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,720
I was like, oh no, it's a lot of fun,

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,480
despite, you know, maybe not being the most

144
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,060
true to the comics adaptation it could have been.

145
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,800
I think it's possible that at least one of us should have watched that movie before we did our Dread episode.

146
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,280
I mean, I don't know because I don't want to.

147
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,560
But now Tommy told me it's good.

148
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,120
I might.

149
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,620
Or, well, no, Tommy told me it's fun.

150
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,440
I shouldn't put words in your mouth, Tommy.

151
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,900
I think Tommy may also have said that it's a generational thing.

152
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:58,920
And you might find that it doesn't necessarily speak to you in that way that old product sometimes doesn't speak to younger people.

153
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:12,980
The visuals are good. You'll enjoy the visuals. They're fun and entertaining. It's not a great movie. It's a good movie. I don't have the same kind of scale you guys have for waiting movies. My movie tastes at thresholds are quite low. I will enjoy most things.

154
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,000
I think John's movie's threshold tastes are quite low.

155
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:28,400
Rude. What I hadn't realised is that one of the people in the 1995 Judge Dredd movie is Ian Dury, and that does make me excited to watch it, because I am a big fan of Ian Dury.

156
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,180
Legend.

157
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,900
He's typecast in the movie.

158
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,960
You will see it as an Ian Jury part.

159
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:34,960
Brilliant.

160
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,820
I don't think Ian Jury was good at playing characters

161
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,080
other than Ian Jury, was he?

162
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,900
He was the Sean Connery of his day.

163
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,580
So yes, please watch it.

164
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,020
It's 90 minutes, even less perhaps.

165
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,600
It's not a huge ordeal.

166
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,640
And you will take some stuff away from it.

167
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,580
Hopefully smiles.

168
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,640
Yay!

169
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,600
I will take some stuff away, yeah.

170
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,040
Because what I took away from Dread 3D was, oh, I don't want to watch that again.

171
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,860
And you guys mentioned The Raid.

172
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,800
Alison, don't watch The Raid.

173
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,800
You will not enjoy it.

174
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,280
No, no.

175
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,340
In fact, both John and Liz told me not to watch The Raid because I would not enjoy it.

176
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,380
We do try and look after you.

177
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:22,240
So we also heard on Blue Sky from Brian Nisbet, who basically expressed condolences with Alison

178
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,980
for her going back down the Slay the Spire rabbit hole.

179
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,060
How's that going, Alison?

180
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,000
I've reached Ascension 16 with the silent.

181
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,360
I don't know what that means.

182
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,460
I have so little context for that sentence.

183
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,420
I understood all of the individual words.

184
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,640
No clue.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,360
I am confident that people in the audience will understand.

186
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,560
I've taken time off for other obsessions in the meantime.

187
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,140
Oh, well done.

188
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,059
And I was thinking about doing a predictive pick this week

189
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,520
where I talked about the fact that Blueprints is now out for the Mac

190
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,940
and Hades 2 has been released.

191
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,560
But that's clearly just follow up on previous things

192
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,860
that caused me to lose a week or two of my life.

193
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,280
Sorry, spend a week or two of my life

194
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,360
productively engaging with top-tier entertainment experiences.

195
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,820
I should say that that piece of information about Hades 2 being released

196
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
will go down very well in our heart at all.

197
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,500
There you go.

198
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,360
Not with my bank balance, but with the house.

199
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:33,100
yeah no well i spent 323 hours on hades one which i'm gonna say works out quite well as cost per

200
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,480
pound i should also add it's not me playing but it's my eldest daughter we also heard from chris

201
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,400
garcia chris like me is excited about the fact that joe walton is one of the guests of honor for

202
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,959
worldcon in 20 in montreal in 2027 and says she had the best quote about me ever patrick nielsen

203
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,380
Hayden says doesn't Chris have a big ego and Joe said have you ever met him he's all id

204
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,540
and he also says that John lied about having two dinners because it was actually two lunches

205
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,260
I'm not sure that that's a major difference it's a philosophical point for sure you know were they

206
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,339
at midday then are they actually dinners John is from the north you know Chris I'm from the east

207
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,300
you're from the north now aren't you you have your dinner right and then your tea

208
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:30,020
he does make a point about having known a lot of movie folks there are layers to get to them that

209
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,540
are there for pretty good reasons he knows the folks that directed captain marvel that is a

210
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,400
classic chris garcia name drop and if he wants to send them an email he's got to go through their pr

211
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,139
reps at about two out of three times it's a miss and so that i think goes back to what we were

212
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,000
talking about last time he did mention about the sound design and you guys talked about last uh last

213
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,440
time uh and he highlights that the best sound design he's heard is on the movie the abyss and

214
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,440
i have to absolutely agree with that um because watching that even with your eyes closed it is

215
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,880
terrifying and knowing what's going to happen can come come next uh the sound design just enhances

216
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,519
that so much to you for a bit of chris that's a really good show no the abyss is great i watched

217
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:19,100
it for the first time relatively recently and it is it is a it is a cracking movie extremely tense

218
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,240
like oh it's so stressful um but yeah i did enjoy it when they joined the rat my nerves get really

219
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,480
anxious uh that's just a creepy yeah i can't believe john you haven't watched that before

220
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:40,499
you are just ridiculously young it's scary well but also it wasn't easy to it wasn't easy to watch

221
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,140
like it's only just had a re-release on disc and before that you couldn't it wasn't on streaming

222
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:54,360
and it wasn't out we also heard from scott edelman on blue sky who wonders whether social media is

223
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,620
contributing to the death of conventions no yeah no i agree i don't think it is i think it's additive

224
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,439
not subtractive that's an experience yeah i don't use social media instead of hanging out with my

225
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,420
friends in person i use it as well as and anecdotally i think some people get into cons

226
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,480
because of social media so it might actually have the opposite i don't know how you find out

227
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,720
um i think it'd be very difficult to actually know for sure but my suspicion is that it doesn't

228
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:28,420
reduce con attendance if i think of um reconnected recent conventions um use of discord in association

229
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,439
with the convention itself has done nothing but enhance it increases access increases capability

230
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,260
it's just a massive addition as you say to uh to the con experience when and like because i did the

231
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,460
discord for the world con the glasgow world con and there were a lot of people i say a lot of

232
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:51,000
people like maybe even handfuls of people who came up to me and said that they'd found the discord

233
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,220
helpful as new attendees because it had like let them start getting to know people before actually

234
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,939
arriving on site and i do think that if you're very embedded in conventions already they're not

235
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,660
daunting but i think having ways that you can kind of get into the community in advance of arriving

236
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,040
in the room with a thousand people in it can be really useful i think that ties into that as well

237
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,380
like facebook twitter well blue sky now i guess um discord yeah i was going to say the average

238
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,760
national science fiction convention octocon um which is actually happening right now as its podcast

239
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:28,339
goes out um has a huge online presence before the convention they've won events they've got the

240
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,500
quizzes they've got a huge facebook presence and discord presence and they really actively

241
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,180
enhance their community and they still have a very strong masking policy so they're very aware

242
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,660
of their community needs and but their online social presence is part of the dimension and in

243
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:51,360
fact the sunday is online only so there is no in person and that that just makes the dimension

244
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:58,820
welcome for everybody yeah no exactly i think that's a uh a good a good point um and let me

245
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,320
so and actually you are so you are going to be on a panel at octagon tommy you mentioned in your lock

246
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:13,240
i did i'm on the very first panel hey coincidence or anything um 10 o'clock on a saturday morning

247
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,359
um which is you know quite nice reasonable times uh and the panels are about remakes and as i

248
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,760
mentioned earlier about Dread.

249
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,380
One of the key things I want to bring to

250
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,200
that panel is

251
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,260
every time you hear somebody's remaking or

252
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,380
making something, my first

253
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,200
thought is, please don't mess it up.

254
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,340
When I heard they're making the series

255
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,100
of The Expanse, I thought,

256
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,260
guys, this is my favourite book series

257
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,420
ever. Just don't fuck it

258
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,580
up. And did they?

259
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,360
They did not. They did a really good job

260
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,320
of it. I'm one of those

261
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,439
people who are massively evangelical

262
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,700
about The Expanse books and TV show.

263
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,360
And I kind of, I mean, I thought Battlestar Black,

264
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,380
because it was my favourite TV sci-fi show ever.

265
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,920
Nope, it's now The Expanse.

266
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,100
And the guys that developed that science fiction group

267
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,680
never tire of me talking about it.

268
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,020
That's fair.

269
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,960
So, obviously, I love The Expanse so much

270
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,800
that I'm savouring the television series

271
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,100
and only watching episodes very occasionally.

272
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,400
and in fact

273
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,780
Johnny Baddeley wrote

274
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,780
to express support

275
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,880
for my struggles

276
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,860
with The Expanse

277
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,700
and said

278
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,140
it's taken him eight months

279
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
to go through season two

280
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,760
so it's not just me

281
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,060
The show that is that

282
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,080
for me is For All Mankind

283
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,120
where I sort of

284
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,740
basically got so slow

285
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,300
at watching it

286
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,940
that I said to his partner

287
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,920
you could probably watch it

288
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,920
without me at this point

289
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,460
because yeah

290
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,400
we're watching like

291
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,720
one episode every six months

292
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,440
and that's probably not

293
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,819
probably not helpful

294
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,400
about what mankind it's one of those shows where people tell you you know it's a slow burner

295
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,340
you know it came at home give it a few episodes once you get into it you really like it and i

296
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,140
just hate that nonsense i mean show doesn't grab me it's terrible and then i'm a complete hypocrite

297
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,880
when they talk about the expanse because you do need to give it a few episodes to get there

298
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:13,259
yeah well it's season four we're still waiting for it to get better so you know i have to give up now

299
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,020
frankly it's clearly it's clearly very well made and it's good science fiction and and you'll see

300
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,560
we haven't given up right yeah yeah just that we're just like oh should we watch the expanse or

301
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,339
oh there's another series of slow horses maybe we should watch that instead you should slow slow

302
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,060
horses is great uh i am told i haven't seen it yet it's on my big list of things i want to watch

303
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,879
um it's not so not not genre though unless your genre is grimy things set in london which um

304
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:46,180
you know after randor i i quite like well and the other thing is like do you remember in the old days

305
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,100
when there wasn't enough science fiction tv that you couldn't you just had to like all of the

306
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:59,260
science fiction tv right yeah because there was like three of them and that was it i i may remember

307
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,859
the older days back before the dawn of time when in fact i did like doctor who and star trek i still

308
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,260
love star trek doctor who but star trek's great um right

309
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:26,100
we should do topics and we have some we well we do so um we have tommy here with us today

316
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,420

317
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,760
know about you tommy before we get into the before we get into the nitty-gritty alison has something

323
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,400
most of them are sitting there somewhere most of them are very old ones there's nothing recent

324
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,400
that I hasten to add. And is there anything else you think people should know other than that you're

325
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:06,460
a fanzine fan? I'm old, so I've been active in fandom. I counted it out 45 years now in various

326
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,000
different ways. And as you said, I seem to be a con runner again. That's kind of how I started off

327
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:20,240
from fanzines into con running. Yes, primarily in Belfast, as you say. I spent some time in

328
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:26,540
Toronto in the late 90s. People may remember me from there. But I got into fandom in the very early

329
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,440
1980s, the Irish Science Fiction Association, long gone but much remembered fondly. And then my very

330
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:40,840
first convention, property convention I should add, was at Glasgow at Albuquerque 3, the much-missed

331
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,220
Central Hotel. That was where I first kind of started my formal life in fandom, as it were.

332
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:58,100
I went to Toronto on my TAF trip by, I suspect I missed you by a few years, but I did enjoy meeting Toronto fandom.

333
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:05,360
So let's talk about Corflu. For those who don't know, do you want to explain Corflu to our listeners?

334
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,800
So Corflu is a small convention primarily run by and for fanzine fans.

335
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,580
I'm assuming everybody knows what a fanzine is.

336
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,500
Corfu's been going, it's 43 now, I think, this year.

337
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,960
It's been going forever.

338
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,500
It was the very first convention to have a hybrid element, a Bidou element.

339
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,440
And effectively, it's people who write, produce, edit fanzines,

340
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,640
who come together to discuss the same.

341
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,620
And it's actually a great, fun convention.

342
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,680
I think it's the only convention that didn't miss a year during the pandemic.

343
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,660
That's right. I was a core 350 guest at the College Station 2020.

344
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,440
In fact, that was my first core fleet, which kind of begs belief.

345
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:07,180
When we were finishing up on the Saturday or Sunday, March 2020, everything was getting shut down.

346
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,660
airlines are getting shut down

347
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,220
our fights were brought forward a day

348
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,180
so Rob Jackson and I

349
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,260
were flying back together

350
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,880
basically panicking

351
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,820
my wife was going mental

352
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,840
to Hallyden in Texas with its open doors

353
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,260
policies, no masking

354
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,460
everybody getting together

355
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,500
we will be free, get home now

356
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,120
so yeah

357
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,040
as Alison says

358
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,860
we've run continuously

359
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,520
for the last 43 years

360
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,519
yeah so the

361
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,500
The 38th core flu was in Bristol, which was in November 2021.

362
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,700
So there was a sort of long gap between the 2020 and 2021 installments,

363
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,100
but it kind of contained most of the lockdowns.

364
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,680
And fancyclopedia notes, this means that core flu might be the only annual convention

365
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,480
whose sequence remained unbroken.

366
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,620
So if anyone can think of any counterexamples, write in.

367
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,800
Sequence of physical conventions.

368
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,180
Because obviously people had online versions, which counters real cons.

369
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,960
Jury's out.

370
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,020
The one thing I was going to pick up on, something that Tommy said,

371
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,160
is the one thing I do think our listeners know about fanzines is that Octothorpe isn't one.

372
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,920
Look, right, we've got to let that go.

373
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,760
One day we have to move on.

374
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,420
It's becoming a distraction.

375
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,020
That's one.

376
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,380
Obviously can't be in the fan awards.

377
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,740
Yes.

378
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,540
So I think I first met you, Tommy, at the Corflou in Bristol, I think.

379
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,880
That makes sense.

380
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,140
It does.

381
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,180
And I thought, this is an up-and-coming sort of chap who's going to run a convention in Belfast.

382
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,260
So what made you want to bring Corflou to Belfast?

383
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,760
It's a long story, as these usually are.

384
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,620
A guy called Mark McCann, he was my co-editor on Goddard-Ambrung,

385
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,940
a fan he used to do back in the 90s in the Good Mate.

386
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:12,940
So he and the other co-editor, James McKee and my wingman, as they call him, Eugene Doherty, went to the Leeds Corfu back in 1998.

387
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:22,740
They came back with stories of drink, loose women, drugs, debauchery, and all around a good time.

388
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,180
And I thought, fantastic.

389
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,860
Mark Leather wrote this up in an article, which is published in the Corfu Crack Souvenir Book.

390
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,280
So you can read all about it yourself.

391
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,300
that should be online somewhere.

392
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,480
I thought, yeah, this sounds like right up my street.

393
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,620
I really want to get to one of these things.

394
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,660
And as I said, from 1998 to the next one

395
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,180
that I actually physically got to was Texas in 2020.

396
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,580
Life got in the way.

397
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,740
Things happened, et cetera.

398
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,020
And when I was there in Texas,

399
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,280
I said, I've got to do this.

400
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,720
These guys have paid for me to come out here.

401
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,720
I've got to pay it back somehow.

402
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,180
I said, right, listen,

403
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,320
I will do one of these core flus in Belfast.

404
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,840
and it was Pat Berzi who actually said to me at the bidding session

405
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:11,940
so when is it going to be, what's the story, tell us more details

406
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,380
and I fondly recall asking, well, when are you all free?

407
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,600
Famous last word.

408
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,000
I basically organised a convention around people's needs

409
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,000
so we couldn't do it the year I wanted to do it

410
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,980
which would be the anniversary of Irish fandom

411
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,020
so we did it the following year

412
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,059
and my reasoning for doing it was

413
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,660
these are all the people in fandom I really like

414
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,600
and respect and love to spend time

415
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,700
with in person. I want to

416
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,660
get them to my city and

417
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,720
basically organise a party and have

418
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,000
a good convention on the side.

419
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,640
It was just an excuse. And as I

420
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,580
said on the bit in session, this is quarterly

421
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,580
crack. Crack meaning to have a good

422
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,660
time in Irish, to have fun, to

423
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,560
get together, to socialise. And that's what I wanted

424
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,500
to do. I don't know what I really

425
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,500
think I could speed up, was to organise a quarterly

426
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,080
crack in Belfast.

427
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,340
And yeah, it happened.

428
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,400
It was fun.

429
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,400
I really enjoyed it.

430
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,460
I'm going to apologise again, as I always do when I talk about corporate crack.

431
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,940
I had some really good organising meetings with the hotel.

432
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,800
We talked with the head chef and the manager.

433
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,940
I had a fantastic vision for what the Sunday lunch was going to be.

434
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,740
Again, the reality on the day was somewhat suboptimal.

435
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,140
Again, that's the only flaw I thought in the whole corporate experience for me.

436
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,580
I think that's what we enjoyed.

437
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,840
But that meal was just terrible.

438
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,920
Again, I'm sorry, people.

439
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:38,880
It's not even in the top 10 of worst hotel meals I've had.

440
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,700
Worst convention banquets I've had.

441
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,340
And also, I think it goes to something we've been discussing for a while,

442
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,580
which is it's surprising how often the food that is available at a convention

443
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,760
is completely out of the control of anyone involved in the convention.

444
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,500
And that is distressing, but unfortunately true.

445
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,080
Yeah, there's always reasons for that.

446
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,180
The anniversary of fandom is 2022, I assume.

447
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:03,940
Yes.

448
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,100
If I've done the maths right.

449
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,020
So, and is that fandom like on the island,

450
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,260
Ireland of Ireland,

451
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,780
or is that Northern Irish fandom specifically?

452
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,880
So there's a thing called Irish Fandom Day.

453
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,780
You can look it up.

454
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,560
I guess it's 1947.

455
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,360
So Irish Fandom Day is the day

456
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,260
when James White first met Walt Willis

457
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,180
in a bookshop in Belfast.

458
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,440
I think it was on Wednesday.

459
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:34,160
And I think it was 75 years from then that I had originally planned to host the quarterly crack.

460
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,860
But as I said, people couldn't make it.

461
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,420
There was other events planned.

462
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,760
I'm not precious about this nonsense.

463
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,120
So I did it the next year.

464
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,240
Surely, John, I mean, we did have a cover from Hyphen last week.

465
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,440
Anyway, I don't know.

466
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,640
I have not heard of Irish Fandom Day.

467
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:03,360
For some reason, Ogsthorpe cover reading inside coverage did not convey this information to me, Alison.

468
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,500
I don't know why.

469
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,680
No, I just assumed you already knew about Irish fandom.

470
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,440
I'm sure I've mentioned lots of Irish fandom things before.

471
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,800
Okay, right.

472
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,520
But there is a difference between knowing about Irish fandom and knowing about Irish fandom day.

473
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:27,320
In much the same way that, like, I don't know when bottles were invented, but I have a bottle on my desk right now.

474
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,680
Roman times? Gotta go with Roman times.

475
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,400
So, yes, I'm familiar with Irish fandom. I've even been to some of the conventions.

476
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:43,300
I want to offer something in my defence, which is I opened the issue of Prolapse,

477
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,960
and Pete Weston also didn't know about Irish Fandom Day when James Bacon emailed the article for Prolapse.

478
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:56,560
And I feel like if my Spanish history is only up to the standard of Pete Weston, then I'm not doing too badly.

479
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,980
You're fine. You're fine.

480
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,900
But yes, there's a good article in that about it if listeners want to go read.

481
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,120
I'd say you were one of today's 10,000, but I think you might be one of today's one.

482
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm going to guess that there's at least one listener to this who has also learned something.

483
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,520
Maybe all of them.

484
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,340
Maybe. But I have learned things.

485
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:26,300
and so how do you think other than the meal like what did you did you enjoy doing core flu crack

486
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,680
like and did you think it went well i really enjoyed doing it um as i said i think at the end

487
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:38,580
um i did again tomorrow frankly um it's just it was just a lot of fun um i did you know a bit of

488
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,540
humblebrag mostly organizing myself um hey it's not very hard to organize to be honest you know

489
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,360
people come together and things are fairly

490
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:47,900
fluid.

491
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,480
Things that really happened to me

492
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,180
at the party was whiskey tasting,

493
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,580
a bit of a feature at Corfu,

494
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,720
gets people in the mood, shall we say,

495
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,520
and then Spike does her wine

496
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,640
tasting the next night, and

497
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,140
again, gets people in the mood.

498
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,600
Objectively, it went really

499
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,280
well. We had large attendance.

500
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,200
We dragged people out of the woodwork

501
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,180
who wouldn't normally come. Linda Grecke,

502
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,260
fantastic, wonderful to see her.

503
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,220
Joseph Nicholas came across, again, he hasn't been to many conventions recently.

504
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,620
A whole host of people turned up who people just did not expect to see.

505
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,140
And yet, it was, objectively people have said it was a fantastic time.

506
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,360
I really enjoyed doing it.

507
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,700
The hotel was great.

508
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,020
I chose hotel specifically because that's where I had my wedding reception many, many years ago.

509
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,660
On the same floor, bar, restaurant, hotel, convention space, all the same area.

510
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,680
And a nice part of Belfast, South Belfast,

511
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,600
people who know Belfast will know that BT9 is the kind of respectable part

512
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,320
just beside the university,

513
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,180
but far enough away from the students to make it okay.

514
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,020
Fair enough.

515
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,700
I genuinely enjoyed going on it.

516
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,440
People think I genuinely enjoyed attending, had a good time.

517
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,140
And yeah, again, I'd do it at the top of that.

518
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,040
Good stuff.

519
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,260
Did you go to Corflucrac, Alison?

520
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,200
Oh, yes.

521
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,280
Tell us about your experiences at Corflucrac.

522
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,800
Well, it was my second time in Belfast because I've been to TitanCon after Dublin 2019.

523
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:29,180
But my memories of that are rather inchoate due to being exhausted, really, really exhausted.

524
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,600
So Corflucrac was absolutely lovely because it was a good-sized convention.

525
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,500
It was neither too small nor too large.

526
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,500
It had a reasonable number of US travellers.

527
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:47,380
had a good number of uk fans including fans who are you know young some is z younger than you john

528
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,780
i think not actually i think z is not younger than you i was gonna say younger than john

529
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:59,980
maybe we're we're about the same age i would have said yeah similar age yeah and um

530
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:06,859
tommy had planned a whole pile of ice breaking exercises and we wandered into the hotel i guess

531
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,000
before the con officially started to discover everyone was just chatting to everybody else

532
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,720
in a kind of ice breaking not obviously required here way and there were people who'd not been to

533
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,580
Corflou before but but just you know it's a small enough convention that you can just chat to

534
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:28,180
everybody I I think the hotel food had a lot of food that did not contain vegetables and in general

535
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,679
our experience of Belfast cuisine was that week was that we kept finding we kept being offered food

536
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,980
that didn't have vegetables in it and we had to work quite hard to get food that had vegetables

537
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,300
in it and I you need to know I'm not a very vegetable forward person normally I have no

538
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:48,260
trouble going for a few days without with minimal vegetables but but a lot of it was deep fried as

539
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,300
well it was kind of the hotel was kind of like we have we have a bunch of tapas bites and they were

540
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,759
like deep fried things um but apart from that um Belfast was lovely the weather was lovely I think

541
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:05,620
are mostly lovely the beer was lovely the people were lovely the convention was you know core flu

542
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,660
has quite a small program but a carefully formed one um and it was all very good and i had an

543
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,840
absolutely brilliant time and it was the week before the easter con so it just left me slightly

544
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:21,320
tired for easter con but fortunately not sick um because there was a whole thing about the

545
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,739
transmission of viruses going on so and i think somebody at core flu somebody at core flu had

546
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:37,040
covid joe scolari unfortunately the night before oh that's sad but was very good at um insulating

547
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:47,080
he was fantastic yeah i i was sad that i didn't get to go i did not go to uh i i blah i'd been

548
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,519
to belfast once on a sort of i went to armar for a summer school so i kind of went through belfast

549
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,160
but it wasn't until Reconnect that I got to visit properly,

550
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,620
which is a lovely segue into Reconnect.

551
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:11,860
So how soon after running a core flu did you decide that you wanted to run an Eastcon, Tommy?

552
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,060
Was that something that you'd already decided at the point the core flu was happening,

553
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:16,340
or was it soon after?

554
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,740
It was well before.

555
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,659
It was 1986, actually.

556
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,500
LAUGHTER

557
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,800
Well, yeah, so quite a long way before.

558
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,300
Fair enough.

559
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:26,020
Yeah.

560
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,139
And it's Ian Sorensen's fault,

561
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,480
what most things are.

562
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,120
Hey!

563
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,040
Yep.

564
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,040
I think I mentioned at the opening ceremony

565
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,240
to reconnect the story.

566
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,020
So as I said,

567
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,419
my first convention was Glasgow Albecon 3.

568
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,120
I had a fantastic time.

569
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,500
And on a Sunday morning,

570
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,919
slightly hungover, I have to say,

571
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,639
I went to the future conventions type panel,

572
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
kind of hostings almost.

573
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,120
And I thought,

574
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,760
I don't know what this convention nonsense is, but I want more of it.

575
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:54,780
Tell me more.

576
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:56,940
So I signed up to Ian.

577
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,000
He was obviously getting ready to host the panel.

578
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,240
And I said, listen, this is something he's never going to let me forget, ever.

579
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,200
I said, is it OK if I run one of these things next year in Belfast?

580
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,000
I said, oh, asking Ian Soren for permission to run a convention.

581
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,720
Oh, yeah.

582
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,060
So I haven't let that down.

583
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,220
So he said at the end of the panel, Tommy Ferguson,

584
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,900
he was going to run a convention in Belfast.

585
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,640
Tommy, stand up.

586
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,920
and I went, yes, it's going to happen.

587
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,780
It's going to be this year.

588
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,300
It'll be in Belfast.

589
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,160
It'll be the Students' Union.

590
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,960
And I was just making it up as I met along.

591
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,320
Enthusiasm is half the battle.

592
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,060
But there were conventions in the Students' Union in Belfast, weren't there?

593
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,000
Mecons?

594
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,300
Nikons, which is before Mecons.

595
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,480
So Nikon 86, the very first Northern Ireland Science Space Convention,

596
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,300
happened six months after Albicon 3.

597
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,600
So yes, the enthusiasm took hold of me

598
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,160
and I grabbed Eugene Doherty

599
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,400
and between us, we organized the first convention.

600
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,860
There were four Nikons.

601
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:57,140
Nikon 1989 was the Unicorns.

602
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,560
Terry Pratchett was our guest of honor.

603
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,860
There was a bit of a hiatus then because we all graduated and we don't.

604
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,840
But you're right, Alison, there was another sequence of conventions

605
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,980
called MeCon, M-E-C-O-N.

606
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,520
And that went for 10 years and had some stunning guests.

607
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,680
It was a really fantastic sequence of conventions,

608
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,340
which I was only tangentially involved in, to be honest.

609
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,320
And then after that, a bit of a hiatus and time cons came along, building on the game of films kind of stuff.

610
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:30,040
So yes, my very first desire to run an Easter con happened at Albuquerque 1986.

611
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,600
It didn't actually come to life because, well, life as well.

612
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,240
There just isn't a facility, or it just wasn't a facility in Belfast to run anything like a 1,000-person convention

613
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,340
until about 5 or 10 years ago when the International Convention Centre opened adjacent to the hotel.

614
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,800
and once that happened I started to think a bit more about it

615
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,560
and then about five years ago

616
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,720
I heard of a scheme for the local tourist board

617
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,540
that would actually pay you money

618
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,380
to bring people into Northern Ireland

619
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,800
for conferences etc

620
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,000
quite a lot of money as it turned out

621
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,640
and that made the whole thing really financially feasible

622
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,600
and that's when James Bacon got involved

623
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,440
local fans got involved

624
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,160
can we actually do this?

625
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,420
James went we are doing this

626
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:22,000
not can we it's very much a yoda sense there's no try let's do um yeah and we could go off planning

627
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:28,240
um started organizing stuff together and lo and behold as you say i was in camp we were 26 months

628
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:35,600
ago it actually happened lovely stuff how do you spell nikon n-i-c-o-n n-i-c-o-n they've got

629
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:42,200
fancy they have fancyclopedia pages for both mecon and nikon i found mecon but i was having trouble

630
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,340
with Nikon. No, it was an ironing convention.

631
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,380
And then

632
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,980
the Unicom was called Unicon,

633
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,720
which is a good...

634
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,400
And it looks like both

635
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,280
Nikon and

636
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,360
Mekon ran

637
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,440
until they ran the Unicom

638
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,040
and then never run another one, which

639
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,340
I think is a bit

640
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,140
sad. We went to Unicom in

641
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,620
Winchester, which was the one before,

642
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,360
to bid for the one.

643
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,180
And our slogan was very

644
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,960
carefully crafted it was nikon all we need is you

645
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:29,680
thank you for the groans brilliant no further uh comment at this time you were selected as the east

646
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:36,480
con at uh birmingham in 2023 is that right am i remembering that right that's correct yes

647
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,400
Yeah, James and I got up and the fun con was our alternative bid.

648
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:50,240
And once we saw that happening, a slight bit of nervousness because it was a very well done bid.

649
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,680
Everything's lit my face, I think that was called.

650
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,820
But yeah, we got up, we had a stage, we had a plan.

651
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,500
Most people on the podcast will know of or heard of James Bacon and his enthusiasms.

652
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,640
I was

653
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,920
I was

654
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,380
I was the laurel to his hearty

655
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,540
keeping things sensible

656
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,140
treasurer etc

657
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,500
making sure the money was there

658
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,000
and that was a nice kind of

659
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,520
co-chairs we kind of played off

660
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,500
each other he says let's do this let's do

661
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,100
this stuff and I went no we can't afford to

662
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,060
yeah we can't let this go go go

663
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,580
no no

664
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,660
and we had those conversations with

665
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,100
Keith Smith and you may all recall

666
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,580
we had no plans

667
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,660
or very little plans to be online streaming or anything like that.

668
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,840
Again, complete vendor cost.

669
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,180
And JT was our tech person initially,

670
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,820
and he said, what do you need to do is do something very small

671
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,360
and then build on it.

672
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,020
And as the memberships grew and grew, due to our very low price,

673
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,400
we got the funds available to enable us to do streaming.

674
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,240
And at the end, we decided, God, February of this year,

675
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
that in fact we could stream five rooms, the main hall,

676
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,180
those four other rooms.

677
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,700
And I'm happy to say, by the time this podcast goes out,

678
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,660
those replays will all be available.

679
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,140
Those replays will be available for 12 months

680
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,600
at replay.hdeconbelfast.org.

681
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,520
Interesting. Okay.

682
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,280
It'd be great, actually, to watch some of the events,

683
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,660
the convention I co-chaired.

684
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,980
I didn't get to see many.

685
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,420
No, yeah, exactly.

686
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,740
I think it's really good that you can do that, right?

687
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,660
Like if you miss something or if there's a clash, you have that security blanket of I can catch it on catch up.

688
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,260
And you feel like you're you don't feel as much like you're missing out.

689
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,240
At least I don't.

690
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:51,780
As well as being able to kind of include people who can't get to the convention in person, which is another big boon.

691
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:57,040
You can hear our live show from East Con Belfast in episode 133, listeners.

692
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:04,360
It was episode 136 where we did our reflections on East Con Belfast and Reconnect.

693
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,340
And the only thing on the show notes, apart from the link to East Con Belfast in that episode,

694
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,540
is the fact that Rattlebag has won a major award for Best Cocktail Bar,

695
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,700
which tells you something about our East Con experience, which involved a certain amount of cocktails.

696
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,500
But we did also enjoy the convention very much.

697
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,340
So I guess the question is, did you enjoy it and would you do it again?

698
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,580
Yes and yes.

699
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,960
I would do it in a heartbeat.

700
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,320
A bit like Corfee Crack.

701
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,420
I had such a fun time organising it.

702
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,440
The committee we had were all very positive.

703
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,260
There was no egos.

704
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,100
Everybody was trying to do their best.

705
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,820
When we made mistakes, we stood our hands up and said,

706
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,060
sorry, we messed up there.

707
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,940
Let's do it better next time.

708
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,620
The convention itself, I thought objectively,

709
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,460
all the feedback I got, people had a great time.

710
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,280
There were some challenges with access between the two sites,

711
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,520
but that was always going to be an issue we knew about.

712
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,300
But yeah, every time I walked around,

713
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,740
and I did a lot of walking around,

714
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,100
I was like 50,000 steps in one day.

715
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,120
People just come up and said,

716
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,540
what a great time they were having.

717
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,300
And that just made my heart sing.

718
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,360
The fact that we've been able to do this,

719
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,300
put this on in Belfast,

720
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,220
the very first time,

721
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,880
we had 140 people who'd never been to New York City,

722
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,820
we had a whole host of people from Belfast

723
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,960
who'd never even enjoyed any kind of art.

724
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:32,140
our form of fandom and conventions and and we made a surplus so we can do it again next year

725
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,260
not an Easter cone but another convention yes this is a great segue so you are running

726
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,080
a convention do you want to do you want to tell us more about that well you dropped it in at the

727
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:47,020
start of the event at the introduction um but yes um because we had such a great time we got some

728
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:53,960
really good local engagement and from our community the various genres we have a convention next may

729
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,180
8th and 9th of May, back in the Hill, the same hotel, using the exact same spaces.

730
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,760
We have Anna Smith-Spark and Adrian Tchaikovsky as our guests of honour.

731
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,220
And we're really looking forward to getting everything together.

732
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:14,700
It'll be a small convention, 150, 200 people maybe, something like a Nobicon in size.

733
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,760
And we're really aiming, to be honest, to get that local community involved,

734
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,280
both north of the border as well as the Republic.

735
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,520
and I'll be at OctaCon,

736
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,160
the National Art of Science Fixing Convention,

737
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,840
this weekend, pushing this left, right, and centre.

738
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,500
And you can find out more on our website,

739
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,860
norncon, N-O-R-N-Con.org,

740
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,000
which should be live at the time this goes out.

741
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,900
So I was trying to find the website

742
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,220
to put in the show notes,

743
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,420
and I happened upon a YouTube video

744
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,160
which explains the joke of your fanzine title,

745
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,760
because it's the Norn scene from Wagner's Gotterdammerung.

746
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,320
And now I understand why your fanzine was called Gotterdammerung.

747
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,100
And I was like, oh, that's very good.

748
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,100
I like that very much.

749
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,460
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes, listeners,

750
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,340
if you want some Wagner.

751
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,280
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee.

752
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:08,880
Enough of that.

753
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,040
I wanted to just pick up on something you said

754
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,980
about using the exact same spaces.

755
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,280
Presumably you're just going to use the Hilton

756
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,080
rather than the conference centre as well.

757
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,880
Yes, just the same spaces in the Hilton.

758
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,460
The Hilton spaces, because, yeah,

759
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:29,720
There's plenty of room there for a kind of, you know, what Geese used to refer to as the mythical 200 person fantasy convention in Brighton.

760
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:37,900
The kind of small convention that you run because you want to, rather than the one that's part of a chain of long running events.

761
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,560
Yes. So one of the things that we probably might have talked about otherwise this weekend is that we understand that Pictcon,

762
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:50,460
Pictcon, which is the same weekend as Novicon, unfortunately, which is far as attempt to launch

763
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:57,100
a new convention in Perth is going very well and has sold 100 tickets, something like enough.

764
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:02,280
Anyway, that's the point is that once you, once you, when you do these things, if you,

765
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,720
if you build it, they will come. So I'm assuming that if you build Noncon, it will be an enormous

766
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,560
success. And is it, does, does the Belfast Council help you with that as well? Or are they like,

767
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,560
oh no, that's just a small local convention, we don't care.

768
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,340
They would help us, absolutely.

769
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,040
The challenge being that we need to bring people out of state,

770
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,880
so that's out of Northern Ireland,

771
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,260
before they will financially help us.

772
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,160
They're going to help us with advertising support

773
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,320
and getting the local media involved as well.

774
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,120
But in terms of money, cold, hard cash,

775
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,620
we need to get people from mainland UK or the Republic of Ireland

776
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,640
to come to Belfast and have hope to get out of stays

777
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:42,500
before any kind of subvention will kick in.

778
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,600
Having said that, the guys have been fantastic.

779
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,920
We had a lot of radio exposure.

780
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,340
We had media exposure.

781
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,880
They put us on their website, which a lot of the touristships view and see.

782
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,680
So, yeah, there's lots of good support there.

783
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,360
That's good.

784
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,940
I'm glad that you're getting that support.

785
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,380
And I think that's brilliant.

786
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,580
And I'm very excited to see more conventions kind of in the UK.

787
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,560
I think that's great.

788
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,940
and especially in Northern Ireland, which is, I mean, I want to go back to Belfast.

789
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,140
I had a very good time, so maybe not next year, but at some point, for sure.

790
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,700
Yeah, very conscious. This is quickly following Eastercon,

791
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,640
but it's quite deliberate because there's a few other genre events happening throughout Northern Ireland next year,

792
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,200
and we've chosen a time specifically to make sure that we can get some local people coming along.

793
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,960
And indeed, it's great to see, as you say, I mean, regional conventions like PitCon, BristolCon.

794
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,520
indeed Norncon here in Belfast are now starting to pick up and become become more sustainable

795
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:53,240
yeah yeah so you said um previously that you're working for Unconfined which is the 2027

796
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,600
Eastcon in Glasgow um so what are you going to be doing for them well I should point out first of

797
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,080
all that um I want to pay back all the support and help that we got for Reconnect this year

798
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,660
by helping out future conventions in whatever capacity um I'm not working next year on 2026

799
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:09,660
because I'm non-con.

800
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,040
Again, I will help out in person at the convention,

801
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,660
but I don't want to get too involved.

802
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,480
But then I'm free the following year.

803
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,660
So I've stepped up for the communications role for Unconfined.

804
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,040
So all the newsletters you see coming out will be by my fair hand.

805
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,720
And then closer to the convention,

806
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:31,120
I'm sure there'll be some at-con roles I'll be picking up as well.

807
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,080
Genuinely excited, as I say, because of the nature of the outreach.

808
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,940
And in our committee meetings, we've had some friendly rivalry.

809
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:46,520
Alan, co-chair with David, is very keen to beat our 999 attendance number.

810
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,980
Still annoys me.

811
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,200
Really still annoys me.

812
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,560
No, that's fair.

813
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,580
I can imagine why.

814
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,680
And so how long have you been working on Unconfined?

815
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,800
Have you been on the team the whole time or is that recent?

816
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,100
No, that's fairly recent.

817
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,720
for the last few months and I probably should be remiss as well if I didn't mention the Dublin

818
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:17,340
2029 committee bid which I'm also helping out on and a non-specific role just basically pushing it

819
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:25,720
as I'm doing right now it's a great bid and I urge you all to support it yes yes Dublin 2029

820
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:33,560
will be great yeah I got I got joined to the staff discord for 2029 by mistake and I was like

821
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,840
I don't think I've volunteered yet.

822
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,780
And they were like, I bet you'll do something there.

823
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,040
Yeah, I will, I will.

824
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,040
Yeah, no, very, very supportive of Dublin 2029.

825
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,200
I'm very much looking forward to going back to work on in Dublin

826
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,120
because I did have a fantastic time the last time.

827
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,900
And I guess that begs the question,

828
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,600
will there ever be a Belfast Worldcon bid?

829
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,880
Yes, when are you free?

830
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,980
I think I've got a space in 2039.

831
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,600
I'd love to be a Belfast Worldcon, genuinely would.

832
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,300
But the challenge is we don't have the facilities, unfortunately.

833
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,740
Even for a 4,000, 5,000 convention, we just wouldn't have facilities for it.

834
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,860
Yeah, until they build something like that, unfortunately it's off the cards.

835
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,300
But yeah, a drop of a hat, I'd be there.

836
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,760
That's fair, that is fair.

837
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:34,880
Tommy, is there a Belfast food specialty that we should have looked out for and made sure that we ate and should make sure that we eat at NogCon?

838
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:44,320
I'm sure I put it in the Facebook trailers, but there's a thing called a Paddy Pizza, which is effectively a base of Irish soda bread, pizza stuff on top.

839
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,100
Is that Paddy or Patty?

840
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:53,680
Paddy, P-A-D-D-Y. It's a speciality of a bar in Belfast, but then it's kind of spread out.

841
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:59,860
that sounds amazing okay i'm going back to melfast i'll send you a bit i'll send a link to that

842
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,980
yeah yeah thank you very much brilliant oh oh i've just seen a picture oh my god

843
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,340
that looks it looks amazing right it does look like the sort of food i like

844
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:20,900
so vibrant food culture food yes we went to the a the initially started uh restaurant for our

845
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:26,960
anniversary last week and um the fact that we have a mission start restaurant in belfast is a plus

846
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:32,420
um but then the rest of the scene just builds off that and yeah no it's a fantastic food culture

847
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:38,620
here from the the lowly paddy pizza to the the high-end hood casino yeah no i loved the food

848
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:44,340
uh in belfast um i did not have a bad meal while i was there it was great and you're so what

849
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:49,020
conventions are you going to like you i know you're going to novacon because i sold you a membership

850
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,380

851
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,980
I'm not unfortunately

852
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,760
I really would have loved to have gone

853
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,560
but family commitments mean

854
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,680
unfortunately I can't

855
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,880
I'll be at NovaCon, I'll be at Octocon

856
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,400

and of course EasyCon next year

858
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:07,900
Wey!

Alison and I will also be at NovaCon

860
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,440
and we're doing a live Octothorpe

861
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,180
so we'll see you there

862
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,380
and we'll also see you in the bar

863
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,640
we're not just going to blank you until the live episode

864
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:22,380
we're not we're not quite at that level yet um but yeah i mean you'll need to talk to our people

865
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:38,540
shall we do picks tommy do you have a pick so my pick is a book um it is and i'm not too sure

866
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:44,120
it's been picked before but it's from this year from the spring uh it's sleeper beach by nick

867
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,360
Harkaway, which

868
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,960
neatly ties into

869
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,380
the Soul Horses we talked about earlier, because

870
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,240
Nick Harkaway recently interviewed

871
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,000
the author of Soul Horses,

872
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,180
McCarran, and that's a fantastic interview

873
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:56,960
if you can see it.

874
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,140
It's basically a detective noir

875
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,220
thriller with science fiction

876
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,140
elements, a whole bunch of set of

877
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,540
big films, set in the near future.

878
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,280
It's the second book, the first

879
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,080
book was Titanium Noir,

880
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,080
this one's called Super Beach.

881
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,940
It reminds me a lot of Francis Buford's Chukoka Jazz.

882
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,500
Don't know how I pronounce that properly.

883
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,480
Cahokia, I think. Cahokia Jazz.

884
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,060
Oh, geez, I've mangled that.

885
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,220
Very hard-boiled detective, old Raymond Chandler,

886
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,380
with definite sci-fi twists.

887
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:34,940
It's got the baddies of our succession and murder-type empires.

888
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:40,120
It's very complex and very funny as well, very sarcastic.

889
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:45,400
complex clones pop twists and if you like any of that kind of stuff i've talked about

890
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,980
you will love this book so i know because nick harkaway is john le carrie's son correct um so

891
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:58,900
obviously john le carrie is is um i have it on my bookshelf downstairs and i have not yet read it but

892
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,140
it is very much on my radar and i am excited to read it just as soon as i've read all the other

893
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,700
books um but yeah uh um so i had not realized there was another one in the series but i am

894
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:15,320
intrigued. Yeah, once you read Titanium Noir, just send me a WhatsApp to say thank you. That's fine.

895
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,700
All right, I will do that. I will do that. So somebody, I think Liz must have picked

896
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:26,000
the Titanium Noir then because I think we've had it as a pick and I definitely haven't read it.

897
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:32,780
So, but clearly Nick Huckaway is someone who's on my radar, but haven't read yet.

898
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,800
So, and I'm currently in a Slow Horses thing. So, you know, I've got all of those to read.

899
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,700
I'm dithering about whether I should read the book first

900
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,600
or watch the show first

901
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,300
but I'm leaning towards watching the show

902
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,280
and then reading that book

903
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,040
and then trying to understand what's going on

904
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,920
You're flighty the books

905
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,160
the books are unperdominable

906
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,500
in quotes

907
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,740
So Liz picked Titanium Noir

908
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,700
in episode 97 listeners

909
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,580
so if you want to go back and listen to that you can

910
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,040
although there's no requirement

911
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:12,580
how would we even implement a requirement guys um well some people do think that they need to start

912
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,840
at the beginning and i just i think it's important we keep telling them that it's not

913
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,740
that it's entirely up to them very much a fan of listener rights

914
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:28,660
uh allison do you want to go next yes so i had a slight issue with finding a topic a genre pick

915
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:35,600
this time so I am picking the podcast Strong Message Here by Helen Lewis and Armando Iannucci

916
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,420
which is a Radio 4 podcast it's been going for over a little over a year and they're fairly

917
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:46,840
snappy they're about 25 minutes they talk about political language and the way it is used and

918
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:52,580
abused and it is both very informative so it does get you thinking about the words that

919
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,660
politicians and other public figures use all of the time which do not mean what they

920
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:06,680
pretend they mean and the ways in which that influences discourse. And it is also very funny

921
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:11,180
because these are two very funny people. And I'm sure because it's a Radio 4 podcast,

922
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:16,360
there must be some scripting going on, but it feels very conversational. So it feels like they

923
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,620
go down the sort of conversational rabbit holes that I like in podcasts and often don't find as

924
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,540
much of as I would like in Radio 4 podcasts. But this one is great. It's topical, but nevertheless,

925
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,380
I'm listening to it all the way from the beginning. So they talk about politics,

926
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,820
political language that's been in the news this week, but they also, but they're also talking

927
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,480
about the subject more generally. Absolutely love it. There's been a year of it. So there's quite a

928
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,520
lot of episodes for me to go through. And the reason I've been listening to it is that I have

929
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:56,640
been making a very large knockoff Lego micro blocks model that I bought in a charity shop.

930
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,680
so that gave me lots of time to listen to podcasts

931
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,460
over the last few days.

932
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,620
I will take that and put that on my list

933
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,180
because as I mentioned I listen to podcasts

934
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,020
when I'm running and that sounds perfect.

935
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,400
Yeah, no, it sounds awesome.

936
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,920
It's a really good podcast.

937
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,120
Not science fictional at all as far as I know.

938
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,300
They mention science fiction occasionally

939
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,500
because science fiction also has quite a lot of invented language.

940
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:16,540
Oh yes.

941
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,540
And politicians take some of their words

942
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,600
from science fiction as well.

943
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,200
Yeah.

944
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,840
And often not in a good way.

945
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,780
But it's not a genre podcast.

946
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,280
So that's my pick for this week.

947
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,920
i for one am enjoying living in the world of the torment nexus

948
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:38,220
and and no that that podcast does sound very good so i have a i have a satire shaped hole in my

949
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:44,900
listening ever since um they made it so the news quiz isn't isn't on podcasts properly anymore so

950
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:52,161
i shall look that up what why oh i mean this happened ages and ages ago um but they made it

951
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:57,460
so that all of the BBC podcasts are like on a four-week delay rate and for some podcasts that's

952
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:04,240
fine but for news satire it doesn't work quite as well it should be said that might be true for this

953
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,760
as well then well as I said I'm listening I've not got up to date yet and I mean so I'm listening to

954
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,280
podcasts for a year ago but in fact I do remember what was in the political discourse a year ago so

955
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:21,481
it's fine well I also think that a podcast about discourse might need to be less topical than

956
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:27,540
the news quiz I'm going to pick a game I'm going to pick a game that is genre it's called Spirit

957
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:34,720
Island and this is a game that is very highly rated on Board Game Geek and I played it in a

958
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:41,580
board game cafe pre-pandemic and I thought it was a bit crap and then I kind of came back to it later

959
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:47,001
because it so commonly is at the top of these lists and I thought well maybe I should give it

960
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:53,180
another go and actually i do wonder whether it benefits quite a lot from not being played

961
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:59,440
with four players i think maybe the downtime at four player is not very good but sort of two or

962
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,940
three players it kind of hums along quite nicely uh and this is spirit island um and it's a game

963
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:10,300
where the reason i got back into it is because it came up on a panel we had at the excellent

964
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:16,980
reconnect east con in belfast um which was about uh depictions of history in board games

965
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,120
And although Spirit Island is not a historical game, and neither is Settlers of Catan,

966
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,880
they both deal with colonization and colonialism.

967
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,880
And so obviously they're kind of germane to the discussion.

968
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:36,260
And Spirit Island is the explicit kind of new play as the spirits who live on an island that has some native peoples.

969
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,420
And the aim of the game is to repel the invading forces.

970
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,280
The base game comes with Prussia, England and Sweden.

971
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:51,020
And you can buy extra boxes that add other colonial powers and other spirits and things like this.

972
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,600
And it's just very good fun.

973
00:58:53,580 --> 00:59:01,020
And you sort of build your hand of powers by drafting cards from a deck of cards over the course of the game.

974
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,780
And you play those powers to do various nasty things to the colonists.

975
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,200
And yeah, it's good.

976
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:16,720
It is currently slightly hard to get hold of because the company that makes it has had some layoffs due to the tariff situation in the US,

977
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:19,740
but is beginning to come back into print, I think.

978
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:25,480
And also there is a digital version on iOS and on Steam.

979
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,920
So I think the Steam one is currently quite heavily discounted.

980
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,120
I think it's 60% off.

981
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,960
So yeah, I would recommend people go and have a look at that.

982
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,260
It is good. I enjoy it.

983
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:46,560
um it's very popular game for solo play as well as for um across the board play to the app store

984
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,220
page and the steam page in the show notes listeners i've been meaning to play spirit island for ages

985
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:55,880
it's one because because as you say everyone talks about it it's one of the very highly

986
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:00,560
rated games that i've not yet played thank you very much for joining us tommy it has been very lovely

987
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:07,300
thank you for having me and thanks so much tommy that was fantastic you're welcome on that bombshell

988
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,980
That was the Octothorpe podcast.

989
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,360
And it's goodbye from me.

990
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,040
It's goodbye from me.

991
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,360
And it's goodbye from me.

992
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,800
There's a rat, isn't there?

993
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:36,560
Yes.

994
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:37,400
Yes.

995
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,440
That's a rat.

996
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,520
They killed a rat while they made the Abyss.

997
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,900
And as a result of it, it's been...

998
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,260
Cameron won't cut the scene.

999
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:54,180
And the BBFC is absolutely implacable that if you kill animals on screen

1000
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,580
and you actually kill them, you can't have a rating in the UK.

1001
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:58,300
Yeah.

1002
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,580
So I don't know how they've...

1003
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,600
Presumably they have resolved that with a CGI rat or something.

1004
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,500
But anyway.

1005
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,660
No, they haven't.

1006
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,880
It's not out in the UK.

1007
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,320
So how's it got it?

1008
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,580
So, yeah, you can't see it in the UK legally.

1009
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:14,080
So, but the point I'm making is before that even,

1010
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,940
where there was a long time where you just couldn't watch it

1011
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,820
because the DVD version wasn't up to Cameron's standards

1012
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:22,760
and it hadn't been made into an HD version yet.

1013
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,500
So he wouldn't let anyone sell the old version,

1014
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:26,820
but he hadn't made the new version.

1015
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,760
So you just couldn't, like, well, I mean, you could

1016
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,040
because I torrented it, obviously.

1017
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,060
It never came up on, like, Netflix or anything.

1018
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,200
But, yeah, no, I believe it's illegal to see it

1019
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:39,960
or to sort of show it or sell it in the UK unless Cameron has capitulated.

1020
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,440
No, they didn't even kill the rat.

1021
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,920
They'd merely tortured the rat.

1022
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,100
It's illegal to torture animals on screen in the UK.

1023
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,180
Yeah, yeah.

1024
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:49,880
Not a good thing.

1025
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:50,460
Hmm.

1026
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,220
Yeah, but I mean, is it illegal to torture them historically?

1027
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,940
You know, does that mean that there's a load of movies from the past we can't see now

1028
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:03,280
because there's all sorts of classics that have scenes that wouldn't be allowed today?

1029
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:08,220
i don't think that's actually all that true i think the point is that a lot of see a lot of

1030
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:12,960
movies did it off screen and suggested and camera was like no we're actually going to

1031
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:18,980
waterboard a rat on camera which i think is something that a sociopath does and i'm not

1032
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:24,040
sure lots of directors did it because you could just have a picture of a rat and then cut away

1033
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:30,280
to reactions of characters and then cut back to a rat and he chooses not to do that i'm feeling like

1034
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,500
battle scenes in the past

1035
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,820
with horses and things.

1036
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,920
Yeah. Westerns and

1037
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,740
dances with wolves, I thought,

1038
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,380
famously tried to not

1039
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,160
hurt the animals, but by accident

1040
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,220
and unfortunately did.

1041
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,720
But that's why they have, like,

1042
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,520
the no animals were harmed

1043
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:49,640
thing, right?

1044
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:52,360
Yeah, no, I mean, basically, James Cameron

1045
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,280
was the person who made you put that into

1046
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,140
the Code of Conduct.

1047
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,100
Yeah.

1048
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,260
Every film now says no animals were harmed because

1049
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,440
James Cowra was like, no, we're going to use rats.

1050
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:03,820
Five rats, apparently.

1051
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,140
And there's a film called Amoris Perros in which there's a dogfighting scene,

1052
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:12,980
but the dogfighting was simulated, so it was allowed to be screened.

1053
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:19,080
So you can show depictions of animal torture if animals were not actually tortured.

1054
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,260
It is the act of torturing an animal that makes it illegal.

1055
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:25,100
And I basically think that's okay.

1056
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,420
Yes, that.

1057
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,880
But the question is when you go back into the past and say,

1058
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,120
OK, so if you're looking at a film from 100 years ago,

1059
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,300
do films from 100 years ago have to satisfy our current state?

1060
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:40,260
But the thing is, this law was passed in 1937, Alison.

1061
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:45,320
And that was why, because there were other directors injuring other animals.

1062
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:50,600
So I guess I will say that if it's a film from 1936 or earlier,

1063
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,980
maybe there is a very narrow argument that it should be allowed.

1064
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,980
But The Abyss was made in the 80s.

1065
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,240
And so, hmm.

1066
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,980
Anyway, this has been a digression.

1067
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,540
Welcome to the podcast, Tommy.

1068
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,280
We're doing, is this still Chris's loc?

1069
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,140
Yes.

1070
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:07,900
Good.

1071
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,780
But the Abyss is great.

1072
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,480
And despite that scene, I would recommend seeing it.

1073
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,060
But yeah, you might have to go to a place called America.

1074
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,660
Or the internet.

1075
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,660
As we say, look, we're down the back of the internet, super.
