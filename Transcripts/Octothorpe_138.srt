1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,400
All right, John has gone to get a washing machine, so I'm going to go and get a drink.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:24,320
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the very 138th episode of Octothorpe,

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,060
a podcast for science fiction and science fiction fandom, which is entering the inner sanctum,

4
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:40,640
seeing the sacrifice underway and backing out slowly again on the 3rd of July 2025.

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,400
I am John Coxon.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,860
I'm Alison Scott.

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,000
And I'm Liz Batty.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,260
You've got very excitable with these intros.

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,800
Sacrifice is in it.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,620
And we have some letters of comment.

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,300
Yes.

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,000
Shall I do a letter of comment?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,120
Yes.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,400
We have one from Farrah Mendelsohn, and I'll say that we're recording this a little bit early.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,040
So the BSFA AGM has not yet happened for us, but it will have happened for you.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:13,440
So you will know whether the motion to change the way that the Translated Fiction Award works for the BSFA has passed or not.

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:23,280
So Farrah sent us a motion, which is basically the last AGM, there was a decision to appoint a little team to look at the Best Translated Fiction Award and decide if there was a better way for it to work.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,200
And they have a proposal, essentially, to go for a juried shortlist.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,320
By now, you will know if that has passed or not.

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,800
Farrah also worked to us about, because you mentioned the issue of providing judges with books.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,160
And John pointed out the Clark Award.

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,760
Basically, you have to send seven paper copies of your book.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,800
And Farrah says that the Crawford Award, which is for best first fantasy book, now solicits e-books.

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,440
And that has worked really well for them and also allows them to have an international judging panel.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,460
And I think that is crucial, actually, for a Translation Award, you want an international judging panel, I think.

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,340
So the clerk can get away with having all the books posted to judges in the UK, but that might be more difficult if you're going international.

27
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,880
So thank you, Farrah, for some practical comments on how we could run this award.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,040
I think having an international panel and sending out e-books is very wise.

29
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,000
And I think you're right that having an international panel would be a must.

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,160
Yes, and also, say, on the subject of the best translated work, Hugo.

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,100
Jake Sellar-Brookins said he was pleased to hear us discussing it and more on that soon.

32
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,400
So more news as we get it.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,440
Rosanna Pendlebury wrote in on the translated fiction, Hugo, and says that she agreed with much, particularly John.

34
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,120
Hey!

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,560
Sometimes I say sensible things.

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,800
She says, given the aim of putting the world in Worldcon, there's an issue at the core of the Hugo

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:52,920
that it's trying to solve two gaping wounds, the Anglophone-centric nature of publishing and the Anglophone or specifically US-centric voter base.

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:06,800
And she basically says she thinks that having an award and maybe having it be a Hugo award would be a signal that the Worldcon is actually aware of the world outside of these things.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:15,680
And she notes, maybe if there's a cart, we can eventually cajole the horse, bribe it with little snacks of some really quite excellent books.

40
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,980
And then says, if we were to put in the work for a long process, this is a really fruitful thing to work towards and it would make the Hugos richer.

41
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,960
I think that's probably a fair perspective.

42
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,620
So yes.

43
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,460
But I like the idea of sort of if you build it, they will come.

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,780
I think that is a good point.

45
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:41,980
And I note that Rosanna has actually written us quite a long letter through the medium of continuous short blue sky.

46
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,180
What do you call a blue sky?

47
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,140
Skeets.

48
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,220
And I think I'm just old and will never quite get used to this.

49
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,220
It's time for some game theory, Alison.

50
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,200
What was that?

51
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,900
Sorry, that's a reference to that guy on Twitter who used to do like immensely long threads would start time for some game theory.

52
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,720
Okay.

53
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,680
Thank you very much for writing in, Rosanna.

54
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:15,840
And Neil Lottenstein also wrote on translations and suggested we go for best translated short fiction first and then follow with best translated long fiction once the short fiction has become embedded and people are used to it.

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,300
And that might not be a bad idea.

56
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,140
And he also recommends Alex Schwarzman.

57
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,680
And he says, Alex, you might know some people of interest, which is true.

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,480
But Alex has not responded if indeed he saw that.

59
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,580
Alex is a good egg.

60
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,420
I like Alex.

61
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,580
He does the Unidentified Funny Objects anthologies.

62
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,580
Ooh.

63
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,360
He also runs a game shop.

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:41,080
And when I discovered that, I think I asked him what he found to be a tedious number of questions about what it's like to run a game shop.

65
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,300
Because, you know, I'm a nerd.

66
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:56,320
Neil also mentions that there are a bunch of audio awards and lists some and says, given that there are so many audio awards already, maybe that means there isn't a need for a Hugo Award in audio.

67
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,180
But I think none of the existing ones are genre.

68
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,540
And that's the thing that the Hugo has.

69
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,860
It's a specific award for science fiction and fantasy.

70
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,520
Yeah.

71
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,260
We also heard from Christopher J. Garcia.

72
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,160
He notes two things you do not fuck with.

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,720
The Wu-Tang Clan and Disney.

74
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,540
And he also says,

75
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,400
Wusfus is fairly accurate, although the regional variation is freaking Worldcon.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,740
Fair enough.

77
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:28,480
He says that the best juried awards are the ones that have juries of two levels.

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,300
The first being wide view judges, a committee of seven to 11 that present, in essence, a long list.

79
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,420
And then the second tier is five or so people that select the eventual shortlist and winner from those on the long list.

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,340
This is very much how film festivals work, which I did not know.

81
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,300
But that is interesting.

82
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,020
Thank you very much to Chris.

83
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:55,100
And he also says he likes the best translated work idea, although his question is, why only translated to English instead of also translated from English?

84
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,860
And he says he wants, he would absolutely want both the translator and the original author awarded.

85
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:07,960
I think on the subject of translating to or from English, I think things translated from English, I'm not sure.

86
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,380
I think that would bias towards like classics of the English language that get a lot of translations.

87
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,500
And so I'm not sure.

88
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,520
I don't know whether I think that would like expose anyone to very interesting anything.

89
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,540
But maybe I am being overly, overly cynical.

90
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,320
I don't know.

91
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:34,320
I think then you get the potential issue that the Hugo electorate would be mostly voting on the English language original, not the translation, because very few of the electorate will read the translation.

92
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,640
So then it just turns into which of these five books that you may have read some time ago, if the translations were delayed, do you like the best?

93
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,380
Which is a bit, I don't know, it doesn't feel quite the same.

94
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:52,820
And also it's that ends up also sort of rewarding the authors who get foreign translations, which is probably going to be the most popular ones.

95
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,300
Yeah, that's a good point.

96
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,320
That's a very good point.

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,200
Although I do.

98
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:02,340
I do keep an eye out for what is getting translated when I go to book fairs and bookshops and so on.

99
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,500
And there are, for instance, some beautiful N.K.

100
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,780
Jemisin translations I've seen here.

101
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,060
And I think RF Kuang got translated.

102
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,540
A few other things.

103
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,440
But it doesn't, I mean, it's not always looking like it's like Hugo Award winners or something.

104
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,180
There is a bit more variety in there.

105
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,820
But it's going to be very different for every different country, I think.

106
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,240
Bridget on Facebook says,

107
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,780
I found Elizabeth in the wild from the Marmite Prize 2008 catalogue.

108
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,020
It seems to have spider legs.

109
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:35,000
And it took me a minute here because the actual picture she sent was in a post, a comment, a few comments down.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,460
But it's some kind of hybrid creature with spider legs and bat wings and I think a lizard head.

111
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,320
Right.

112
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,280
It's weird.

113
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,020
Thank you, Bridget.

114
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,180
It sounds absolutely terrifying.

115
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,440
Oh, it's on our Facebook page if you want to look.

116
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,480
It is exciting.

117
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,660
I saw, I didn't click through.

118
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,300
And now I'm wondering, should I click through or shouldn't I?

119
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,180
Because it does sound scary.

120
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,240
It's not that scary.

121
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,220
It's not very scary.

122
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,840
Does have my name for some reason.

123
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,760
Hmm.

124
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,120
I guess because it's a lizard bat.

125
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
Yeah, I think.

126
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,900
Yeah.

127
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,920
Or a bat lizard.

128
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,340
Paul Weimer wrote to us.

129
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,020
He heard my comment last time that I, quote, quite like a bit of smut.

130
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:20,080
And insists that I shall strongly suggest that I read The Mercy Makers by Tessa Grattan.

131
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,180
It's a fantasy novel and there is indeed, in addition to an interesting protagonist,

132
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,360
chewy world building and lots of lush and sensuous detail and plotting, quite a lot of smut.

133
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,780
So much that Paul put a spoiler warning in his review.

134
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,400
I think he means a trigger warning rather than a spoiler warning here.

135
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,100
The review might or might not be up by the time you read this or read from this on air.

136
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:50,060
Ange points out that we missed a celebrity translator in our discussion of translation last episode.

137
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:59,920
So Ange notes the translators Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge, who translated Asterix into English.

138
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,220
And I've put a link in the show notes to an article on their translations.

139
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,300
They are, their translations add a lot to Asterix in English.

140
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:17,540
And one of the best examples is that in the French, Asterix's dog is called idea fix, which is kind of fixated on an idea.

141
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,280
But in English, they translated it to dogmatics, which means the same thing, but is also a pun on the word dog.

142
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:30,060
So there are actually instances in the English where extra jokes are added in translation because the translators were very good.

143
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:37,460
And I think that is a very good example of a good translation team and what translators can add to a work.

144
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,240
So thank you very much for writing, Ange.

145
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,380
Ange also thanks me for reminding her that Tinkley was the first place I saw Henry VIII and his six wives envisioned as cats.

146
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,480
First place?

147
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,360
Louise Hughes, I think a first time writer, wrote to us on Blue Sky to say,

148
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm definitely not a Geordie and would not claim to be.

149
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,900
My Durham accent is totally different.

150
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:07,000
But there are Geordies in the historic county of Durham, now South Tyneside, which I mean, of course there are.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,640
Yes.

152
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,100
Thank you very much for writing in.

153
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:19,900
When Espanya got her citizenship, the mayor of the Lord Mayor, probably, whoever it was at the ceremony,

154
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,980
said that everyone there was a Geordie.

155
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,740
So Espanya is a Geordie.

156
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,880
But I am not.

157
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,440
Oh, I mean, if you get your citizenship in Newcastle, then presumably you are automatically a Geordie, yes?

158
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,560
I think that was indeed the implication.

159
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,640
I can tell from her accent, really.

160
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,300
Yeah.

161
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,060
When she says YI, it works very well.

162
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:56,320
So, one of the bids for the 2027 Worldcon is Montreal, which had been being chaired by Terry Fong in its bid stage.

163
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:05,280
But he has stepped down for personal reasons, according to a post that Montreal made on Blue Sky.

164
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:14,580
And Darren Briskman had taken the role of interim bid chair until site selection, which rather makes me think that he's taken the role of bid chair.

165
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,680
Because if you're going to be bid chair until the bid's no longer a bid, that's not really into him.

166
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,940
But anyway, Briskman's done a bunch of stuff.

167
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,280
He worked on Glasgow as the platform operation manager for online convention.

168
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,240
And he was one of the heroes of Con Zealand.

169
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,500
So, I'm sure he is great.

170
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,380
The comments on Fast 770 are quite interesting.

171
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,300
There's two comments out of the nine that jumped out at me.

172
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,200
One of them is that on the Montreal website, on their core values page,

173
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,800
JM notes that that page says,

174
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,660
We understand that there are some questions regarding some of our staff and committee members.

175
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,440
We believe in redemption and the ability to atone.

176
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,640
All of these people recognise their past errors and are committing to doing better and serving fandom and our communities.

177
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,720
Circumstances differ in each case and safeguards have been employed,

178
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,540
but we are willing to allow them to make reparations to the best of their abilities.

179
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,600
And they asked, who are they talking about?

180
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,300
Which is a fair comment.

181
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,340
And then Robbie Bourget wrote, saying,

182
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,240
This is a bid committee failing to talk with its organising board, Kansmoth.

183
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,720
We will issue better and more correct information within a week.

184
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,540
Robbie Bourget, Kansmoth Board.

185
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,600
Now, we are recording listeners on the 19th of June, which is quite soon after all this came out.

186
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,040
We might have to do a little pickup if more information does come out.

187
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,300
But right now, it all looks a little bit weird.

188
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,380
Not weird that a chair has stepped down.

189
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,200
That happens.

190
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,520
And that was entirely uncontroversial.

191
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,500
But Robbie's comment, particularly on Fast 770,

192
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,780
makes it sound like there's a lot happening that is not being made public.

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,860
And it just seems like a really weird comment for the chair of the Kansmoth Board to make on Fast 770.

194
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,720
What do we think about this?

195
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,080
I think we probably wouldn't be talking about this except for that comment on Fast 770.

196
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:05,980
So this is one of those cases where I think you just don't say anything until you have a comment to put out that's not mysterious.

197
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,480
Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of mysterious comments going on.

198
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,140
I think we probably would be mentioning it, the fact that Terry Fong has stepped down,

199
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,460
when John said it's one of the bids for 2027.

200
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,920
Montreal is the only bid that's filed papers for 2027.

201
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,580
Yes, because the other one was Tel Aviv, which has not filed for obvious reasons.

202
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,800
Yeah, but I haven't, I mean, I haven't been keeping tracks on it that much.

203
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,840
But there is often the strong thing of having a bid chair who will then step down when you become an actual con.

204
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,280
So it is also possible this is just a case of the bid chair who was planning to carry on for another couple of months,

205
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,880
has had an attack of real life and needs to step down and hand over to someone else.

206
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,540
But there was always someone else coming in for the actual con anyway.

207
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,640
So, yeah.

208
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,280
I had put it in the show notes before I'd read the comments.

209
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,840
So, like, I think we would probably have talked about it,

210
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,480
but I don't think we would have, we probably would have noted it in passing and then moved on.

211
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:06,460
But I am super intrigued as to what the miscommunication or the beef between the parent organisation and the bid could be.

212
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,740
I don't know what that is.

213
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,680
And it does seem like the sort of thing you'd probably want to address internally rather than externally.

214
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,600
But maybe I'm incorrect. I don't know.

215
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,400
Did you know their website has a page on how to prepare smoked meat in a hotel room?

216
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,140
Er.

217
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,700
That doesn't seem unreasonable because they were famous for doing that.

218
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,540
I did not know it. It doesn't seem unreasonable. It does sound cool, though.

219
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,100
I've been to one of their parties who smoked meat, I don't think.

220
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,560
Lots of maple syrup and so on.

221
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,100
I feel I've missed out.

222
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,880
Oh.

223
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,060
Well, maybe it was just that I went to a party with smoked meat at Montreal in 2009.

224
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,260
That was probably actually somebody else because Montreal won't have been running parties then.

225
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:53,020
The Montreal in 2027 Facebook page, this is something that Jerry pointed out to me the other day,

226
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,300
has 10 likes and 20 followers.

227
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,360
Wow.

228
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,540
Those are some pretty good numbers.

229
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,040
For you, I've had a stuffed moose with more likes and followers on Facebook than that.

230
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
I think we did better for punctuation, didn't we?

231
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,220
I think we can say that the Montreal bid is a bit under the radar and that might not be a problem

232
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:21,660
if it was like last time Montreal bid when there were lots of bids, but they are the de facto going to be a world con.

233
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,580
And so it would be nice if we saw a bit more from them before Seattle.

234
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,940
And hopefully the change of bid share is what that's about.

235
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,300
Yeah, I think that's right.

236
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,900
I don't think Montreal have been doing an amazing job here.

237
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,700
And I am sort of wondering whether what has happened is that Terry has realized that's true

238
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:50,540
and realized he doesn't have time to do this and a step decided to enable the bid to kind of maybe spool up a little bit

239
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,960
before the actual site selection meeting.

240
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,160
But I'm kind of eager.

241
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,320
That doesn't really fit with the sort of thing that Robbie posted.

242
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,140
So that's clearly not the whole story.

243
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,160
And I'm very intrigued to see what the whole story is.

244
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,900
Their website has a whiff of the GeoCities about it.

245
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,460
Wow, Liz.

246
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,380
Wow.

247
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,480
It's the fake parchment background.

248
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,780
That's what does it.

249
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,240
Are you saying that fake parchment isn't in style?

250
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,140
Yes.

251
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,120
What's important about a website isn't whether or not it's in style.

252
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,660
It's whether it has good content.

253
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,440
It doesn't have good content.

254
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,140
Well, no, to be fair, I've just said it will teach me how to smoke meat in a hotel bathroom.

255
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,940
So.

256
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,020
Well, and also, I think both are important.

257
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,520
Oh, it's got a lot of stuff about food, doesn't it?

258
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,620
It does have a lot of stuff about Montreal and food.

259
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:46,060
Because if the style of the website and the design wasn't important, then style guides would be unnecessary.

260
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,760
But we know that they are necessary.

261
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,800
So clearly, it's a balance of both.

262
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,580
Mm-mm.

263
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:57,540
I think the comparison is because I was having a look at the LA comm website for something the other day.

264
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,840
And...

265
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,400
It's much better.

266
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,300
It just looks really nice and clean and up to date.

267
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,040
Yes.

268
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,820
And I was getting some slight throwback vibes from Montreal.

269
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,720
I think...

270
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,220
No, I think...

271
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,260
I think it is a fair comment.

272
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,600
Um, 100%.

273
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm old enough to remember when Eastercom websites were Times New Roman and tables.

274
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,080
Also fair to say, I absolutely could not make a better website in any way.

275
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,200
So...

276
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,620
You could install WordPress on a server somewhere, Liz.

277
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,320
Oh, I have, in fact, installed WordPress on a server.

278
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,620
Yeah, you're right.

279
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,220
Great.

280
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,160
So that was Montreal.

281
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,080
We don't know much.

282
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,420
We'll tell you more when we know more.

283
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,280
But it's interesting.

284
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,160
I want smoked meat now.

285
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,500
But I have to say, I'm a bit shocked by the whole prepare it in a hotel bathroom.

286
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:46,300
And I think this must be something about differing electrical standards in the US and the UK or in Canada and the UK here.

287
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,900
I haven't read it in detail.

288
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:55,620
So I am not sure if you smoke the meat in the bathroom or just, like, prepare it once the hot plate is off.

289
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,920
I think, but there is a photo of what looks like a bathroom sink and a plug socket next to it.

290
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,840
I think you buy previously made smoked meat from somebody.

291
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,660
I don't think they're actually running a smoker in a hotel bathroom because that would be quite funny.

292
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,340
No, you're just running your crock pot.

293
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,580
Listeners, if you've run a full-on smoker in a hotel bathroom, please let us know.

294
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,380
Actually, just tell us, like, the most exciting thing you have made in a hotel bathroom.

295
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,180
Oh, no.

296
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:38,160
We have now got some information from Seattle on the subject of the 2025 WUSFUS business meeting.

297
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,340
There is an agenda.

298
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,540
There are virtual meeting instructions.

299
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,320
There are the results of a consultative vote.

300
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,740
There are plans to have a Discord.

301
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,720
It's all very exciting.

302
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,520
We'll start with the consultative vote.

303
00:18:52,520 --> 00:19:01,880
343 members expressed their views on the chosen proposals from the business passed on from Glasgow.

304
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:09,280
Having a quick old look at the membership list for Seattle, I think they've got in excess of 2,000 members.

305
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,940
I think they've got at least 2,000 members who could have voted.

306
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:21,820
But the turnout is sort of no greater than 17% and maybe substantially lower if there are much more than 1,000 attending members, which I would expect there are.

307
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:31,620
Basically, 164 people voted to say that they would like to eliminate the Retro Hugos and 167 voted to say that they wouldn't like to eliminate them.

308
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,780
And the total was 331 votes cast.

309
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,760
So that is not what you'd call an overwhelming majority.

310
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,800
It is 50.4%.

311
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,940
So the quest for a 48-52 good-bad poll continues unabated.

312
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,200
And this has not given us the result we won, Graham.

313
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,480
Sorry.

314
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,520
Yeah, we don't have the resounding success of a 52-48 poll here, do we?

315
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,160
No.

316
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,540
And then the vote to amend Hugo Award categories for best fan and professional.

317
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,860
The no's again had it.

318
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,920
There were 160 votes out of 284 were for no.

319
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,460
And that means that about 56% of the vote was for no.

320
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:21,640
So what this basically indicates is that both of these are really quite split issues in the community.

321
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,740
And there's not much consensus amongst the wider membership, which I probably could have told you.

322
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,000
But I think we knew that already, which is why they were having consulted votes.

323
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,500
Yeah.

324
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,200
Not sure what this has added.

325
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,920
No, it has added something.

326
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,720
It has added the fact that we now know there are numbers.

327
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,380
That's good.

328
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:50,500
But like, it is definitely true that I feel like if we had thought that if there was a huge sort of groundswell of support for one or the other of these, we probably would have heard about it.

329
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,020
So it's not surprising that the numbers don't indicate there is such a thing.

330
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:12,520
You know, not everybody who attends the world con is interested in the inner workings of world con politics.

331
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,380
Though you would think they were sometimes, but they're not.

332
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:27,720
And even because our regular form of democracy in the world con is a village meeting, a town meeting, essentially a business meeting to which any member can attend.

333
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,540
31 is a lot more votes than you're going to get for any individual resolution at an in-person business meeting.

334
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,560
And I suspect also in the online business meeting.

335
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:43,960
So it's actually quite good as a test of what the world con thinks, I think.

336
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,240
Yeah, no, I would agree.

337
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,520
I think that is true.

338
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:55,140
I want to say, like, I am, I guess I am sort of trying to draw conclusions about the nature of the turnout.

339
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:01,420
I do definitely agree that this is a higher turnout than you'd get by having a business meeting in person.

340
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:08,680
But I also will say, I think this is partly because I'm not sure the consultative vote was very well publicized.

341
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,420
And I think it ran.

342
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:19,980
I don't know why it's not still running, because I do think it came out after the agenda was published or it came out simultaneous with the agenda being published.

343
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,580
So it's not like before.

344
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,540
How much before do we know?

345
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,440
Hang on while I go and check on the blue sky what it was.

346
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,920
But I mean, I think it came out before the agenda, but probably after the business deadline.

347
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,460
Let me check that one, though.

348
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,060
Okay.

349
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:41,580
I guess what I want to say is I'm not sure it's ended early enough for it to be able to inform any of the motions that were put to the meeting.

350
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,580
And I'm not and I'm not sure.

351
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:51,880
Therefore, it coming out as early as it did is actually all that helpful, because I think it's you just need to know by the time you vote on the ratification.

352
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,560
I'm not sure you need to know a month in advance of ratification.

353
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,900
If you can't really react to it in any other way than sort of pontificating on your podcast.

354
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,020
Yeah, I will say that my comparison is that Glasgow in 2024 ran a very similar exercise.

355
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,280
And having gone back and looked at their website, they also only kept it open for two weeks.

356
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:16,120
But I think they just, one, it was close to the con, so probably more people had joined, but that's because their business meeting was later.

357
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,500
But also, I mean, they got 1260 votes, which is...

358
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,640
Yeah, I was going to come back to that as well.

359
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah.

360
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,820
Did you also notice what the vote tallies were, John?

361
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,760
42.3% to 57.7%.

362
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,060
It's not quite the 48-52, is it?

363
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
But yeah, inverse or something.

364
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,780
Oh no, that's quite a big majority.

365
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:40,420
Yeah, but then in the actual business meeting, it was a crushing majority for not passing those.

366
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,220
So...

367
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,960
Oh, it's definitely interesting.

368
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,700
I think it might be interesting to compare these to the ratios by which they were passed at Glasgow.

369
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,800
Do you have those ratios to hand, Liz?

370
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,880
Oh, no.

371
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

372
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,380
Hold on.

373
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,640
Being made to do work by the evil John, her nemesis.

374
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,440
You're not really my nemesis, John.

375
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,820
I could be your nemesis, Liz.

376
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,300
How dare you take my dreams of being your nemesis away?

377
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,160
All right, hang on.

378
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,440
There were a lot of motions last time.

379
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:23,780
Right, so I hate to disappoint you here, John, but I went and looked up that motion and the minutes of it in the business meeting minutes 24.

380
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,160
And the thing is that no one spoke in favour of ratification.

381
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,220
And so ratification failed by a show of hands.

382
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:37,560
So we don't know what the outcome was, only that it was not close enough that you needed to do a full vote.

383
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,520
Well, I mean, and that there was no one in the room prepared to speak for it.

384
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,300
No, I mean, sorry, I think I might have mis-expressed myself.

385
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,640
I was wondering, there is, we voted to amend the constitution to eliminate the retro-Hugos at Glasgow.

386
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,560
Oh, the retros.

387
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,040
Sorry, I've looked at the wrong one.

388
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,840
But now I can go and find that, right?

389
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,400
And so, like, that did, so the vote here is 50.5% or whatever I said it was.

390
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,960
How overwhelming in favour was it in the business meeting?

391
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,420
Like, just because I wonder how much of a microcosm the business meeting is of the membership.

392
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,440
And now we know the microcosm of the membership, we could compare.

393
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,340
It's not, because, again, it passed by a show of hands.

394
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,800
Boo!

395
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,880
But again, that means it can't possibly have been within 10% of 50, right?

396
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,440
Yeah.

397
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,320
Because if it was, they'd have gone to Serpentine.

398
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,900
Yeah.

399
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:38,400
So, it must be significantly, the opinion against the retro-Hugos is therefore presumably significantly

400
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,880
more pronounced in the business meeting than it is amongst the membership who voted on this.

401
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,480
Whether the membership who voted on this is representative, we don't know, but...

402
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,440
That's consistent generally with...

403
00:25:49,440 --> 00:26:01,420
So, Hugo non-proliferation is something that concerns the people who have to do all the work a lot more than it does people who just have to enjoy awards ceremonies and vote for awards who quite like them.

404
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,880
Because we're going to discuss the retro-Hugos again later, so maybe we should just get on with it because that's going to come back.

405
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,300
Foreshadowing.

406
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,180
Yeah.

407
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,560
Talk about the agenda.

408
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,580
Go, Liz!

409
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,300
There is a business meeting agenda.

410
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:22,820
I am delighted to discover, by the way, that I don't fully understand how time zones work and did the daylight savings time correction the wrong way.

411
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,900
So, I might get able to go to some of the virtual business meeting.

412
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,280
Woo!

413
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,980
Yay, Liz!

414
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,780
But not all of it unless I want to stay up till 2am.

415
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:38,540
But yes, they have published a big page of instructions on how to join the virtual business meeting, which I...

416
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:44,960
Let's face it, I've skimmed it because if you give me a big thing full of screenshots, I will inevitably skim it and then go and search if I can't figure out what's going on.

417
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,320
But I did note there's a section at the end which is basically how to host a watch party.

418
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:59,480
So, if you want to have multiple people in one place, say, at another convention doing a watch party, it seems like the way you do it is you get a non-voting login that you can put up on screen and everyone can watch.

419
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:06,100
And then everyone logs in on their own phones or devices or whatever to do voting and speaking and so on.

420
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,140
So, it seems like it's a little bit complicated to request to speak from a watch party.

421
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:16,920
But they have put together information on how to do this and even on how you can try and have two people on one device.

422
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,540
So, it seems like they are trying quite hard to accommodate those.

423
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:29,120
They also said that the convention run Discord server for members who wish to chat about the business meeting and it will just basically become active just before the business meeting and then go and read only afterwards.

424
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:37,140
And so, I think it will let you like do some quick chatting and do that sort of thing that sometimes happens on con Discords of saying, oh, I don't quite understand that motion.

425
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,440
Can anyone explain how it worked?

426
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,980
Someone will probably pop up and help explain it to you.

427
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,580
This sort of thing is the absolute best thing about convention Discords.

428
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,260
Yes.

429
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,400
It's a great use case.

430
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,580
So, I'm glad that they've recognised that the convention Discord is really helpful for that.

431
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:57,680
And so, rather than just spinning up the main con Discord early, they're just going to have like a business meeting one.

432
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:07,240
I will also say that while I have not consulted it because I started reading before this was out, there is a big guide to the business meeting and each motion written by Kate Seacore,

433
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,820
which will help clarify a lot of the stuff I don't understand about constitutional business because I don't understand Robert's Rules of Order very well.

434
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,260
Woo!

435
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:23,140
A colleague unironically recommended that I read Robert's Rules of Order and then got quite surprised when I reacted very vehemently to that suggestion.

436
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,460
I was like, you don't understand.

437
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,280
This isn't a suggestion of vacuum, Matt.

438
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,300
This is, there's history here.

439
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,400
But yes.

440
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,160
Sorry, Liz.

441
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,940
The agenda.

442
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,840
The agenda.

443
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,620
It's quite long.

444
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,340
Yeah.

445
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,420
And I might have thoughts about that later.

446
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:46,680
So, we're not going to go through everything on the agenda like we infamously did in a very long episode pre-WorldCon last year,

447
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,320
which some people apparently liked.

448
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,520
And I don't know if they're just masochists, to be honest.

449
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:00,100
When we do our Patreon, we can have some real nitty gritty stuff for the perverts.

450
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:09,440
Oh, you can pick your favourite constitutional claim, constitutional change, and make me explain it for every dollar you donate to our Patreon.

451
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,900
I think you mean our OnlyFans.

452
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,220
Yes.

453
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,180
All right.

454
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,540
So, there's a few things to point out.

455
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,840
A few things I want to pick out.

456
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,480
And one of those things is executive sessions.

457
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:35,000
So, in 2024, there were basically a bunch of resolutions about the 2023 Hugo Awards, which, as we all know, were a bit of a shit show.

458
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,540
Oh, are we going to get a swearing warning if I say that?

459
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,640
I already said fuck.

460
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,360
Okay.

461
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:48,140
Basically, they determined that these should be handled as though they're disciplinary proceedings, which means they have to be an executive session.

462
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:56,200
An executive concession is basically you go into a session that must not be devolved to non-WUSFUS members.

463
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,100
The minutes will be as minimal as necessary.

464
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:08,980
And so, the report back from the investigative committee looking into the 2023 Hugo Awards will report back in executive session.

465
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,660
Yeah.

466
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,860
It seems like this will not.

467
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,200
So, this portion of the meeting will not be live streamed or contained in the posted recording of the business meeting.

468
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:15,760
Yeah.

469
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,480
I don't quite know how that's going to work, but it will be interesting to see.

470
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,600
And it says that one will happen at the main meeting on July 13th.

471
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,120
And the first meeting is July 4th, but that is the preliminary business meeting setting of timings and so on.

472
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,320
So, there is an investigative committee that is reported back.

473
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,880
And it has reported back with a few recommendations, but their full report will be in executive session.

474
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,160
Shall I see if I can fish out those constitutional changes?

475
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,640
So, there's basically a report from the investigation committee on the 2023 Hugo Awards.

476
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,500
And I think some of this will be discussed in executive session.

477
00:30:51,500 --> 00:31:06,080
The recommendations are, one, that the long list entries committee adds on something to say, you know, approximately 30 nominees were excluded from the final ballot of the 2023 Hugo Awards for reasons other than the nominating procedures prescribed, which seems totally reasonable.

478
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,160
And one to make it, a technical change to make it harder to start an executive committee.

479
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,040
And the rest of it will all be an executive session.

480
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,420
So, I don't think we can report on it, because some of you might not be members of WUSFUS.

481
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,280
Not even if you all pinky swear to join WUSFUS listeners, can we report on it.

482
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,880
So, yeah.

483
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,140
On to less confusing and probably more debatable things.

484
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:34,400
There is an amendment to introduce a Hugo for best poem, a science fiction or fantasy poem of any line length or word count.

485
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,320
So, this is basically, let's take the one we're running this year and keep it.

486
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:49,500
They have a website with some rationale, which basically talks about which authors have written poems, how many other speculative fiction awards have awards for poems.

487
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,320
A pretty good justification, I think, of why they need a poetry category.

488
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,600
I personally am agnostic on the subject of poetry.

489
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,780
But if you're going to propose a new Hugo category, I think this is a good way to go about it.

490
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,820
Thoughts on poetry?

491
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,500
We covered this a bit in the last episode, didn't we?

492
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,140
I think we've talked about this.

493
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,680
I want to see what the Hugo, what the WUSFUS members think on this.

494
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:17,740
I feel like it's not quite baked enough for me yet, but I may be behind the times.

495
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,840
I don't know how more baked it could be.

496
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,520
Okay.

497
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:28,400
I think, just to quickly say something about poetry, if you look at the number of people who nominated poems,

498
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:36,460
like, or sorry, if you look at the number of ballots needed to get a poem on the shortlist in these Hugos,

499
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:50,760
I am, I think, unpersuaded that that is a category that has the knowledge in the Hugo votership to be sustainable, really.

500
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,480
But maybe this is a cart before the horse argument again.

501
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,040
I don't know.

502
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,780
Oh, how many ballots was it?

503
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,040
I'm not...

504
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,800
Best poem, finalists range from 11 to 26.

505
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,920
11.

506
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,800
Okay.

507
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,800
But the thing is, it's not the bottom.

508
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,160
One, I think you can't really tell from the range, right?

509
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,960
Because a lot of them have quite low ranges.

510
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:22,620
As far as I can tell, 11 is the lowest lower bound of any of the categories that were on the ballot from Seattle.

511
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,820
And it might just be that, I mean, so there's two considerations here, right?

512
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,880
Which is there are a lot of poems.

513
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:35,340
So there were 266 nominees in poem compared to, for instance, Fancast is 197.

514
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:44,660
But even so, like, the number of ballots cast is lower than almost all of the categories.

515
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,620
Not all of them.

516
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,540
It's higher than Best Editor Longform.

517
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,920
It's higher than Both Artist Categories.

518
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,520
Those are the only ones that's higher than.

519
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:59,180
But like Rosanna said in her Blue Sky things, like, there is an element here of putting the cart before the horse so that you actually attract people.

520
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,060
Like, if you make a poem a Hugo thing, people will read more poems.

521
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,380
So you might find that those numbers go up over time.

522
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,780
But it's not clear to me.

523
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,820
It certainly...

524
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,080
I think it would work as a Hugo.

525
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,460
It's just whether or not those numbers are strong enough.

526
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,180
But I don't think it's like LA Con, where it just clearly wasn't going to happen for game because there wasn't the literacy at all.

527
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,100
That all makes sense.

528
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:23,820
Yeah, so I also feel a bit guilty here because I have not actually read the poems in my Hugo voter packet.

529
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,780
And I clearly should.

530
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,820
And then I probably have a better sense of whether I think we've been given some excellent stuff to look at.

531
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:37,860
The issue is, if you're going to say, oh, well, not enough people really voted or nominated in poem for it to be a viable category,

532
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,780
then there are categories that we already have that we are keeping around that get lower votes than that.

533
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,140
And so if that's your argument, it's quite hard to make an argument for keeping some of the other ones.

534
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,140
No, I think we've just established there aren't.

535
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,960
That it's got...

536
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,140
That despite being a kind of showcase category for this year, it's had fewer nominations than...

537
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,980
Fewer nominations and a lower requirement to get on the ballot than any other category.

538
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,860
Yeah, we've noted that you only needed 11 nominations to get on the ballot, but you only needed 13 to get on Invest Graphic Story.

539
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:16,720
And it's got more people casting ballots than, you know, fan artist or pro artist or best editor long form.

540
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:25,540
Like, I don't think the ranges are that big that you can say this is obviously not something that the votership is as interested in as it is for other categories.

541
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,960
Because it's in the range.

542
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,000
I think it's sitting in the range of the lower one.

543
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:37,320
There is a new amendment to retire NASFIC, which basically just deletes the bits of the Constitution that refer to NASFICs.

544
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,160
And then we, like, abandon the NASFIC service mark.

545
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,200
And there you go.

546
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,900
And I think the thing is...

547
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,360
Haven't we been trying to do this for a while?

548
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,480
No, I think we've been talking about doing this for a while.

549
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,740
And meanwhile, the NASFIC has just been gently dying.

550
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,360
And now we're like, well, let's officially just kill it.

551
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,460
I'm down with this.

552
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,800
We have, as already mentioned, the ratification of removing the retro Hugos.

553
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,400
And so, obviously, this year we have an amendment to save the retro Hugos.

554
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,580
And also say that you could hold them in a multiple of 10 years after a year with no Hugos rather than 25.

555
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,240
I think the argument being here that we've only got seven or maybe eight years left to go.

556
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:25,380
Let's just say you could do them 10 years after any year wasn't awarded and we can barrel through them and we'll get them done.

557
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,020
But it's going to be interesting.

558
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,440
Is that amendment...

559
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,660
Is that amendment's short title the let's get it over with amendment?

560
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,060
And if not, why not?

561
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:40,880
No, it's called save the retro Hugos from a bunch of people who were not going in with the making a funny name for our amendment scheme.

562
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,660
Boo.

563
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,560
One of the very few good bits about the agenda.

564
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,020
What I'm interested to see is whether we end up taking up ratifying...

565
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:57,180
I don't even know if you can do the amendments for ratifying the retro Hugos removal and the one for saving the retro Hugos at the same time, basically.

566
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,540
Because it would be hilarious if one business meeting, say on...

567
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,700
You know, if on the 13th of July we ratify abolishing the retros and then a week later...

568
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,040
That would be hilarious, yes.

569
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,260
And not necessarily the same set of people save them.

570
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:16,420
Yeah, what happens if something amends text that's no longer in the constitution, Liz?

571
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,420
Is there precedent?

572
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,220
I don't know.

573
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,460
I'm going to guess no.

574
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,540
Don't ask me about Robert's Rules of Order.

575
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,240
Okay.

576
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,820
I withdraw the question.

577
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,100
I presume you would then have to amend the amendment to...

578
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:36,560
Like, you'd just have to do an amendment to say, you know, oh, we'll put a blue underline under all of this text because it's now all new and we're putting it back again.

579
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,420
I will not...

580
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:44,720
Yeah, there is nothing in the Whispers Constitution that says you can't have a thing that's up for ratification and then have something that basically reverses the thing that's up for ratification.

581
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:57,700
On a similar note, last year there was a motion brought to essentially put minimum standards on locations for filing a WorldCom bid, as we discussed a lot in 2023 and 2024.

582
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,020
And it failed.

583
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:05,080
And so it's basically back in a very similar form.

584
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:12,000
I mean, maybe this is special because I think the world and in particular the bits of the world where we hold WorldCom may have changed a little bit since last year.

585
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,960
But it also feels like at this time you could be saying, well, my amendment failed last year, so I'm going to bring it back this year and next year and every other year until it passes or you get fed up.

586
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,140
Yeah, we need...

587
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,040
So one of the things that...

588
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,420
And we might get to this a little bit later.

589
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:38,680
But one of the things that we discussed in the committee that Farrah Mendelsohn was heading up was how to take some of this asynchronous, how to change some of the procedures around all of this.

590
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,580
And there are basically four subcommittees, each of which submitted a short report.

591
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:50,740
But one of them is kind of how do we put a filter on the agenda so that only things get on that are worth discussing.

592
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,940
And I do think the...

593
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:58,960
Basically, what I'm going to suggest, Liz, is demand management, which Liz will immediately understand and I will have to explain to listeners.

594
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:17,540
But basically, demand management is this thing in British funding councils and presumably elsewhere as well, but I'm familiar with it in Britain, where the funding councils basically say, if your university is submitting too many proposals that are not getting accepted, we will put a cap on the number of proposals you are allowed to submit until your quality goes up.

595
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:23,080
And so if we did that to people submitting amendments, if you get an amendment through, you can submit an amendment next year.

596
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,460
But if you don't, two years out for you, that might help a bit with the proliferation, but we will see.

597
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,560
It might.

598
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:42,340
So one of the things you've got here is people who are longstanding Wusfus people offering to help people who are Wusfus bunnies have a go at putting an amendment in.

599
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,740
And you don't want to discourage that work.

600
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,720
I don't want to discourage that work.

601
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:56,840
My proposal would help that work by encouraging people to talk about their proposals in advance and solicit the opinion of the community and maybe some review of their proposal,

602
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:02,120
rather than just slapping it in willy nilly because, you know, you reckon it might be good.

603
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,180
See also previous episodes on building up community consensus.

604
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:16,860
Yeah, no, I certainly I think where something's been knocked back, having it come back unchanged time after time is very tiresome and wastes everybody's time.

605
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:22,340
Yeah, I do feel in general that looking through this agenda, there is a lot of stuff in there.

606
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:30,500
And it's hard for me to tell what will just pass through with no issues and what will actually be something people have strong opinions on.

607
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,980
See, EG, most year, the extended eligibility motions pass quite handily.

608
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:42,320
And then last year we didn't we had the issue with Godzilla minus one where it wasn't quite so obvious.

609
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:51,460
And so if there was some way that we could be saying, OK, yeah, you know, rather than take up any time where people actually have to be sitting there synchronously doing stuff.

610
00:40:51,600 --> 00:41:00,720
But something like, say, there's an amendment somewhere that basically adds two words that would very slightly change the meaning of something.

611
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,620
So D7, this is, would add the words that are into one particular clause.

612
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:09,440
And possibly there's a big side issue that I haven't noticed there for why we shouldn't do it.

613
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,640
But I'm pretty sure that one is just going to be like a minor change.

614
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,500
And couldn't we get this out of the way?

615
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,620
Yeah, asynchronously.

616
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:22,580
And along with the eligibility extensions for films that were only released in 10 cinemas in 2024.

617
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,220
And then we'll have more time for the other stuff.

618
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,280
I think this is basically what John has written up in a more organised manner.

619
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,780
And I'm just making it up off the top of my head.

620
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,200
But yeah, this is.

621
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,460
Yeah.

622
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:38,040
So if you're interested in that sort of idea, listeners, check out my subcommittee report.

623
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,760
Because yes.

624
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,080
But no, I mean, Liz has put it very well there.

625
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,460
I think there are some things which we could absolutely just farm out.

626
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,400
Very minor wording changes and eligibility extensions are probably amongst them.

627
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,660
Isn't that what the nitpicking and flyspecking committee is supposed to do?

628
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,160
Or am I?

629
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,660
They submit motions.

630
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,140
Yeah, but then they have to submit them as proposals and motions at the business meeting.

631
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,840
Rather than just one saying here, these are 19 things we've noted.

632
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,600
Well, I mean, at the moment, we don't allow the nitpicking and flyspecking

633
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,080
committee to change things unilaterally, which is probably correct.

634
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,500
But neither do I think that we definitely need to sit through all of them as a full, you know,

635
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,960
debate that we assign debate times to or, you know, pass them through or whatever.

636
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,420
So it does seem like, yeah, you could get away with some of this being done asynchronously.

637
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:32,620
And John has a nice report, which explains a bit more detail about how we would do this.

638
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,340
And maybe do you want to discuss that in more detail now?

639
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,560
Or shall we leave it a bit later?

640
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,840
Well, let's do it later.

641
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,380
All right.

642
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,260
Foreshadowing.

643
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:40,760
Yeah.

644
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,180
All right.

645
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,280
It's the appropriate point.

646
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,120
John will give us the two minute version.

647
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,460
So, yeah, I'm still like cherry picking from the many, many things here.

648
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:55,040
I will say there's one amendment where I think I support the aim, but not the current wording.

649
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,680
There is an amendment to allow supporting members basically to come to online business meetings.

650
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,460
Because for a societal, you can't do that.

651
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,020
If you're a WUSFERS member or supporting member or whatever we're calling it,

652
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,760
you have to buy a virtual membership to go to the virtual business meeting.

653
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,240
But you could change that so that people with WUSFERS memberships get to go to the business meeting,

654
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,080
which does seem kind of reasonable.

655
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,160
If you've bought a WUSFERS membership, you get to go to the WUSFERS meeting.

656
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,740
Yeah.

657
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,580
I think the way it is worded, unfortunately, is a little bit contradictory to other bits of the

658
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,260
constitution and we have overcomplicated the wording.

659
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,840
But otherwise, I think I'm generally in favour of this.

660
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:35,580
I think this is another, it turns out to be difficult in practice because if you're running

661
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:41,480
your business meeting virtually and then you have to have a special category that where people

662
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,480
don't in general have access to the virtual programme, but they do have access to this one

663
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,880
thing, it doesn't seem impossible.

664
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,220
No, especially not since the business meeting is running on a totally different platform, right?

665
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,560
Oh, is it not running on the platform that's just going to be the platform for the Worldcon

666
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,100
generally?

667
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,140
Have I missed a memo?

668
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,820
So it's running on this Lumi platform, which I think is for running meetings.

669
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,780
I don't think that is how they're running the entire virtual thing, but I could be wrong.

670
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,380
That's right.

671
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,100
No, you're right.

672
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,580
Yeah.

673
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,520
So I think in theory, if you have a virtual business meeting and it's running on a different

674
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,100
platform, if you're going to gate anyway, then you can gate in the supporting members

675
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,920
or WUSFERS members.

676
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,520
Yeah.

677
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,760
It makes a lot of sense, I think.

678
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,280
What's next on the agenda?

679
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,260
The next agenda, by the way, is that we are, we did ratify, we moved something last year

680
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,320
and are ratifying it this year to flip back from WUSFERS membership to supporting membership

681
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,660
again, which will probably help my brain.

682
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,920
Yes, I think it makes sense.

683
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:42,340
And I don't know whether it means that the one you mentioned about fixing it so that WUSFERS

684
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,800
members can attend WUSFERS meetings.

685
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,700
Do you think that's less likely to pass if we're going to stop calling WUSFERS members

686
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,340
WUSFERS members?

687
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,220
No, but I think you need to tie up the language anyway.

688
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:51,980
That's fair.

689
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,920
I think that is reasonable.

690
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,940
There are a bunch of amendments which sort of clarify that the constitution matches how

691
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:06,820
Hugo administration is actually working, moved by Nicholas White and Tammy Coxon, who are

692
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:14,300
basically all the Hugo administrators since about 2018 that we still want to listen to.

693
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:14,820
Yeah.

694
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,440
All seem sensible.

695
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,860
I'm not going to go into those in detail because if I went to these in detail, you're here for

696
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,440
three hours.

697
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
That's for the special Patreon.

698
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:29,520
I think the other thing to say is there is an amendment F22, end the false binary, which

699
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,560
gives you no idea that it is actually about the art categories.

700
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,240
Well, what else could it be about?

701
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,880
What other binaries have been in the news lately, Liz?

702
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,060
And it does say, yeah, this is only if the other one cleaning up the art categories, if

703
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,360
that doesn't, if that gets rejected, then we look at this one.

704
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,100
And this would change it.

705
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,780
So instead of best pro artist and best fan artist, we would have best artist in the field

706
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,160
of professional illustration and best fan artist.

707
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:00,160
And basically define artist in the field of professional illustration as someone whose work

708
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,940
has appeared in a professional publication.

709
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,880
And then we can use a professional publication definition elsewhere in the Constitution.

710
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Yes, I'm going to note that this doesn't solve the problem that Tammy raised, which is that

711
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,760
the people arguing for change here, one of the groups arguing for change here is people who

712
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,640
make a lot of who make their living through their art, but through do it in things in forms

713
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,700
that don't count as publication, like, say, personal commissions.

714
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,960
Yeah, you might have to add something like an artist whose work was in a professional publication,

715
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,220
or you could say if they deemed themselves to be professional, meaning they make more than

716
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,200
a quarter of their income from art or something like that.

717
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,800
And deem themselves professional in the way that we've got for semi-prose.

718
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,560
Possible.

719
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,020
And then that's complicated.

720
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,060
I mean, because obviously we have a longstanding tradition of professional artists who do fan art.

721
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,100
Yes, and also I don't know if I wish to nominate an artist how much money they make from their

722
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,580
art, but I do know what publications their art bid in.

723
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,980
Yes, that is in large part the problem.

724
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,980
Yeah, I think I'm going to leave people who know more about art and the issues with it to

725
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,220
wrangle over that one.

726
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,480
It's a mess.

727
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,860
I feel like the fact that we've got these things here just means we haven't sorted out

728
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,400
the mess yet.

729
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,260
We need to go away and sort it out hard.

730
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,340
Now, I don't think it's an impossible problem.

731
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,440
I just don't think we've thought it.

732
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,520
I don't think we thought about it hard enough yet.

733
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,620
You know, I don't think this is somewhere where there isn't anything that will satisfy

734
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,140
a majority of WSFUS members.

735
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,680
I think we can find something that will work for nearly everybody.

736
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,380
We just need to think hard about what that might look like.

737
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:40,120
Yeah, the problem is that what that's normally looked like for WSFUS is sending it to a committee.

738
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:46,340
So I think it's also worth saying that there were several committees formed last year and

739
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,180
most of them have reported back to this year's business meeting.

740
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,240
This isn't necessarily something you take for granted, is it?

741
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,300
Sometimes they don't.

742
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:59,400
No, well, I mean, stuff gets in the way and also the deadline this year was like a month

743
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,100
and a bit earlier.

744
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,820
Yeah.

745
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,940
So you can see that it could be tricky.

746
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,680
And, you know, stuff has been going on.

747
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,700
So there's various committee reports and I encourage you to have a read over them.

748
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,500
But there is, as we said, the investigative committee one, which will be an investigative

749
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,180
session.

750
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,520
Sorry, an executive session.

751
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:21,720
There's a software committee who have come up with some, I think, fairly sensible proposals

752
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,020
for Hugo software.

753
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:28,460
It's got to have an open source license so you can go and look at the code, which seems quite

754
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:28,740
sensible.

755
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,400
Yep.

756
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,280
That makes a lot of sense.

757
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:30,880
Yep.

758
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,080
And then there is, so they've done a nice, they've done a short report and two proposals,

759
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,880
which I enjoy.

760
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,460
The location committee have put some notes in, but basically didn't finish their deliberations.

761
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,340
So I assume they'll have to be continued to report back next year.

762
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,860
And there is a long report from the Hugo Administration Process Committee thinking about different

763
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:59,800
ways in which we could run the Hugo process to address a lot of the concerns people had

764
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,400
after 2023.

765
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:09,540
And so they have conclusions and have recommended a bunch of stuff about Hugo Administration to

766
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,240
the business meeting.

767
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,420
And there's also the business meeting study group, as covered a bit earlier, because one

768
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,820
of the committee working groups, whatever you call them, one of the working group chairs was

769
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,080
John and they have come up with a proposal.

770
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,540
So there's quite a lot of this.

771
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:25,340
I mean, there's about 30 pages of reports, I think, to read, but they are pretty interesting

772
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,420
and maybe we'll dig into them more at a later date, possibly after we've heard some business

773
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,760
meeting discussion on them.

774
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,420
The working group that I was chair of sort of has submitted a report to this.

775
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:42,820
We're not ready to submit a proposal, partly because I think we probably could have pushed

776
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:48,400
ourselves to write something that would be voted on, but I don't think that's wise, because

777
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:55,060
I think what we're proposing is quite a long way outside how things have been done previously.

778
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:00,700
And I think it's probably better to introduce it in slow stages and to seek consultation and

779
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,120
whatnot.

780
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,740
But you can go and read that.

781
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:09,940
But the effective idea is here is how we think asynchronous method for resolving business could

782
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,300
work.

783
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:17,920
Here is what we think the obvious problems we'd need to consider in any solution.

784
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,520
Like basically, before we put anything in, we need to work out what the answers to these

785
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,320
questions are and we've identified the questions, but we haven't yet identified the answers.

786
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:34,740
And then a proposal that we could run this as a trial on, for instance, the ratifications

787
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:41,820
of extended Hugo eligibility in a future year, because that's the sort of thing where, you

788
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,800
know, that's a relatively safe test bed.

789
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:49,600
And when the report from any committee came back, it could be voted on by the business meeting.

790
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,380
So there'd be a sort of safety valve if it ended up not working for any reason.

791
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,140
So yeah, that's basically what the report says.

792
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:01,100
I want the committee, if this did go out to something to do a test run, I think it should

793
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,980
be called the Committee for Asynchronous Techniques and Solutions, because then you could say that

794
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,960
you were herding cats.

795
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:12,400
And I thank John, who has been sitting on that joke for quite a long time during this recording.

796
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,780
I'd like to thank my co-hosts for not both immediately leaving the call.

797
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,400
We're just long suffering.

798
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,360
And I have one last thing I want to point out.

799
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:29,200
So there is a report from the Mark Protection Committee for the Protection of Marks.

800
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,200
And they report back that one issue, probably the biggest issue we dealt with this year,

801
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,100
was negotiating with Warner Brothers Studios for the use of fictitious Hugo Awards to be

802
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:42,480
used in the background of a new film, current working title Ghostwriter, directed by J.J.

803
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:42,900
Abrams.

804
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,500
So J.J.

805
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,660
Abrams, I think we don't know very much about his new film.

806
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,100
I think we knew it had a science fiction author in, but that science fiction author apparently

807
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,140
will have Hugo Awards.

808
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,240
And yeah, it says they had to ensure that the word replica appears in any such Hugo Award

809
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,620
props.

810
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,540
I don't know.

811
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:01,000
I don't feel super strongly about this, but I guess the Mark Protection Committee are there

812
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,300
for that.

813
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,540
I don't think anyone's going to make a fake Hugo for Warner Brothers and then Warner Brothers

814
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,860
are going to eBay it, but possibly.

815
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,300
It says they had originally requested original rockets to appear in the film, but they were unable

816
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,860
to obtain any for the years they wanted.

817
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,400
So that's interesting.

818
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,920
It is interesting, isn't it?

819
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,680
I assume it means that the years they wanted were quite a long way in the past, but I don't

820
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,000
know.

821
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,140
That is speculation, listeners.

822
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:29,120
Yeah, I'm quite interested to see if we have found anything out about what is described

823
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,220
on the internet in various places as J.J.

824
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,380
Abrams' mystery movie, J.J.

825
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,880
Abrams' untitled film.

826
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,420
So maybe we got the scoop.

827
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:44,700
The scoop was hiding in the business meeting agenda all along.

828
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,280
On page 147 of the business meeting agenda.

829
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,600
Maybe that will be something.

830
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,420
Maybe that will be a plot device in the movie.

831
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,860
Maybe it's all very meta.

832
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,720
I've tried looking for information.

833
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,440
It doesn't look like it was known that it was called Ghostwriter, but I just found a big

834
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,300
page of road closures in Glasgow for when they were filming.

835
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,320
Ah, so it could well be...

836
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,900
It could be set at the time of a Glasgow Worldcon, perhaps.

837
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:15,960
My bet is that Samuel L. Jackson is going to turn out to be a science fiction writer, and

838
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,780
something from his book is going to come true.

839
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,340
There we go.

840
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,000
Oh.

841
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,800
Oh, that'd be good.

842
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,880
I'm up for that.

843
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:27,280
That's why Liz, if we ever sell the rights to Octthorpe, Liz is in charge of the story

844
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:27,620
treatment.

845
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,960
Who's going to play you, John?

846
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,740
I mean, probably Daniel Radcliffe.

847
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:37,740
Like, that's flattering to me, but I can't think of anyone who'd do a better job.

848
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,200
That'd be pretty good, actually.

849
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,420
It's pretty solid.

850
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,240
That is solid.

851
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,860
I'm also going to say that I'm disappointed to find that they report all the page views

852
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:50,520
for the Hugo Awards by country, and I've not managed to get Thailand even into top 10, even

853
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,560
given how many times I've clicked on Hugo Awards stats in the past year.

854
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,460
So I will try harder.

855
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,720
That is...

856
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,540
I'm sorry, Liz.

857
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,340
I'm sorry you haven't made it onto that list.

858
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,280
I have faith in you in the future.

859
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,120
I only have to open the page 7,180 times.

860
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,880
All right.

861
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,580
Is that all we've got on the Worcester's business meeting?

862
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,060
Yeah.

863
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,260
Nice.

864
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,280
That was good.

865
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,340
That's interesting.

866
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,860
There's probably a lot of stuff I have missed.

867
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:26,360
If any of our listeners have read all 146 pages of the agenda and want to point out something

868
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,300
we missed, then you still have time, I think.

869
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,940
You still have time to point something out that will be in the third or fourth or fifth

870
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,000
day of the business meeting, but not the first or second.

871
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,060
So if it's the preliminary or the first slot of the main, they've missed it.

872
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:41,980
Yeah.

873
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,580
Okay.

874
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,580
That's fair.

875
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,080
Well, thank you very much, Liz, for your diligent and thorough reporting.

876
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,080
It's like Christmas.

877
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:56,180
All right.

878
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,120
Shall we do picks?

879
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,500
I don't have a pick.

880
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,360
So can we skip it?

881
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,040
No.

882
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,280
You must pick.

883
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,640
Okay.

884
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,000
I have a little pick this time.

885
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,840
Sort of.

886
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,220
Because I am still playing blueprints in every spare waking moment.

887
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,180
It's not that long since we recorded last time.

888
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:11,980
No, it isn't.

889
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,100
I have seven of everything now, Liz.

890
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,280
Is that...

891
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,540
Do you need seven of everything?

892
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,040
Is that not overkill?

893
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,360
No, you need eight.

894
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,400
Eight sigils.

895
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,940
Eight sanctum keys.

896
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,580
Eight safes.

897
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,380
Oh, dear.

898
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,160
I have seven of everything.

899
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,940
And I started kind of not looking things up exactly, but hanging out in places where hints

900
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,280
happen.

901
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,320
Okay.

902
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,460
Like in game or in the internet?

903
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,260
No, no, no.

904
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:36,660
On the internet.

905
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,220
Ah.

906
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,200
Okay.

907
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:38,940
That makes sense.

908
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:39,480
Oh, yeah.

909
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,960
There's a good Reddit post, which is like, have you...

910
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,200
Are you working on this thing?

911
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,520
And then you click for like a hint and then another hint and then it tells you.

912
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:46,820
So.

913
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,400
Cool.

914
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,220
So what's your tiny pick, Alison?

915
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,300
Yeah.

916
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,800
No, I'm going to pick A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare.

917
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,420
Specifically the Bridge Theatre production of it, which you can see for the next few weeks,

918
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:58,740
I guess.

919
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,400
Plus they were saying, oh, we're filming it.

920
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,980
So maybe they'll release some sort of online access to it at some point.

921
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:10,140
This is a rework of the 2019 production, which I did not see.

922
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,700
Apparently people saw it in lockdown, but I think I must have been busy whenever it was

923
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,180
streamed.

924
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,720
I'm not sure busy doing what, but there we go.

925
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:24,140
So, but we saw it and it, they've kind of done some gender swapping, but not a huge amount.

926
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,800
It's a rather silly play.

927
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,080
It's a very lighthearted production.

928
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:34,780
There's a lot of people doing trapeze work and beds floating in the sky and things of that

929
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,100
kind.

930
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,420
And I thought it was very good and very funny.

931
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:43,140
I'm not hugely enamored of all the kind of modern ad-libbing, but you know, obviously people

932
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:43,700
quite like it.

933
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,380
It makes it, it makes the play more comprehensible to people.

934
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,980
I wasn't, we had seats this time and we weren't, last time I went to the bridge, it was immersive.

935
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,020
I was one of the immersive people who got to stand in the middle and wander around.

936
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:58,040
But this time we just got to sit back and watch everybody else doing that.

937
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,500
I enjoyed it a lot.

938
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:05,020
So yeah, it's, and the weather's quite hot now and kind of, it's quite a good time to

939
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:09,220
go to see a Midsummer Night's Dream because it feels like it's the sort of thing that, that

940
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,960
should happen in gloriously hot weather.

941
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,840
No, that's fair.

942
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,200
Last time I saw it, it was outside at, in Walthamstow.

943
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,740
And I quite like seeing Shakespeare outside in the summer as well, but there is a definite

944
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,740
advantage if you're going to do a stage of play where a lot of people are flying around

945
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,400
on trapezes, well, hammocky type things.

946
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:31,440
You probably do want to do that indoors on account of you have something to fix all the,

947
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,040
all the aerial things too.

948
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,620
Yeah.

949
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:41,420
I went to see Midsummer Night's Dream outside in Tollthorpe, which is near Stamford in Lincolnshire.

950
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,120
And it was very good.

951
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,120
The bottom in particular was very good.

952
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,640
I think a good bottom can make or break a Midsummer Night's Dream.

953
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,420
I think that is right.

954
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:55,100
And in particular, the gender swapping in this one has, has Oberon seducing bottom rather

955
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:55,700
than Titania.

956
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:02,720
I don't think that's a huge spoiler, which made them have lots of jokes about, put more

957
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,340
emphasis on the jokes about Oberon fancying a nice bit of ass.

958
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:12,140
A sort of, a sort of joke, you see.

959
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,040
No, that's quite good.

960
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,420
Yeah.

961
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:18,060
Well, I mean, it can be quite hard to spot the jokes in a Midsummer Night's Dream if you're

962
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,280
not, if you don't work very hard at it as a, as a production.

963
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,220
I've certainly seen it be quite unfunny.

964
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,040
Oh, yes.

965
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:29,260
The one of the key, one of the, maybe not, maybe, I don't know whether it's fair to put

966
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,940
this on Shakespeare, but I think badly put on Shakespeare is responsible for a lot of my

967
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,460
early dislike of Shakespeare.

968
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,460
And it wasn't until I saw it well done that I was like, oh, hang on a minute.

969
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,080
It's full of jokes.

970
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,680
It's full of knob jokes.

971
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,460
Who knew?

972
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,880
If you actually sort of produce it in a way that brings the humour out, it's quite good.

973
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,860
But you actually do have to do that.

974
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,960
I know, I know, I know many people listening are already aware.

975
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,220
Sorry to everyone who already knows such things.

976
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,060
Well, I think it's easy.

977
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,540
It's easier to know those things now because both there are, I think, a lot, there are a

978
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:04,920
lot of good productions around, a lot of which are accessible and a lot of them are available

979
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,720
through, you know, streaming and television performance and things.

980
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,400
And you can actually learn that in a way that I'm not sure it was so easy to do when I was

981
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:12,720
a kid.

982
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,160
Certainly.

983
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,520
I saw some absolutely dismal Shakespeare productions.

984
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,840
Yeah, that's fair.

985
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,820
That makes sense.

986
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,020
Liz, have you had time to come up with a pick yet?

987
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,880
Yes, fine.

988
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,500
I came up with a pick.

989
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,360
Hey!

990
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,980
Because I haven't read anything new since the last time we recorded, I'm going back for

991
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,620
something I read a few weeks ago.

992
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,060
And so maybe this will be slightly vaguer than usual.

993
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:38,300
But I'm going to go for Old Soul by Susan Barker, which is, well, there's a literary horror

994
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:38,660
novel.

995
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,540
I mean, it's a horror novel.

996
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,300
It's not that literary.

997
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:47,220
It's about basically two strangers meet and discover that they both have lost people they

998
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,720
loved who before they died crossed paths with a mystery woman.

999
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,820
And basically it's about one of these characters following all these threads and you get all

1000
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,940
these mini stories within a story of all the people who have crossed paths with this woman

1001
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:06,880
over the years and died soon afterwards because this is, you know, it's a vampire story, basically.

1002
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,860
What?

1003
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:08,840
No.

1004
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:16,080
And then there is like one person who knows this vampire better than anyone else.

1005
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,380
And yeah, I enjoyed it.

1006
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:23,740
I quite like this whole sort of like story within a story idea.

1007
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:28,240
And I felt like they were pleasingly different and crossed a bunch of different countries and

1008
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:28,880
settings.

1009
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,680
And yeah, I got very drawn in and enjoyed reading it.

1010
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,760
So I recommend that.

1011
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,540
Nice.

1012
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,700
That sounds good.

1013
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:39,280
Not doing anything incredibly new, I would say, but it does it pretty well.

1014
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,880
It does have that thing where none of the dialogue has quote marks around it, which I could see

1015
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,600
could be really irritating if you're someone who would find that really irritating.

1016
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,280
So be warned.

1017
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:54,280
One of the Clark finalists had that trait.

1018
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,860
And I did see discourse on the internet about it.

1019
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,620
Hmm.

1020
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,520
All right.

1021
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:07,300
So in keeping with previous episodes, I'm going to pick a book and I'm going to pick We Are

1022
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,060
All Ghosts in the Forest by Lorraine Wilson.

1023
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,140
This is interesting.

1024
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,180
This is interesting.

1025
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,080
I don't know if it's fantasy or science fiction.

1026
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,700
I have heard persuasive arguments on both sides of that debate.

1027
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,900
I think it might be some sort of an unholy blend of both.

1028
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:39,580
We follow a character called Katarina, who is effectively a witch doctor and beekeeper who keeps herself to herself and can whip you up a mean remedy.

1029
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:48,240
And everyone in the village that she lives in is extremely suspicious of her, despite the fact that without her, they would all be completely lost.

1030
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:55,160
And she meets a small child and they go on an adventure.

1031
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,160
And hilarity ensues.

1032
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,880
And I really enjoyed it.

1033
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,200
I particularly like...

1034
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,480
I think I fall more on the side of this being fantasy than science fiction.

1035
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,960
But I very much enjoyed the way it kind of blends the two.

1036
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:22,800
It's set in this kind of post-apocalyptic world where data has kind of become fragmented and you get these ghosts made of data.

1037
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:28,300
And you have to be very careful about kind of interacting with them because they can be very dangerous.

1038
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,900
And that I think is a good idea that was implemented well.

1039
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,920
And I, like I say, enjoyed it quite thoroughly.

1040
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,600
So yeah, I would highly recommend people check it out.

1041
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,120
And I like the characterization.

1042
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:47,000
And as another book, long-time listeners will know that it made me angry in a good way.

1043
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,360
And I very much like it when a book does that.

1044
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:57,560
The author, Lorraine Wilson, has a new book coming out, which I'm also very excited about, which is called The Salt Oracle.

1045
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,500
And it's coming out from Simon & Schuster.

1046
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,280
And it will be published at some point.

1047
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,940
The 6th of November, apparently.

1048
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:13,060
I think it might be in the same universe, but I don't think it is the same characters.

1049
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:18,540
And so it's going to be another interesting blend of science fiction and fantasy, which I am looking forward to reading.

1050
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:19,180
All right.

1051
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:19,840
Sounds good.

1052
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,100
Did we do the end of the podcast?

1053
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,780
That was The Octothorpe Podcast.

1054
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,160
And it's goodbye from me.

1055
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,540
It's goodbye from me.

1056
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,000
And it's goodbye from me.

1057
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:52,460
I am going on holiday and I have to read some books.

1058
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,800
I think when I'm on holiday, I should be reading more.

1059
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,180
That's fair.

1060
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,080
Holidays are a good time to read things.

1061
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,020
Anything in particular you're going to read?

1062
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:03,600
Well, all the things you guys will be recommending for the last six months.

1063
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,860
Yeah, but then you won't be able to pick them because we already picked them.

1064
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:06,760
Oh, that's true.

1065
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:11,380
I don't think Alison's reading should be entirely focused around picks for the podcast.

1066
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:15,180
Maybe like, you know, 20% focused around that.

1067
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:15,640
Yeah.

1068
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,460
Well, I mean, at the moment, I quite like it to be focused on actually doing some reading.

1069
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,360
Can you guys hear me?

1070
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,500
Because I think my...

1071
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,460
Yes, but you're a bit choppy.

1072
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,000
I plugged my computer in.

1073
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,380
This is what happened last time.

1074
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,360
I plugged my computer in and Zoom went choppy.

1075
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,920
I do not understand.

1076
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,220
What happens if you plug your computer in before we start?

1077
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:40,460
Well, I mean, I don't plug my computer in before we start because I bring it up and use it on battery power

1078
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:44,660
because I believe there's a risk of interference with the microphone cable.

1079
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:48,120
But if we go on for a bit long, which we have done at this time...

1080
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,260
I'm recording on an iMac and I've not had any problem.

1081
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:51,980
Yes.

1082
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:53,540
Well, OK, we had problems once.

1083
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:54,100
True.

1084
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:54,800
That's true.

1085
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,200
It is unusual for me to have a washing machine delivered.

1086
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:58,780
Yeah.

1087
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,560
So normally we have...

1088
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
Normally I have enough time.

1089
