00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
 Let's not get sidetracked into a discussion of lamination.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:22,560
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 118th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for Science Fiction

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,280
 and Science Fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 12th of September 2024. I'm John Coxon,

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,280
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. We don't have letters of comments today, listeners,

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,280
 we are going to do a bumper mailbag next episode and we will be going through about two months of

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,320
 letters. So if you have things you would like to tell us please write in, we promise we will

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,360
 have read them before the next episode. And we'll include as many as we can. So just to start

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,280
 discussing our second Glasgow episode, there's a lot of Glasgow. We forgot to mention last time

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,440
 there is a Worldcon photos album on Flickr, there will be a link in the show notes and this is

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,080
 photographs by a team of people. So there are photos by Paul Weemer, Olav Rockne, Simon Bubb

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,520
 and Dan Other and those are just the ones I know about. I think there's also some photos from Michael

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,520
 Ben-Viniste in there. Amanda Wacka-Raku is not actually behind the camera but was actually doing a ton

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,960
 of the support for Olav as well. Yes, true true true. And so yes, we will link in the show notes but

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,000
 if you want photos of the Worldcon, there are some there. I've been very much like how basically

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,880
 older photographers at the Hugo seem to be Hugo nominees and thank you very much to Olav and Amanda

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,200
 for giving up some of their time when they could be wandering around drinking wine to take nice photos

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,240
 everyone on a very phototopable backdrop. We will put some art in the show notes. Andrew Hogg noted

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,200
 fan artist inventor of the comic strip, fanboys has done some reorganizations of the photographs

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,080
 with various backgrounds and I will try and put together an online album of them and put them in

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,600
 the show notes because they are quite wonderful listeners. When I saw the photos I was like oh

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,440
 other people went and got lovely photos taken with Plus One and I should really have done that.

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,960
 Sorry Stephen. I also did not do that. I felt like that was a mistake. There's a very good picture on

23
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,480
 friend of the podcast Andy's Blue Sky where it's the three of us and Andy and Andy's holding my

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,440
 Hugo and so it looks like I am the hanger on next to a Hugo Award winning podcast which I did enjoy.

25
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,680
 Oh that was in the bar wasn't it? Yes. Yeah yeah I'll put it in show notes.

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,160
 We discussed a variety of things about Worldcon last episode. We discussed registration and the

27
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,200
 hugos and a little bit of the business meeting and the program and today we're going to be focusing

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,120
 on Hall 4 to start off and we're going to start with meetups. Hall 4 is big. Very big.

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
 You might think it's a long way from the Crown Plaza to the business meeting but that's just

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,920
 peanuts to Hall 4. Look I guess we should say this is actually we're talking about Hall 4 and 5 I

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,640
 guess because we'll talk about the dealers as well. Hall 4 was sort of exhibits, fan tables,

32
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,920
 the fanzine lounge and bits like that and I also had the food tracks and also had the parties in it

33
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:25,760
 and then Hall 5 was dealers and the art show. This is the AD&D division of the convention.

34
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,400
 Yes. Did you guys ever have to go to the stationary supply office? Consupplies. What's that Glasgow?

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,320
 Yeah. No I wish I had but I didn't please tell us. So I went hunting for something for

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,080
 program ops on Thursday morning and I was looking for like consupplies office and I went and asked

37
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,960
 Phil Dyson and Phil was like oh okay wait I'll show you and he basically had to lead me to it by

38
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,960
 the hand because you went all the way back to the back of Hall 4 to an unmarked door that looked

39
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,400
 like a staff only one and then through another set of doors and there was like a little office

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,040
 that was full of like stationary and things and but yeah it was basically so far away from everything.

41
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,360
 I'm now sad I missed out on what sounds like the best program I am that was available at the

42
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,760
 convention which is just a room full of stationary. It was but it was it was mostly empty by the

43
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,720
 time I got there and also like 2,000 steps in search of a thing. I will also say I just want to make

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,680
 it very clear that that is a reflection of how much I love stationary and not a reflection on the

45
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,600
 quality of the Glasgow 2024 program which was excellent. There were no laminators John.

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,880
 Ah what I've got a laminator in my house what shit pastry covered but but good really because

47
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,320
 you know laminating things for six days and then throwing them away is not the best. No no I know

48
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,080
 I know. What else was in Hall 4 other than a very well hidden stationery office? Meetups Liz,

49
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,600
 meetups and we went to the podcast to meet up and I was like hello I'm a podcaster and then Tammy

50
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,120
 came and I was like I know who Tammy is and Laurie and Kevin were there so it was fine but I was

51
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
 very shy. How did you all enjoy the podcast meetup? There were a lot of podcasters and the thing

52
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,600
 about the meetups in general is that Glasgow had I think quite optimistically put three

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,840
 backwitting tables for three meetups in the various lots that have meetups and I think the podcast

54
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,680
 meetup had about 60 or 70 podcasters. I think that was kind of normal for meetups meetups were

55
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,320
 quite big at this event a lot of the meetups were quite big at this convention and and one table

56
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,920
 of 10 people was not quite going to do they split us very arbitrarily into fiction and non-fiction

57
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,720
 podcasts which is probably the right way to go for us because most of our podcasting friends are

58
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,680
 doing non-fiction podcasts I think I'm just hoping I haven't distanced anybody terribly there.

59
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,920
 I didn't even notice who we divided oh it's just wandering around. Yeah no they divided us into

60
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,440
 fiction and non-fiction podcasts and we were in a group with other people who were doing non-fiction

61
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,400
 podcasts of podcasts about science fiction and related things rather than podcasts that are

62
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,880
 actually generating fiction either by reading it out as some podcasts do or by doing like dramatic

63
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,520
 bits and bobs but not in a best dramatic presentation way. The only fiction podcaster I think I know

64
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,760
 is Emily and Capen. Obviously there are many but that's their only escape pod. Oh well yeah okay

65
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,320
 but like the only person I'd feel that like able to like say hi to a convention I guess.

66
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,120
 I know the escape pod people I think you know. Oh well no that's true I know Alistair and

67
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,360
 Marguerite and yeah who were kindly hosting the podcast meetup which yes yes they were.

68
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,960
 It was a very you know nice thing to do. In my head Alistair is a fan writer and fans enerter

69
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,760
 and I always forget that he does a semi-prosy. When also in my head is skate pod is a semi-prosy

70
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,280
 not a fan cast so like he he brackets fan cast from both directions like a pincer movement.

71
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,040
 Yeah so so podcast the podcast meetup had had podcasts that were dramatic presentations and

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,040
 podcasts that were semi-prosy and and fan casts and all sorts of things because categories are

73
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,760
 nonsense just one you go for everything. Oh oh it could be a very big big Hugo.

74
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,440
 Best thing this this idea comes from Ian Snell his idea for a Hugo Award for Best Thing

75
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,640
 which would neatly sidestep all eligibility considerations and be reliably won each year

76
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,880
 by an episode of Doctor Who. Doctor who didn't even win it's best. Now I know I don't let facts

77
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,160
 get in the way jokes Alison. Good strategy good strategy I had numerous conversations over the

78
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,160
 weekend and since with people who think who told me that X thing should be a Hugo category and

79
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,600
 in all of those cases I'm kind of like really do you think do you think there are enough things

80
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:43,520
 for people to nominate them consistently every year and then you know not everything has to be a

81
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,280
 Hugo. So this is a digression you wanted to say things about meetups. I wanted to say things about

82
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,200
 meetups which is that I went to the podcasting meetup which was a kind of official meetup that

83
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,920
 was on the program and I also went to the fan funds delicate reception which was a meetup that was

84
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,600
 not called that but was a program item that was on the program and had enormous numbers of people

85
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,280
 at it which Joseph Dichliss said in a hushed tone surely these people cards will be fan funds

86
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,400
 delegates and I was like well the vast majority of them are in fact because it's quite a big party now

87
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,200
 and with a photo of that one and then I went to a couple of meetups that were not on the program

88
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,280
 but people just have meetups like the TWP meetup and the customs meetup which was amazing because

89
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,800
 we had sorry I should say the Cambridge University Science Future Society meetup and which in

90
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,200
 open brackets now incorporating Yumsborg which was the Cambridge University Fantasy Society

91
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,880
 which had I mean and probably about as many people as the podcast as meetup just vast numbers of

92
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 people of all ages and that was quite excited. Cambridge full of weird nerd shocker

93
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,000
 Cambridge full of weird nerd shocker indeed and one of my personal delights was discovering that

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,720
 Rosanna Pendelbury who's one of the nerds for feather people who I met at the weekend is also a

95
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,960
 cuss was chair being like me but about kind of 35 years difference so this was all quite cool

96
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,600
 and in general meetups were hugely delightful and I think there were just lots of meetups

97
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,720
 happening along lots of different axes over the weekend and it gave me a chance to meet people

98
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
 I looked back before people I hadn't had that before people who I really wanted to see at this

99
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,400
 World Cup but only actually saw at the relevant meetup and it was great and I hope everybody else

100
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,480
 also had fun of that kind. On the subject of meetups to be personally introspective it's very weird

101
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,960
 because at this calm I was probably first and foremost a podcaster and I don't really think of

102
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:44,000
 myself as much of a podcaster. Hugo award winning podcaster Liz Batty in "Don't really think of

103
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,560
 myself as a podcaster scandal" yeah but like the only program items I did were related to

104
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,840
 Octothor basically so it was clear that like I was a podcaster this time and it's a bit strange

105
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,480
 you were podcaster here wouldn't you? yes but I didn't do any of the actual podcaster program

106
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
 because I didn't think I was qualified to be on any of them very well there were the good people

107
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,000
 so yeah that that's what we call self exclusion and imposter syndrome they generally were like

108
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,720
 great people for all of them and I didn't think they'd do a great job like if you could have put

109
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,520
 me on a thing about oh how to make your podcaster the answer would be get John to do all the work

110
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,760
 and that's or you know get your brother to give you a very nice microphone thank you brother.

111
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,800
 It used to be when I was on panels I introduced myself as a fanzine editor and I might mention

112
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,320
 my day job and now when I'm on panels I start with that I do Octothor because that is like the

113
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:40,960
 thing for which I am most notable arguably in total but definitely in fandom and that is kind of odd

114
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,920
 it's kind of gratifying because I think it's neat that like we had an idea and that idea has

115
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,840
 become a thing we are known for which is really nice but it is I do tell your spoilers like when

116
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,440
 I'm like it's weird isn't it yeah well because on the panel on andro I was like I'm a podcaster

117
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,200
 my podcaster Octothorpe is a Hugo finalist and like it's like it's all true but it feels weird to

118
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,400
 mention but that is also undoubtedly why there are panels where I think I have the expertise of a

119
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,400
 fan and the eloquence of a eloquent fan and the thing that is pushing me over the edge into being

120
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,600
 the person that's asked is that I have done 116 episodes of a popular podcast.

121
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,080
 Semi popular. Semi what the fuck is that?

122
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,960
 I do think I was listening to the three black halflings and one of the people I met this

123
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,240
 weekend was their producer who is very lovely I was listening to them and the way they

124
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,280
 kick off each other and speak and thinking oh well one of the things about podcasters is that you

125
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:51,440
 would think that after you've done a certain number of podcasts your ability to sound okay on

126
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,520
 items is quite is enhanced by that experience and I'm not sure it's invariably true I think my

127
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,240
 performance on panels is better than it was though though sorry to people who saw me over the weekend

128
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,040
 at Glasgow. I didn't mention this in the program or when we were talking about replay but I was

129
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,760
 quite proud of how the Ahsoka panel went because there was me and Dan Morin who is a podcaster in

130
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,320
 the Apple Blogosphere and we were the first two to speak and we kind of set up a running

131
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,640
 joke with the other panelists picked up and went with and we kept coming back to and like it is

132
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,800
 that sort of thing where you start getting better at picking up people's balls and I'm not sure I'm

133
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,000
 I'm still not sure I'm great at it but I'm definitely a lot better at it than I was before we'd thought

134
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,720
 thought. At the podcast meetup one of the people was one of the podcasters I'd been on a panel

135
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,920
 with earlier in the weekend and I I introduced him to a wider group saying and and his podcast is

136
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,520
 great because of Exford Wild he just beamed from ear to ear and I thought oh it maybe I am learning

137
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,640
 some management training after all only 40 years too late. What are they so the cuspous meetup

138
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,040
 and the podcaster meetup and TWP which is the women's periodical which is an appa filled with

139
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,400
 women yeah an appa for women based mostly British women if you're interested in that get in touch

140
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,560
 and I'll get in touch with you and tell you how to join we should probably explain what an appa is

141
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,320
 but basically people write things and staple them together and mail them to each other and a staple

142
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,400
 is a tiny bit of metal that you can put into paper to make them stick together yeah if you're a worse

143
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,440
 real fans don't use staples and mark plumber will testify he will testify against but he will

144
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,040
 testify did you go to any meetups Liz other than podcasting no I was just a podcaster you know

145
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,360
 John that's mine identity now we mentioned appas and another example of an appa is WUF

146
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,920
 which was collated at the fanzine lounge and allesim will tell us all about it so WUF is the

147
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,040
 world con order of fanads which is an appa that is collated at WILCON you can either send a pdf in

148
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,440
 or you can come along with a load of copies and and the instant fanzine went into it which was

149
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,120
 very gratifying because i've been involved in that and the and Christina Lake put it together

150
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,680
 because she has not had Liz Batty's how to say no to allesim trading

151
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,800
 Christina i'm available i am very grateful for everyone who has not had that training

152
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,080
 so the fanzine lounge the fanzine lounge was pretty good it was run by my wife is fanny sheriff

153
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,560
 with some help from my husband yeah no it's good good place to hang out did some sort of editing

154
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,240
 there there were like neat things chris gossia's t-shirt was there um so for those who have seen

155
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:39,280
 chris gossia on stage when he won a hugo he was wearing his flint stones shirt that shirt has

156
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,960
 been retired and so he got everyone to sign it and i signed it chris's nickname for me is john the

157
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,080
 rock coxon it's a long story it's been his nickname for me for a very long time and i signed it that

158
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,680
 way because i knew he would appreciate it and then i won a hugo and he was like now you're

159
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,280
 john the rockit coxon so i had to go back and add et onto the end of rock but i did and it was fine

160
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,000
 and that was really lovely and there was dragon racing and we've discovered the way to get young

161
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,920
 fans into fanzines which is you have the dragon you have the fanzine lounge in view of the children's

162
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,720
 activities part of the fan area and then you do dragon racing and children come and they're like

163
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,760
 we want to race the dragons too please which was as fanny was very happy with so one of the

164
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,440
 other things that fell off by to-do list was that i wanted to make to have a kind of structural

165
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,200
 thing for making mini fanzines where you have a sheet of instructions showing how you make mini

166
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,080
 fanzines and you have blank mini fanzines and then you have craft items which there were in the kids

167
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:41,280
 area and then fanzines happen more or less organically if you do that and i didn't have time so boo

168
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,520
 another time but that was also deliberately designed to end up with children making fanzines

169
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,680
 ispania my wife exhibited in the art show and she sold prince and her fans and she sold

170
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,160
 most of her fans and all of her prince which is really great some of the art was amazing in the

171
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,960
 art show this year i did not get time to look at all of it which was to my great sorrow but i

172
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,200
 really thought there were a lot of great art on on display and world con art shows are one of my

173
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,160
 favorite parts of the convention i also thought it greatly benefited from not being in a completely

174
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,360
 different building a significant walk away from the rest of the convention unlike some previous

175
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,800
 european world cons yeah so having it in the middle of the dealers room was lovely for the artist it

176
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,080
 was not so lovely for the dealers who were tucked around the back um but i think all of the dealers

177
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,040
 did quite well it was a generally a color there were a lot of people who saved up a lot of money

178
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,960
 to come to world con and then wanted to spend some of it in the leaders room and that was quite good

179
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,240
 our fan funds tables got moved from fan tables into dealers room where we said we cannot secure

180
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,960
 these tables for all of the hours in which hall four is open um because we got we had a lot of

181
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,080
 quite valuable stuff knocking around the fan funds tables and people kept donating stuff and so on

182
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,400
 and they moved us into the dealers room thank you thank you Glasgow that was very very kind of

183
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:07,360
 the overall amount raised for the fan funds was a shade over 6,700 pounds which is a lot of money

184
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,840
 and we are very grateful to everybody who donated things and all the people who helped out i have a

185
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,440
 list of 36 people who materially physically helped with the the business of doing the work the fan

186
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,600
 funds at the world con which quite a lot it was good i bought a anthology of fan writing by Randy

187
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,480
 Byers who who i miss very much it's going to be really weird to have us here at World con where

188
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,240
 Randy isn't there and that moves us on to the in memoriam section of hall four which was right

189
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,240
 in the very middle the the little bit that the fan lounge was in was in the sort of calm middle area

190
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,360
 of the of hall four um with kind of exhibits and food and all of the other stuff around it and um

191
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 right in the very middle was a tree and a memorial garden and the kind of memorial scroll i there's a

192
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,520
 there's a link to that on the internet which we should link to and i'd go and look at it kind of

193
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,320
 quietly and peacefully not in the memorial garden but in my hotel room at some point because i

194
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,080
 knew i would have a little gripe which i did and it's quite nice doing that in my hotel room rather

195
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,800
 than say at a ceremony where i feel blobby especially not in the middle of the hugos imagine if that

196
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,800
 had been kind of immediately before or immediately after we had won a hugo that would be really

197
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,920
 weird i'd have to go up go up and get the hugo or puffy faced so i quite liked having it dotted the

198
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,120
 hugos thank you i'm torn did they did they put it in the opening ceremony which i didn't go to

199
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,840
 they did right at the end apparently okay i confess i had to leave the opening ceremony early on account

200
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:48,160
 of how it went long and i had to be in a different place so i missed it but i heard reports that it

201
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,760
 was and i haven't checked was that our place was that the fanfans yes it was the reception yeah i

202
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,000
 think it's nice to have like a big public thing where we show the memorial scroll but yeah i agree

203
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,320
 that it works for most people in the hugos but maybe not the people who might after then be

204
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,360
 composing up on stage shortly after also i find it harder every year and i don't think i'm alone in

205
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,480
 that that it's gone from oh there would be one or two names where i'm like oh this is hard to to

206
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,640
 oh goodness it's not clear to me if that's an age thing or a network thing because like obviously

207
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,440
 as you know more the longer i go to conventions the more people i know and then the more people

208
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,680
 there are who might go but i remember my very first immemorium had someone that i'd met on my

209
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,480
 taftrip who was younger than me on it so it never gets easy and actually writing my taff report 10

210
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,000
 years late was quite hard in places because when you're writing about like oh i went to this place

211
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,280
 with these two people and they are both no longer with this is like oh okay like stu shiftman and vj

212
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:56,800
 bowin and and a lot of Seattle fans i met yeah no indeed right sorry but then capitalism happened

213
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,200
 and that made everything better let's talk about dealers there was places that sold games and that

214
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,840
 was great and also i got to know a couple of the dealers quite well because i ran the scavenger hunt

215
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,120
 on discord which we'll talk about later but a few dealers submitted prizes to that which we were

216
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,320
 very grateful for um so thank you to everyone who did two of the stalls i was particularly attracted

217
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,160
 to were mati makes and beyond cataclysm and beyond cataclysm were also at east con but at this

218
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,880
 convention every time i had groats i went to spend them at the beyond cataclysm table and i got some

219
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,480
 good swag and if you are on instagram i will put a link to my swag in the show notes i like the

220
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,520
 dealers room i didn't buy a lot i will say i find it increasingly tricky in the dealers room when

221
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,800
 there are a lot of like self-published authors who have a table because then i feel a bit bad about

222
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,960
 just wandering past and like ignoring their efforts to get me to talk to them because i

223
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,400
 generally am not going to buy any i'm probably only going to buy books in the dealers room because

224
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,320
 i've already heard about them i'm probably not going to be persuaded to buy your book just from

225
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,520
 talking to you so i just liked it more when there were more like general booksellers but i did like

226
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,800
 boner books who are published and had big tentacles for their book i got a ribbon that said experts

227
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:19,920
 in edging i also got this a ribbon this was the only corporate ribbon i think from illumicrate.com

228
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,120
 and they sell books with beautiful painted edges and i saw the ribbon and i was like i must have that

229
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,720
 on my ribbon beard and then i did all of the ribbons i had with ones that convention gave me

230
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,040
 or ones that my mates gave me um and even at that i had to stop because i'd have fallen over and

231
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,440
 tripped over on my ribbon and that would have been terrible but but that was the one that i made

232
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,720
 an exception for because i thought it was so funny my favorite ribbon is okai sci-fi which

233
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,960
 makes me smile every time i look at it i can see it from my chair i did not get that one ah great

234
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,520
 ribbon i did get the vibrant food culture ribbon yes i got more than a hero a union man which is my

235
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,920
 favorite uh sartre quote i got vibrant food culture and i put it next to the haggis pakora ribbon haggis

236
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,760
 pakora yeah yes are you familiar with the hoo song boris the spider no yes so you can see haggis pakora

237
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:21,680
 and it scans the same so i had haggis pakora but um um in my head for like a lot of the convention

238
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,480
 and i had haggis pakora and they were good i did not have haggis pakora and i had had an

239
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,120
 intention to have haggis pakora but the food trucks in hall four did put me off fried food for life

240
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,200
 i would have been very unhappy at this convention except that about i think sometime on friday

241
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,920
 somebody told me that you could get a perfectly nice baguette with food in it from the deli on the

242
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,560
 concourse and i ate those for lunch for the rest of the weekend weekend and it was all right because

243
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,400
 they felt like food to me whereas the most of the stuff in hall four triggered my there are too many

244
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,000
 carbohydrates and not enough other macronutrients in this food so they were like that like the geros

245
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,920
 which is normally a very safe thing for me was like um meat and bread and salad which is something

246
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,400
 i eat a lot of and also chips but why would you do that because the only food they were doing

247
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:20,560
 the things you get out of a big frozen bag and deep fry i had a lot of good food in nearby

248
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,280
 our guile street which is very lovely including on the monday night we found a place we found at

249
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,880
 satellite again and i had lovely scottish beers and lovely lovely burger and it was yummy so so

250
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,040
 actually next next world come we're all that can make a plan to go out to the together i know

251
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,040
 we did in chicago but we didn't this time that was a mistake i mean i didn't go out for dinner very

252
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,200
 much at all though because i mean our guile street was great but it was like you know you are out of

253
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,160
 the con for two or three hours i could only get there by cab and i couldn't and there weren't

254
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,640
 there weren't enough cabs so yeah yeah and i was a bit disappointed that having looked up on google

255
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,000
 the menu for the the clide built restaurant in the concourse which looked pretty good when i went

256
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
 check the actual restaurant it was smaller and totally different and a lot more fried and shut

257
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,440
 at seven p.m or something that there there weren't there wasn't food on most of the times we looked

258
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,720
 we found a very nice indian that is only a few minutes walk from the scc called india key and

259
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,240
 it's probably not as good as indians on our guile street because lasko has some of the best

260
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,440
 indian food in the country but it was fantastic for somebody who come and walk very far so it was

261
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,160
 absolutely lovely and then we actually went out with lillian one night well props to lillian for

262
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,040
 arranging being the one person who arranged dinner with me in advance and that was great that was to

263
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,360
 belgid restaurant called brel where i had um in complete defiance of this theory that i like um

264
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,960
 that i wanted something healthy i had mac and cheese and it was fantastic i do want it on the record

265
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,920
 that i did post about dinner we were going to and you were like i'm in the bar and didn't come so like

266
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:00,080
 it wasn't entirely that there was no option but yeah but it would have been like three quarters

267
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,440
 and half for me to get to wherever you were i think the problem is with this is that as i think

268
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,480
 again taste but i'd much rather go off site what i've tried to do more and more at world cons is

269
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,520
 consider people who i would like to see and actually have proper experiences with and then

270
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,480
 make the time to do that because i think it's very easy for me at a convention owing to i mean

271
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,800
 owing to fadav ADHD and there's a lot happening to just ping pong around everyone and be like oh

272
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,200
 i'll catch up with you later it was great to see you and then never actually do the catching up later

273
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,360
 and so what i was trying to do was go off site with people where i would like to spend two or three

274
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,920
 hours just with them and to be to live in that and not to get foam mode that there were other

275
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,320
 people i could be having more fun with so like we went out with mark claire on one of the nights

276
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,240
 and it was just the four of us obviously like mark and claire great and then like i got with

277
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,560
 going out for beers and pizzas on like the when's the old thursday night i can't remember

278
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,320
 was really good but then obviously there are times when it's just like now i just got to get

279
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,240
 something at the camp last because i really don't have two hours to spare but and it's hard because

280
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,200
 like i say there's a lot happening at worldcon should we talk about parties there were some

281
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,680
 i had whiskey and japanese gin the japanese party was really good they had japanese alcohols and

282
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,640
 they were all very nice and like you know you weren't getting huge servings but it was just lovely to

283
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,280
 sort of sample different things and i remember one of my favorite memories in my first east

284
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:43,200
 com was there was a party for anticipation which was the montreal 2009 worldcom i remember very

285
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,920
 fondly they had maple rum and i that is my favorite one of my nicest memories of that convention is

286
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,440
 like drinking maple rum at their party and i love sampling weird alcohols from around the world

287
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,960
 so yeah i know it was it was cool there was like a good mix of different bids there

288
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,360
 sort of advertising and chatting and stuff what did you guys think of the parties

289
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,240
 this is one of the so some of my worldcon experience was mediated through a

290
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,840
 i am not going to do anything where i'm not going to be able sure i'm going to be able to sit

291
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,880
 out and i thought that i would probably because if i went to the bar i could hang out in the bar

292
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,200
 with people and if i went to the parties i thought that there was quite a high risk i would be

293
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,080
 unable to sit down with people i wanted to talk to and in fact there were a few times in the bar

294
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,080
 when i found it difficult to sit down with people i want to talk to but in general the

295
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,280
 cramplars a bar was much better than it has been at previous not the the fan bar was fine but the

296
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:44,000
 main cramplars a bar was much better than it has been at previous clasco worldcons and was quite a

297
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,880
 good place to sit down and hang out liz what do you think of parties i didn't enjoy the party much

298
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,680
 basically because the newsletter at least for first few days there was no way of knowing what

299
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,600
 parties were on any one day like there wasn't a big board that told you what parties were on

300
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,920
 it wasn't in the newsletter so what it was was like some kind of indoor tents which were generally

301
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,960
 surrounded by an awful lot of people very close together and so it's like oh do i kind of elbow

302
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,880
 my way through this group of people to try and work out what the party is for and most of the time

303
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,320
 i didn't and it was also far enough from the fan bar and the cramplars a bar they're like you

304
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,440
 couldn't kind of flip from one to the other so i would mostly go into the bar so i felt it was a

305
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,120
 bit of a missed opportunity i think also they didn't really advertise they didn't seem to

306
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,320
 advertise the parties very much i'm not sure if people who are new to world can't even

307
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,000
 knew that they were kind of these parties going on because i want the news let's say

308
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,720
 look lots of open access parties i think that segues quite nicely into communications

309
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:51,200
 where i think there were certain things this convention did not have a newsletter it had

310
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:59,680
 powerpoint slides which were put on screens and it was not there were a screen behind the

311
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:06,400
 volunteer desk and there was a screen in the business meeting when the business meeting wasn't

312
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,680
 happening and i don't think i saw a screen with the newsletter on it at any other point during the

313
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,600
 convention there were screens in many program rooms but it'll be sec program rooms because of the

314
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,160
 whole streaming thing that you know there wasn't there weren't screens in the

315
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,760
 cramplars a program rooms i don't think yes there were and they had the newsletter on

316
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,560
 so the screen where there were screens in program rooms they had the newsletter on between items i

317
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,320
 thought that bit of it worked pretty well moving to this new process it happened quite

318
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,480
 late it happened in a fairly scrappy fashion i think steve was working with a terribly small team

319
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,440
 um i think you could do a lot more with it if we have a printed newsletter then people

320
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,920
 due to world calls often don't see that either so so that is a whole issue with

321
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,520
 well communications generally the bigger this is quite a big world call the bigger the world

322
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,040
 call the harder is to get your messages out to members at the convention yeah no i agree with that

323
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,560
 and i think did i just not get to program early enough to see any of this i think you must have just

324
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,520
 yeah i you didn't get there early enough or like there were probably rooms in the cramplars that

325
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,920
 didn't have it i can only remember seeing it in one of the our guile rooms probably one or two

326
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,280
 but maybe not three and and maybe maybe it depended if there was someone there to turn it on because

327
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,880
 not every room was manned for every item and and i feel like this is the first go at a new model for

328
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,480
 how you do this and it ought to you know there's a lot more we could do with this model because i

329
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,120
 don't think we're going to be doing paper newsletters forever i think it is a you know i think we've

330
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,080
 known it's due for a little while and i think it's doomed but it's not that i miss paper newsletters

331
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,400
 it's that i miss knowing i can go somewhere two or three times a day to get a concise set of

332
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,640
 information that is useful to me and there will be some humor in it and i didn't get that from this

333
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,680
 newsletter yes that that no no neither did i and that's the thing right if the only the only place i

334
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,800
 knew i could go to get the information was the volunteer room because i'm not going to go to a

335
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,920
 program item just to see the newsletter and then leave again because that would be the actions of

336
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,880
 a lunatic and also the thing is it's the same thing you get you know when you go in a restaurant

337
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,280
 that has electronic menus and the menu switches away from the menu item you want to order and you've

338
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,480
 got to wait a minute for the menu item you want to order to come back so you can look at what it

339
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,720
 costs and what the options are it was that where it's like oh there's a bit always gone and then

340
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,720
 because it's like eight slides or whatever it takes ages for it to come back round it's like

341
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,240
 c-fax for the 21st century yeah it's like i kind of feel and maybe i am wrong but there is a reason

342
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,000
 that paper newspapers have survived and c-fax has not and i think it is because paper news is a

343
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,280
 better solution than c-fax to delivering information and so i think if i was going to pick one i would

344
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:49,040
 have picked paper newsletters and i'm relatively tech forward i love that you're on i love that

345
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,960
 you're on that side of the argument today but i i a person who has been arguing this point for many

346
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,400
 many years at this point and on the other side i mean i kind of agree we are having paper newsletter

347
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,960
 reconnect i believe we we are we have made arrangements to ship our little printers over there and

348
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,280
 because i'm not doing anything else for reconnect i think i'm going to be working on it so that

349
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,320
 should up the humor value hashtag dot even a bit arrogant i have always been pro having

350
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,280
 information in as many places as you can possibly have it and wanting there to be paper newsletters

351
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,720
 entirely i have always been a fan of paper newsletters because i think the answer is both i think the

352
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,200
 answer is usually both when you're trying to communicate things or even not both but as many

353
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,200
 as you can and this gets to something that i think was a problem i think this is a problem with this

354
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,320
 convention that dates back to mid 2019 where this convention had a publication under promotions

355
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:51,440
 division and i was arguing as far back as luncon that that model was not fit for purpose because

356
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,880
 the primary function of both of those divisions is to disseminate information to people and it used

357
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,960
 to work very well because the way they did that was very different and i think the way they they do

358
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,520
 it is getting more and more similar over time and so at this convention you have promotions

359
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:16,160
 which did a very very good job and was very good you had publications which we will get to but i

360
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,680
 think if you were going to pick the division that did the worst job at Glasgow it would probably be

361
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:26,320
 that one no offense to anyone who worked on it but i'm really sorry yeah and then you had online

362
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,120
 services which was technically not its own division it was under the it division which is the tail

363
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,360
 wagging the dog but basically i worked with and andrew and emily on discord and that was one of the

364
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,120
 other big ways the convention had of communicating information to members and it is notable that

365
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:51,120
 what that means is you have three you have the two code dh's of promotions you have the publications

366
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,920
 dh and you have paul taylor who is the dh of online and alan bond who is an area head the area head in

367
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:04,240
 charge of the entire online convention which should be its own division and this speak who then caught

368
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,200
 covid the day before the convention no it was later because he had british andrew and emily

369
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,800
 on like friday morning the point being even if he hadn't caught covid he should have been committee

370
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,160
 level there's no way you want that person to be an area head that that doesn't make any sense

371
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:26,080
 and this speaks to a problem with how we i think this speaks to something with how the world

372
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,040
 con was constituted which probably made a lot more sense pre pandemic than it did post pandemic

373
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,840
 but also meant that the world con had a very fractured idea of how it was going to disseminate

374
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,880
 information and i think there are aspects where that became very clear i was on the discord trying

375
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,160
 to disseminate information but because we weren't in promotions i couldn't like directly interface

376
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,640
 with the social media team i was having to like send emails and like that got very complicated

377
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,160
 and i just think there were barriers there that didn't need to be there and that is one of the

378
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,440
 one of the more frustrating things i found about this convention from the perspective of working

379
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,840
 on it i mean i think there's a couple things that i think one is that like your workflow cannot

380
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,160
 just be the work flow can't be paper newsletter or thing in program rooms or whatever your workflow

381
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,720
 needs to be okay this is the information this is how we set up our workflow so it becomes a thing

382
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,640
 we can't explain the program rooms and a thing which you know gets posted to a discord channel

383
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,560
 at a certain time and a thing which becomes like a thing which is easy to read on the web not

384
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,520
 a pdf or slides and we don't have that workflow i think the other thing is that cross-divisional

385
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,320
 communication within world constructors can be tricky because you have to give people the autonomy

386
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,800
 to go and do stuff themselves but also make sure they don't go off and promise a bunch of stuff

387
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,760
 and then their division head says no actually we're not doing that so i think that's a general

388
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,400
 it's always difficult right and so one thing is also the more divisions you create sometimes

389
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,560
 the more of that you end up with in fact one of the things that happened this time was that messages

390
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,480
 from the convention were included in all of the newsletter messaging and that was a problem because

391
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,120
 those messages were extremely dull and very repetitive and that's that's an issue that that

392
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:09,840
 you need to have somebody quite senior and in fact all of megg and ester and margarit could have done

393
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:17,520
 this but it what happened was people who were immediately below that level who were not capable

394
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,920
 of seeing that if you are going to message people it needs to be amusing it always you can have the

395
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,280
 odd message that is that is dull but necessary but the vast majority of your messaging needs to be

396
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,120
 light-hearted or people will not read it they will not pay attention and they will turn off from

397
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,160
 those things and we know that for a long time you know people at the World Cup have fun they don't

398
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:46,240
 want they don't want the bad news yes i think that's true i don't think you need a mix of messaging

399
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,800
 so you need you need like a light-hearted vehicle so the print newsletter is often quite like jokey

400
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,240
 and light-hearted but like the messages are on discord so for instance levitation the message on

401
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,520
 discord tend to be a little bit less light-hearted and more informational because you're conveying

402
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,720
 that information differently and what you want there is brevity so that someone can quickly

403
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,760
 grasp what it is they've just seen in announcements and then go and read a different part of the

404
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,960
 discord but like the other thing is that you've just got to put as much of your information out in

405
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,080
 as many ways as possible because there will be people who only read the facebook there will be

406
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,520
 people who only read blue sky there will be people who only read discord there will be people who

407
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,040
 only read email there will be people who read none of those but might see something if it's like

408
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,680
 thrust in front of them in paper form there will be people who will see it if it's like on a screen

409
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,560
 in a program i am what you get to is a thing where you are like liz says you are coming up with

410
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,400
 information you want to disseminate and you want to disseminate it through every organ you have

411
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,320
 and if those organs are separated on different sides of divisional divides that gets harder for

412
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,360
 no reason and this isn't something i should say this isn't something your world con is uniquely

413
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:58,960
 bad at every organization has trouble getting information from silo to silo like from i mean god

414
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,480
 knows i work in academia and like getting information from different academic departments or research

415
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,600
 groups to each other that is also a problem just because you talk less to people who are further

416
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,840
 away from you and that means it is harder to communicate with them and so i'm not trying to

417
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:20,480
 diss world con i'm not trying to diss the world con for not being good enough at going cross division

418
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,720
 but what i am trying to do is say you need to think very carefully about where you put the walls

419
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,280
 because it is difficult to cross them and so the less the fewer walls you have in between parts of

420
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,680
 the convention that we'll need to talk to each other the better so for instance and god knows

421
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,000
 mega mat didn't need more work but i think there is a strong argument that online convention should

422
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,560
 probably be have been under promotions not under it because i think that would have made more sense

423
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,160
 in a conveying information direction but then that's not really promotions division anymore because

424
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,760
 it's doing a lot more than just promotions but then the promotion division does a lot more than

425
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,120
 promotions now anyway it's not just because you're doing all of your at con communication with

426
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,080
 members through social media and that's not really promotions at that point that's member services

427
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,800
 and so i just which is a different division so this is this is kind of what i mean i think

428
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,960
 and i don't think this is Glasgow specific either but i think world con generally needs to take a step

429
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:21,760
 back and work out how the last five years have changed how these structures need to be so so

430
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,880
 will con felt this organization have felt quite bureaucratic to work within even by the standards

431
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,880
 of world con and i think this is speaking to what you're saying but what it meant was

432
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,240
 often very long layers as you said some very major parts of the convention which were

433
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,400
 at area head level some very long chains of of responsibilities so you'd find yourself

434
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,000
 side of five levels down in the organization you know 100 000 personal organizations

435
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,040
 try not to have more than five levels of bureaucracy and i'm not sure we need that for con

436
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,400
 running and i think we need to look at having simpler flatter structures generally and i don't

437
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,400
 know i don't know how you do that other than by saying oh yeah no alfjara world con which i

438
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,160
 absolutely will not do i'm very glad for people who run world courts me too and i i think because

439
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,320
 a lot of recon stuff that like area heads and below we're doing kind of went up to division heads for

440
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,400
 approval i think we then got to a situation on the ground where there are a lot of area heads

441
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,120
 running important stuff who did not have autonomy to just make decisions and so they were paralyzed

442
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,800
 because they need to go and find their decision head division head to make decision and then you

443
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,720
 have only maybe 12 or 15 people who are in charge of an awful lot so i think we need to kind of do

444
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,360
 that you need people have a bit more autonomy pre-con then by the time they get to the con they can

445
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,600
 just go ahead with stuff and they're not waiting for someone else to tell them this is okay because

446
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,480
 that's a recipe for a small number of people who are massively overworked i mean you get that

447
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,480
 anyway but you know a smaller amount of people who are paralyzing everything else because they

448
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,480
 cannot be in six place at once this is not this is also compounded and i think it's very important

449
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,760
 we recognize so for those who aren't familiar with world con the way world con works there is a

450
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,240
 committee role called death of emails and the role of that person is to be on every single email list

451
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,680
 and tell people who are having parallel discussions where they haven't looped each other in that

452
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:22,000
 those discussions need to be combined so basically the role of that person is effectively to keep an

453
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,440
 eye on these walls and to make the walls more porous and that is a very good thing that i have

454
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,360
 not seen other organizations do and i think that is something world con does better than a lot of

455
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,960
 organizations the problem in this particular case is that the death of emails committee role was a

456
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,000
 man called ben yellow and long time listeners will know that he was disinvited from clasco and

457
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,080
 that role was never re recruited and so glasco was at a bit of a disadvantage here on account of

458
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,760
 the whole Chengdu kerfuffle because if that role had been someone else i think a lot of these problems

459
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,840
 would have been better and i think the fact he was taken off staff exacerbated some of this

460
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,760
 and that isn't that isn't glasco's fault really i don't think because i do think i would not have

461
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,640
 wanted ben to continue beyond program program on committee so yeah you can't do that because

462
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,120
 the other thing about death of emails is that you can see everything apart from maybe stuff that

463
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:20,400
 goes only to the chair so they have to be someone who is quite high level but that you can trust

464
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,640
 with everything i think the i mean it is a problem that glasco if they did not re-recruit someone to

465
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,720
 replace ben like you know he left because of tingdu issues but he could have left for any reason

466
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,000
 and i think the other thing is that now you know when i did longcon in 2014 it was basically

467
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,560
 nearly everything was done through email and a few kind of group chats for little mini things

468
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,960
 now it is email and discord and a mix of discord channels open to everyone and discord channels open

469
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,840
 only to your own division and then at con it's a mix of discord and the email and what's up

470
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,280
 because people are getting too many pings on discord so they have to be on what's up instead

471
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,200
 and we've just fragmented everything a bit too much so i don't i mean i don't solution to that

472
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,560
 because i think the fragmentation is probably useful in some ways but um yeah you've got to have

473
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,040
 you've got to try and be aware of all these cross-communications that are happening and the

474
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,320
 solution is probably not to have everything open to more people because i know you get 10 people

475
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,840
 sticking there or in about how you know tech division should make this decision which they

476
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,600
 already made six months ago and you don't know all the information so you've got to kind of

477
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,080
 stop the natural tendency of fans to give advice on everything but also making things a bit more

478
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,120
 open that's very tricky needle to thread look Liz let's not cast too many stones at fans who like

479
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,200
 giving advice on everything on our podcast where we're telling them how they should do their jobs

480
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,160
 right yeah but we're not actually personally going to run a world called just check just say i also

481
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,480
 absolutely did that on the world con discord i would like go in and think i was being helpful

482
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,400
 and probably not be helpful and this is because my brain is like oh but you have done this before

483
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,600
 you must have helpful information it's like no you actually haven't done it for like a long time

484
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:59,920
 me too but i cut i cut back once i noticed i mean i noticed other people being worse and i was like

485
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,720
 oh can we talk about publications please yeah i for one enjoyed going to land of Scots

486
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,800
 if you were only going to print one thing would it be the thing that people are going to read

487
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,640
 afterwards when they get home or would it be the thing that they need this weekend in order

488
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,600
 to work out what's going on oh hang on oh i i disagree with your framing here but fair enough

489
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,560
 continue so i don't i do not think this should have been a printed document at all i do think the

490
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,280
 convention program guide should have been prevented printed in sufficient numbers that anybody who

491
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,960
 wanted one should should have a been given one and then being taken out to the back and quietly shot

492
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,960
 and showed how modern smartphones work but there we go all right so i am simultaneously i am

493
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,200
 simultaneously disagreeing from i'm disagreeing with you from two different directions here

494
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,600
 i'm a big fan of printing the pretty thing that can be the souvenir rather than the ephemeral thing

495
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,120
 that will go in the bin when i have my like agent track off ski hardbacks i buy the hardbacks with

496
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:05,280
 the very pretty covers because i want them as objects of art and i don't mind having world

497
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:12,480
 con souvenir books because they are a souvenir key word here is by why am i paying so that people

498
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,840
 who like bits of dead tree can have no i mean and and i agree i don't i wouldn't mind if it was a

499
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:23,200
 fiber extra i do think it needs to be pre-com because so it gets tricky right because what you

500
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,120
 don't want to do is for someone not to notice that they need to buy it in advance and then not have

501
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,640
 one for them the other thing you don't want to do is print them all afterwards and send them

502
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,440
 through the post because that is much worse for the environment and so like i actually do think

503
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,440
 having a table of them where you have some guesses to how many you're going to need print that many

504
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,080
 and have them at the convention is probably the right model i would be interested to know how

505
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,040
 many they had left and i hope what world cons are doing are discussing what percentage of them go

506
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,640
 like and printing a number that makes sense in that context i hope there aren't thousands of

507
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,760
 unclaimed ones left over i would be interested to know how many go in the bin i would be interested

508
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,160
 to know how many i'll never looked at again i was like why haven't we got a pdf yet and i have

509
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,920
 you told the answers because they're going to correct it which does make some sense which

510
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,080
 leads me on to my next blood about the souvenir book the question i have is why are we not printing

511
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,360
 the paper program guide is it because it's too expensive in which case i think we do need to

512
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,480
 reevaluate you know what we're including in a membership cost and what we're not the number one

513
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,960
 question i think that i got a program participant check-in was do you have a paper copy of the program

514
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,840
 and the answer was no we don't try the accessibility desk i think they did have some i think they end

515
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,480
 up with quite a few but that was like an enormous question so if the answer is we're not printing

516
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,720
 them to try and push people to smartphones i think we should we just have to accept that not

517
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,920
 everyone wants to use their smartphone yet and we need to have more copies than we had and there

518
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,800
 are still problems with people who find it hard to read their smartphones on the go or

519
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,680
 had technical problems with the con guide and things like that so i think we need to decide why

520
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:06,240
 we are doing it i was like i did not see any physical copies of the program change street

521
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,960
 sheets at this comp normally there are some pink change sheets which you will find like

522
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,360
 with the newsletter and stuff i don't know how you would have done that because they didn't give

523
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:20,800
 the newsletter any printing exactly so i i think they were printed i mean you said you don't normally

524
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,240
 print them but you normally distribute them in the same places because then you train people to go

525
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,880
 and pick up bits of paper yeah well when i've done when i've done newsletters they've made us print

526
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,600
 the pink sheets okay newsletter never printed the pink sheets when i did program but your online

527
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,760
 program guide doesn't tell you what has changed and it also is no good if you have a paper copy of

528
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,640
 the program and also the paper copy of the program was a very strange format not made for printing

529
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,960
 well it was made for printing in a particular very tall and narrow format which i don't mind

530
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,960
 but it's not made for printing on like a four paper or anything so if you want to print your

531
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,400
 own version before you come to com also had mistakes that was another problem i would like to say

532
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,880
 something and before i say i would i would like to encourage anyone who is likely to be upset by

533
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,960
 savage criticism of this world gone to cover their ears for the next 10 seconds i think you need to

534
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,240
 spell your guests of honor's name right in your fucking souvenir book the attention to detail in

535
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:20,080
 this book was a fucking disgrace anything else you can get wrong that one you cannot you just cannot

536
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:25,040
 to be honest when someone says to me what did you think of the Glasgow souvenir book at the moment

537
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,560
 i go oh is that the one that took place in Scotland with two teas i don't go oh yeah that was full of

538
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:38,560
 great articles and artwork i think about the really awkward cringe worthy errors and they're very small

539
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:45,440
 things so it it really lets down what is otherwise quite a nice publication that you know can stand on

540
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,040
 would be able to go on the shelf with pride along with your vast collection of world called

541
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,880
 souvenir books which i do have actually you know i have i have kept one from every world god i've

542
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,920
 gone to i've got not that i mean speaking of how many we think there's going to be left over from

543
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,200
 2024 if you did want a 2005 Glasgow souvenir book you could have picked one up on the freebies table

544
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,800
 this year oh do we still have 1980 the 1987 one the hardback one because though there were thousands

545
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,200
 of those knocking around for decades but i think they're all gone i didn't check it's just i know

546
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,640
 the 2005 one has that very nice cover so i recognize it from a distance when i did so for those who

547
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,440
 don't know because i don't know i never know what people know and it's probably better to tell

548
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:32,320
 people twice than tell people zero times i i was the dth for publications at lungcon 3 in 2014

549
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:38,000
 working with case van tawne who was my dh and i did all of the progress reports for London i

550
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,480
 my i just did them me and me and and then i sent them to jhanis gill who proofread them and made

551
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,840
 try hadn't made stupid mistakes and then they got published and they were very good and i got to

552
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,080
 use uh brine tailber artwork on all of them and i was extremely proud of them and i still have

553
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:55,600
 copies of them in my house definitely used alison scott art work on at least one of them just saying

554
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:02,720
 yes on the progress report minus one the cover was uh the hit truck is going to the galaxy i think

555
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,160
 was the hit track collector london by one alison scott i still have it on my fan art page i was

556
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,600
 quite pleased with that one and john commissioned it long long time ago it's a good it's a good piece

557
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:19,360
 um so the and at that point we still we were mandated by the wussfus constitution to send out

558
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,000
 physical pr's and we broke the rules because pr4 we didn't send out physically we're just like

559
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,480
 we're not going to uh because we don't want to we think it's a waste of money we think it's a waste

560
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,120
 of paper it's just a lot of effort and we're not gonna and so i do have a lot of sympathy for

561
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:39,200
 publications and for paper and things and i just wanted to note that because i've been working towards

562
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,680
 using less paper in this realm for a long time but i also don't think the answer is zero paper i'm

563
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,720
 kind of in the middle of this yeah but no it's not good enough you you need to proofread

564
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,520
 your publications and if you don't have time to proofread your publication you need to give it

565
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:02,080
 a little bit more time and proofread it and this i believe that it went out in draft quite a lot

566
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,720
 of people all of whom were very busy and none of whom thought it was their responsibility to make

567
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,000
 sure it didn't have errors in it so making sure that you have somebody on the con who absolutely

568
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,680
 knows that it's their responsibility to deliver something as error-free as possible i think is

569
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,920
 critical because there's got to be some errors you know if if the error on the cover or the error on

570
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,560
 the guest of ottopage had been the only error in the entire book people would have gone oh well

571
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,440
 that was a bit stupid but in fact the things riddled with errors errors got into it between when i

572
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,440
 sent stuff in and when it got printed you know which is what normally happens with documents

573
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,880
 that's why you have to proofread proofread is very important and we love them

574
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:49,040
 anyway this was the bit that and right okay so i just i want to make very clear

575
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,440
 given that this is the thing i'm most disappointed in the convention for that tells you how good the

576
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,360
 convention was because there are conventions where i've had significantly bigger criticisms than this

577
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:05,040
 one and it is it does suck to be negative and i am yeah it was a little bit unfortunate in time

578
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,320
 because what happens is you register for convention you get a little stuff and they give you a

579
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,200
 program book and you go what yep yep yep yep unless you don't realize you're supposed to pick it up

580
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,440
 and you forget and go and get one on Saturday morning i think the the nice person on registration

581
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,480
 told me to get a program but i'd save a book but not to me but i mean i guess it was like busy and

582
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,200
 it was staff registration and i wanted off anyway so we're not going to talk in detail about covid

583
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,800
 you can see a lot of past episodes where we've talked a lot about cover policies and and so on

584
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:39,200
 and i don't think we have much new to say about Glasgow's but i will say you know a bunch of people

585
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,240
 got covid at the calm and Glasgow had a covid policy where they recommended wearing masks and testing

586
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,440
 and i think a lot of people just hadn't read it or weren't aware of it and didn't kind of have

587
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,840
 that little mental reminder that you are going to a giant event maybe you should bring some masks

588
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,840
 and covid tests just in case and then you have a lot of people trying to find covid tests the

589
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,680
 con cannot afford to provide you know five covid tests per participant it's going to be

590
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,880
 always a limited number people scrambling to find them in like local pharmacies i think

591
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:15,360
 they just probably needed to stick that somewhere in an email to say you know please remember to bring

592
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,760
 whatever precautions you are bringing and bring some tests just in case and that might have helped

593
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:26,800
 us a bit when you know the covid cases were kicking off on Sunday and Monday so we talk about discord

594
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:34,160
 i like discord oh i like discord i did like the con discord but it was also a lot of con discord

595
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,240
 and i'm kind of in two minds i think it's good to have a big con discord and it's nice to have

596
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,720
 lots of activity but there was also stuff like hello i'm going to go into con discord and ask

597
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,560
 a question which has already been answered seven times on facebook and three times on this discord

598
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,200
 did you know that sometimes in Scotland you get different money out of cash machines because i

599
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:59,520
 know that now toy money god yeah because i heard that a lot and did you know that most

600
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,600
 place in Glasgow will take cards because i heard that a lot for you and then i end up getting some

601
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,000
 Scottish money out to pay the one vendor who didn't take cards but yeah did you know Liz that the

602
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,720
 tap water in Scotland is drinkable and the lose in certain Glasgow stations cost a coin to use

603
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,360
 because that was another one that came up bewilderingly often tap wall one is interesting though actually

604
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:25,840
 because i default to assuming the tap water is safe to drink pretty much everywhere and then

605
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,520
 have to mentally remind myself nope and then i know a lot of people who come from place where

606
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,760
 the tap water is not drinkable who have who basically will assume that you can't drink it

607
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,400
 unless someone tells them otherwise so it's worth saying once and it's also worth noting that it's

608
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,880
 not fizzy water so it doesn't have bubbles i helped with the discord but most of it was

609
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,000
 Andrew and Emily January who do lots of good things i helped with the social bit so i ran a

610
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:55,120
 scavenger hunt and i ran if i ran the zuc on we covered those in the live episode i think

611
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:03,120
 i'm going to criticize the discord i think i underestimated how busy it would be when we were

612
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:09,360
 when i was advising Emily and Andrew on on things and i think we should have more aggressively

613
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:17,200
 gated a lot more channels so that it was much more possible to out of the box just get channels

614
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,880
 that gave you information and not gave you discussion so that's something i would take for next time

615
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,480
 i will also say in hindsight i wonder whether the staff discord and the con discord should have

616
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:34,640
 been kept separate because i'm very used to aggressively muting channels on discord but i think

617
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,760
 people who are less used to discord are less used to muting channels and having a completely separate

618
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:47,120
 discord for staff chat might have helped people not need to go to whatsapp i think switching the

619
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:53,840
 channel over the discord server over at the last minute was a massive mistake yeah i'm not sure

620
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,600
 i mean i don't know if i think it was massive well i think if they've done it three weeks if

621
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,000
 they don't three weeks in advance or a month in advance it would be fine i think doing it at the

622
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,720
 very last minute meant that people then had to try and find their staff stuff in this sea of

623
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,720
 convention discord and couldn't cope because the great benefit of having most of your

624
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,000
 communication on discord is that you get a built-in death of emails because all the committee can

625
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,600
 see everything like and so it's actually quite nice and it was very useful for a discord perspective

626
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,360
 because he as emily andrew were in charge of this court they could see discussions happening

627
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,600
 everywhere and they could be like oh this division is having this conversation and they are about

628
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,200
 to ask us to do a thing and we start thinking about that early thank you for the kind words

629
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:38,160
 about the discord peeps it was mostly emily and andrew i basically just sort of said vaguely helpful

630
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,800
 things occasionally and made a spreadsheet is there anything else you want to talk about on

631
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:50,000
 cons we need more maps and also we need some way to identify which building rooms are in and

632
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,920
 unfortunately the system of the islands or whatever it was or in this one and the locks are in a

633
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,560
 different one only works if you know about scollet geography and even that i mean i didn't know what

634
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:05,360
 alsh ash one and two because yes i guess lok alsh is a lok but that's not how people think of lok al

635
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:12,240
 at all they think of color look alsh and there is a discord server which has spun off called um

636
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:18,000
 fancon.dev which is basically people who are interested in developing software solutions for

637
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,400
 conventions and friend of the show andrew january is prototyping a new way of doing convention maps

638
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,520
 in his copious spare time and so i am interested to see where that goes because yeah one of the things

639
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:36,960
 we got very frustrated about was the quality of the maps we had available i'm saying we a lot

640
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:44,720
 it was mostly andrew because of the most go on the portal

641
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:52,080
 i'm going to pick the acolyte which is denny plus show it's a star wars show it was imperfect

642
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,680
 but it was a hell of a lot more interesting than some of the other star wars shows looking at you

643
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,680
 asoka and the reason i'm picking it is twofold firstly manage a sinto's massive arms yeah

644
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:08,560
 uh as um recommended by noted science fiction critic abigail nusbaum who is fully in favor of

645
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:14,160
 managers and toes arms if you like good arms this is a show for you congratulations go to your

646
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:20,800
 book out abigail it has been cancelled because dizney make decisions out of fear rather than out of

647
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:26,960
 any desire to make good things this is most evident in lucas film which makes me very sad

648
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,720
 and there is a petition to bring it back and i'm going to put it in the show notes and it probably

649
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,520
 won't do anything but christa loyev i just want them to make more interesting star wars that isn't

650
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:42,000
 just more bloody day for loney live action crap that's my pick you say they do it out of fear

651
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,880
 rather than desire to make good things but don't don't they do it out of desire to make more money

652
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:54,480
 there was an attempt to break down number of hours of content watched on dizney plus by different

653
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,440
 shows and i did think it was interesting that andrew came out pretty low but obviously kind of

654
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,080
 got the critical acclaim and so on and so there is going to be a season two it seems like the acolyte

655
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:09,760
 suffered from not having as many viewers as something with baby odourine and then maybe also

656
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,360
 not getting the critical acclaim i think i'm watching it but i understand like there's some

657
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:18,240
 stuff that happens midway through maybe involving manager sinto and his lovely arms

658
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,360
 and that maybe means you need to give it a few more episodes to get going and that may have hurt it

659
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:29,040
 it's imperfect but i think the main problem was there was a giant brigade of hateful

660
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:34,800
 sawa's fans who was like hang on a minute this has this has people of colour in it and um yeah

661
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:40,880
 i am fed up with capitulating to those people i thought i will i will see two movies this week

662
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,800
 i am bound to be able to pick one and i am managing it but this is a bit of a retro pick

663
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,840
 in that i am picking nimona and i understand i am late to the party have either of you picked nimona

664
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:58,640
 i don't remember i mean they might pick the comic liz taste maker batty strikes again

665
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:07,840
 web comic was to web comic first yeah boy um and stevenson so it is it is a movie it is a fairly

666
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:16,320
 cute animated movie with lots and lots of good things in it it is about a chap who despite being

667
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:24,720
 top of his classes face doesn't fit in a kind of weird futuristic medieval world and so therefore

668
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:32,000
 gets framed for a crime and becomes an app cast and he makes friends with a girl who turns out to be

669
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 a bit tantier shape shifting and together they fight crime they do not fight crime but they attempt

670
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,560
 to clear his name and it kind of goes in many of the directions you think it might go but it's

671
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:51,200
 quite entertaining while it does it and the animation is very good and riz armored who plays the chap

672
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,600
 is extremely good in the voice acting the voice acting is generally pretty good but he is

673
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,720
 outstanding i think and i enjoyed it quite a lot and it's definitely worth one hour and 42 minutes

674
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:08,560
 of your netflix time which is how i watched it and it was a hugo finalist i think last year yes

675
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,880
 we discussed it in our hugo episode and you guys said it was good and i was like i'll definitely

676
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,160
 get around to watching that and now i have it's quite good isn't it so there we go it's quite good

677
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:24,880
 and i'm picking it i want riz amed to be the first asian james bond oh he'd be good just massive

678
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,520
 non sequitur but like i know not everyone agrees with that i just think he would be elos good in a

679
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:36,560
 suit he's great actor like come on guys let's do this what about dev patello he looks good in a suit

680
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:44,720
 good actor i like i don't see why we can't actually have a pair of crime fighting spy dudes in a in

681
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:50,720
 a double act here this would be good too i also kind of think anyway i let's not have a huge

682
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,240
 aggression right now about how they should do james bond films but i've thought about that as

683
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,840
 well i mean i think if you're going to have a duo it's not james bond it's like the man from

684
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:02,800
 uncle or something that's fine yeah that'd be good you but but why can't it be james bond gold and

685
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:08,000
 i had double o six and admittedly he turned out to be the baddie exactly but there's like probably

686
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:14,320
 eight other double o's let's have some more of them in the films can you imagine can you imagine

687
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,120
 a james bond film where it was dev patello learning to be the new double o seven from riz amed

688
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:24,720
 that'd be fucking great imagine we just remade golden eye with riz amed and dev patello

689
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:31,280
 yes do it do it cowards do it amazon get on it liz do you have a pick i am going to pick the case

690
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:38,320
 the gold nidal oh it is a puzzle game i don't think alison has picked it have you played it though

691
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,920
 um i've played it i don't think i picked it so much picked it no i don't think i don't think you have

692
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,880
 and i don't think either of us either of me or liz picked nimono so i think it is three new picks

693
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:56,000
 this time what what platform did you play on liz i played it on Netflix games or or on my mobile

694
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,600
 telephone which is not great actually you probably want to play it on something with a slightly bigger

695
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:06,800
 screen because it will test your eyesight for certain puzzles so basically case gold nidal is a kind of

696
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:13,840
 detective puzzle game where you click through there's various cases and you basically click through

697
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:20,720
 sort of in a point and clicky way on little pixel art of what's going on in the story of the golden

698
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:26,720
 idol which is a mysterious relic which has some supernatural powers and as you go through you are

699
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:32,880
 basically it gives you kind of a an outline of what's going on with lots of missing names and verbs

700
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,640
 and nouns and that kind of thing and you have to fill them all in and piece the narrative together

701
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,320
 from the clues you can put together by clicking through the different screens and it's very fun

702
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:49,600
 there's a main game of about nine episodes i think and then two dlc's i'm currently in the middle of

703
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:54,880
 the second dlc trying to figure out what on earth is going on and it's very good i think it's

704
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,440
 pictured about the right level like most of the puzzles are doable but you have to think and then

705
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,280
 occasionally i've come across somewhere you can do it but i sort of brute-forced a couple of them

706
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,560
 because i didn't really figure out what's going on and then there's somewhere i've just been like

707
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:12,480
 yeah i don't know what's going on here i'm gonna get a hint i will say there is a slight bug at least

708
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:19,120
 in the android version of the netflix games one where it will accidentally think you have finished

709
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,040
 the last episode before you have filled in all the blanks and then give you kind of what happened

710
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:28,160
 which is unfortunate but i was most the way to figuring that out anyway okay so you should definitely

711
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,960
 play it but maybe not on an android phone on netflix until they have updated that but i think it'd be

712
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,480
 great on an ipad or something yeah i've got netflix at the moment so i will play it on my ipad yes i

713
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,440
 think that bug where you learn too much in the final puzzle is is there an ipad as well i think

714
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:49,120
 that's happened to me that was the old thought podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me

715
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:53,840
 and it's goodbye from me

716
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:18,000
 next time you're running podcast programming can i suggest an item on how to get your

717
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,840
 co-hosts shut up so you can get a word in eduase oh it's true it would just be me

718
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:27,680
 and you too and you won't be able to see anything i don't think that's true i don't think that's

719
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,720
 true i think there are other podcasts that have this issue liz you are there is a podcast i love

720
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:38,640
 called three being salad and uh the liz on that podcast is mike wozniak uh because he is the one

721
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,960
 that struggles to get a word in so like it is not just you you are not alone i feel like that on

722
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:49,920
