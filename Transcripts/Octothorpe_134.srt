1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 If I have strong feelings, I will think about them.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:19,760
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 134th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,800
 Science Fiction and Science Fiction fandom, which is coming to you late. I'm John Coxon.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,760
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. John, I think you should keep that real-time pause in.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,280
 For how long it took Alison to react.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,480
 Just realised we've had a letter from Tobes.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
 No, we've got quite a lot of letters.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,600
 So we do have a letter from Tobes. Do you want to introduce that one, Alison?

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,400
 Happy to.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,200
 Tobes wrote to us after we discussed him last episode and he said,

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,360
 "I met Jason Isaacs once. I still remember what he said to me.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,600
 Who are you and what the hell are you doing in my house?"

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,360
 Such a sweet guy.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,560
 So thanks for that, Tobes.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,680
 We also heard from Clary, who said, "They really enjoy Octothorpe live and so

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,520
 glad it seems to be a regular fiction now."

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,040
 I think we quite like it as well.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
 I mean, we don't want to become one of those people who demand a spot on the program,

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,040
 but I think hungover people enjoy us.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,800
 And yes, Clary reckons Octothorpe live gives a nice burst of community feeling before everyone heads home.

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,280
 Also, Clary would like to apologise when flying on the Discord that Alison gave everyone COVID at Birmingham.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,920
 She gave me COVID at Birmingham, but that isn't enough data to support a strong statistical analysis.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,680
 Did you give Clary COVID at Birmingham?

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
 Okay, so I have two things to say here.

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,120
 The first is, I'm looking for some support for Liz here on the,

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,080
 you can't actually tell who it was who gave it to you.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,360
 But also, I believe that Clary and I were in the same conversation for some time with the person who I played for giving me COVID.

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,840
 And I suspect that that person gave us both COVID at Eastcon.

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,080
 Yes, unfortunately, we probably cannot do this.

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,320
 The statistically rigorous method, like reconstruct those chains.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,240
 Yeah, yeah. If I get COVID any more times at Eastcon, it will start to become a statistically significant data set of its very own.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,760
 But no, I didn't catch COVID this Easter, so that was good.

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,960
 Congratulations.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,320
 At least not as far as I know.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,760
 So, well, hey.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:22,400
 We also heard from Collette Reap, who said that she was listening to the latest podcast this morning

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,200
 and noticed that I was not sure how to pronounce the name Erian,

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,720
 as in Erian Weston, who is a finalist for Best Fan Writer,

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,520
 and so wrote in to tell me that that is how.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,240
 So thank you very much, Collette. I appreciate it very much.

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,760
 Although she does note, disclaimer.

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,840
 She speaks Swedish with a Stockholm accent.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
 Other Swedish accents are available.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,040
 Other Swedes, please write in with phonetic manglings of Swedish words that we will then bongon on the podcast.

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,160
 Yay!

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,200
 Or don't.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,800
 Multiculturalism.

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
 It is possible that we have already mentioned this, but it's so good.

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
 We're going to mention it twice, if so.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,160
 Rosanna Pendelbury had noticed that we mentioned in our last regular episode

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,960
 that two of our picks had had in-depth reviews by Rosanna Pendelbury,

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,680
 and the third had not being not genre.

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,840
 So she went ahead and watched the Death of Stalin and did a fabulous review of it,

54
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,200
 which you can go and read.

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
 And I would recommend that you do.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
 And we're going to put a link in the show notes.

57
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,280
 Thank you very much, Rosanna.

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,720
 That is considerable commitment to the bit, and we appreciate it.

59
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,560
 It was great.

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,960
 I had an enthusiastic conversation with Rosanna about this at Eastcon, and it is very good.

61
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,160
 Yes, me too.

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,280
 Rosanna was the only person to take me up on the offer of

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,320
 buy me a drink, and I will tell you my Dragon Age opinions at length,

64
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,480
 and we did for like an hour and a half.

65
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,880
 That was good.

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,920
 Chris Garcia writes in to say, "They have nominated

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
 Andrews to its TikTok feed as best-related work."

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,320
 Fair enough.

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,680
 And has also nominated a different TikTok in best dramatic presentation short form.

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,600
 So, you know, there's a range of opinions on TikToks.

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,960
 Chris does mention Chris Barkley's lawsuit against A. McCarty,

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,360
 which we will get to later in the episode,

73
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,400
 and says, "I have a Dungeons and Dragons box that Gary gave me years ago."

74
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,960
 So, you know, good, good one, Chris.

75
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,320
 That is probably in your best name drops that you've done.

76
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,040
 So, hurrah.

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,960
 Thanks for it again.

78
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,280
 Probably not planning to sell it, is he?

79
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,360
 I don't know.

80
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,080
 I'd guess he'd put it in a museum, but I might be wrong.

81
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,800
 Yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,760
 Thank you to everyone who posted on Facebook,

83
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,640
 so that his "I'm gonna read them all out."

84
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:50,960
 *reads text*

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:05:19,840
 *reads text*

86
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,720
 In our live episode from Iskahn 133,

87
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,760
 we discussed lapping the papal conclave,

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,000
 and various people linked like RPGs of doing a papal conclave.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,720
 But someone, I think it was Tammy Coxin, reminded me that A.

90
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,920
 Department does do a class every year at the University of Chicago,

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,440
 which is literally lapping a papal conclave.

92
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,280
 And this week got a writer from the New York Times,

93
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,560
 possibly because the winner of the papal conclave has said,

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,720
 "Well, I'm on the only Pope right now, right?"

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,560
 So it is actually a delightful write-up with lots of photos,

96
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,960
 because they all dress up in medieval costumes,

97
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,720
 and it does look really fun.

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,160
 I mean, I'm not sure the depth of research I would need to accurately portray

99
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,200
 a character in this papal lab is obviously more than I'm ever going to do,

100
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,360
 but I am delighted that there are a bunch of college students

101
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,000
 who are just super excited to go to college and pretend to be the Borges.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,560
 *reads text*

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,760
 Doing just a little bit about Corflu, so the cover makes sense.

104
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,120
 Apparently, yes.

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,840
 And listen.

106
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,080
 So I just wanted to say,

107
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
 we've been to conventions recently.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,640
 I think we're going to not talk about EasterCon terribly much today,

109
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,960
 because we have some other things to talk about.

110
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,360
 But I went to Corflu, which is the fancy advanced convention in Newbury,

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
 the weekend before Easter and had a fantastic time,

112
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,600
 including a trip out of Woking to see all of the HD Wells stuff there.

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,480
 And it was all very nice and well done to Dave Hodsen and crew for organising it.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,560
 But because I've put something on the cover,

115
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
 I thought I wanted to say a little bit about it,

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 which is that I made the fan awards for this year's Corflu,

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,320
 the fan awards have given for fanzine activity.

118
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,120
 You have to be quite a restricted definition of fanzine to win one of those,

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,200
 and we've poked fun at that a bit in the past.

120
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,560
 But as I was making the awards or getting the awards ordered,

121
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,920
 I thought I'd better order a sample one to see if they were okay.

122
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,640
 And that features on our cover this episode.

123
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,240
 So this is not a real fan award we did not win a fan award.

124
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,800
 We cannot win fan awards because we are specifically mentioned in the

125
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,720
 write-up of the fan awards as a thing that is not eligible for them.

126
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,760
 And people do keep voting for us, which is flattering,

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,920
 but probably not necessary anymore.

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,080
 Yeah, because Alison made us our own Knockoff fan award,

129
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,840
 so we don't need a real one anymore.

130
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,520
 Yeah, we've got a knockoff one.

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,120
 I'm probably going to stick it to the fanfons auction.

132
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,160
 For next Easter, or into the fanfons extravaganza next weekend.

133
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
 Next weekend.

134
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,440
 Next Easter, because we're going to be having an auction,

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,040
 a silent auction, a table, a tabola, a direct sales, and God knows what next year.

136
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,240
 I think it's quite nice.

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,720
 So now you've filmed me with the dilemma of do I have to go and bid on it in the fanfons auction.

138
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,520
 Day here.

139
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
 Well done Alison.

140
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
 Currently on my mantelpiece.

141
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,000
 It's almost as good as when John donated the R2D to me a cat to the fanfons auction,

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,120
 and I then bought it.

143
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,920
 Yeah.

144
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
 Okay, that's probably enough about Corfley, right?

145
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,640
 Yes.

146
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:20,960
 Yes.

147
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:29,520
 So we just wanted to bring up that locus.

148
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,160
 I've started their 2025 fundraiser.

149
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,520
 If you're a person who likes to go and contribute to fundraisers,

150
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,680
 they do a bunch of nice novels and zoos' authors and other stuff on offer,

151
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,000
 and their logo is pretty cute and you can buy merch.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,560
 I did go and compare their 2025 fundraiser to the 2024 fundraiser,

153
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,200
 because I was interested in the amount of money that they were looking for.

154
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,320
 And based on comparing those two, locus' revenue is flat,

155
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,800
 but their costs are up 21%, and they are trying to make that up by having a bigger

156
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,640
 crowd funner. And I know we've talked about locus before and the sustainability,

157
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,400
 but it worries me that if they've had a 21% increase in one year and their revenue is basically flat,

158
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
 that this is obviously not infinitely sustainable,

159
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,240
 because you're going to get to a point where you're trying to get like,

160
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,400
 you know, at this point they're trying to get over $300,000 from a fundraiser,

161
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,800
 which is like higher than any of the semi-prosines.

162
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
 I think that do these kinds of fundraisers, and I think they are risking getting to a point where

163
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,040
 like the fundraiser is half their costs, and that's not only tricky to do,

164
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,760
 but it's not an income you can rely on.

165
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,240
 Yeah, I think ultimately we speak from a position of love, we want locus to carry on going.

166
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,320
 We've said, broadly speaking, he said this before, but the main concern here is that if they don't

167
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,400
 do something to work out how they can be sustainable, they are going to go away.

168
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:59,040
 And I am not, I remain unconvinced that this is the way they should go, but they are continuing,

169
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,120
 so I wish them good luck, and we will put a link in the show notes.

170
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,080
 Is that fair?

171
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,640
 I don't think I have anything more to say.

172
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,600
 Quick, think of an opinion.

173
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,960
 Print magazines, all print magazines are struggling at the moment,

174
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,520
 and have to do a lot of work to continue to be relevant in the world we live in.

175
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,560
 I'm not sure locus is putting in that work, and I think we said, I said this the last time.

176
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,520
 Are they struggling?

177
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,320
 I mean, someone has just bought Azimovs an analogue and FNSF to bundle them all up into one company,

178
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,240
 and either they think they're failing businesses and expect to make no money,

179
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
 or they're actually doing okay?

180
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,800
 Difficult to tell.

181
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,120
 Yes.

182
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:51,040
 In between recording this episode and the episode releasing, the Arthur C. Clark award

183
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:59,840
 shortlist 2025 was announced, and the books on that shortlist are Private Rights by Julia Armfield,

184
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,400
 The Ministry of Time by Calli Ann Bradley, Extremophile by Ian Green,

185
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:12,240
 Annie Bot by Sierra Greer, Service Model by Adrian Tchaikovsky, and 13 Ways to Kill Lula Bel Rock by

186
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,440
 Maud Wolf. That shortlist was constructed by this year's judging panel, which includes me,

187
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,960
 and Dolly Garland, Gene Rowe, Nick Clark and Glenn Morgan, and the winner is going to be announced

188
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,440
 on the 25th of June, which is a Wednesday. So we will probably talk about that in a future episode,

189
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,000
 but I wanted to record this little drop-in for you listeners so that you knew what was up back to the show.

190
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,520
 We are aware that we need to talk about the recent Belfast East Kong, because we have not talked about

191
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,800
 it enough, and we are also aware that there is some other news happening that we haven't really

192
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,600
 discussed in any detail. Today we're mostly going to be talking about the Seattle controversy,

193
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,160
 but just to highlight one piece of news that we haven't discussed yet. Chris Barkley is suing

194
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,040
 Dave McCarthy and has written two articles on file 770 about that, so we've linked them both

195
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:17,120
 in the show notes, and we will discuss this in more detail as and when a resolution is reached.

196
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,080
 Right, is it time for the main course? It's time to discuss Seattle. Shall I attempt to

197
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:30,160
 summarise the past week of Seattle stuff in 90 seconds or less? Yes, please Liz, good luck.

198
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,600
 I'm just going to caveat that by saying, first off, that Alison, John and I are all

199
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,840
 current Seattle Worldcon staff. That is our current declared interest. Still Seattle Worldcon staff.

200
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,160
 Still, yes. So, what happened with Seattle Worldcon? On April 30th, when I was still recovering

201
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,200
 from like Jetlag and East Kong hangovers, the Worldcon put out a statement saying they'd had

202
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,960
 questions about the use of AI tools in their vetting process for program participants,

203
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,320
 and they tried to explain that they did use chat GPT to try and automate some of the online

204
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,360
 searches they do for participant vetting, and that it saved lots of time and they think it was more

205
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,240
 accurate. Many people were not pleased with this statement because it doesn't contain an apology

206
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,600
 or really a lot of detail other than kind of we did this and we think it's good. So then on May

207
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,520
 2nd, there was an apology saying we did this and no, it wasn't good. Sorry. That was obviously

208
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,360
 like an interim statement they put out. And then on May 6th, there was a second much longer statement

209
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,440
 from the chair addressing, you know, the one instance where they had used chat GPT, apologizing to

210
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,440
 everyone that they had harmed, and then kind of a long statement at the end from one of the program

211
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,200
 team. I think they had the division head from program yet explaining exactly how and why they

212
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,960
 had used the chat GPT and gives them like the exact prompts and what they did. In between

213
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,200
 those last two statements, there was also a statement saying that the WISVIS division head

214
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,680
 huger administration deputy huger administrator, Cassedine Eclisoye, and S. McAlum Stewart,

215
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,560
 Heinrich Lissen Ester resigned from their roles at the 2025 Worldcon because they don't see a path

216
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,760
 forward to making a contribution and saying that they hadn't used, you know, LLMs in any part of

217
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,040
 the huger award process. So I think the first thing to note is that the spectrum of opinions on

218
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:28,080
 AI usage of the podcast is quite wide from Alison, who is quite a lot more pro than I am and Liz,

219
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,400
 who is in the middle. As usual. And we're not going to get much into that. I think that having

220
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,920
 been on the internet and talked to members of the community and seen, you know, people discussing

221
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,080
 this over the last couple of years, I think even if you think chat GPT is great, it was reasonably

222
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,600
 obvious that the use of chat GPT coming out was going to go down poorly with a sizable segment

223
00:14:51,600 --> 00:15:00,240
 of the community. And I think that even if chat GPT was a great tool that saved a lot of effort and

224
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,000
 was entirely perfect for this use case, it was still probably not worth the amount of goodwill

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,400
 Seattle lost to use it. I am much more pro AI than either of the other two. I don't think we can

226
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,880
 get into much of why that is. But even from a position of AI's got quite a lot to offer,

227
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,600
 I think this was a particularly cloth headed use of it. And although I agree with John that it

228
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,640
 should have been obvious it wasn't going to go down very well. It clearly wasn't obvious to

229
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,000
 people in the Seattle team up to and including the chair at the point where they issued the

230
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,360
 first statement, because they clearly thought that the first statement would settle it down.

231
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,200
 And I just have a quote from Douglas Adams here, which is, "This has made a lot of people very

232
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,120
 angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move. I think it has made a lot of people very angry

233
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,000
 and has been widely regarded as a bad move." Yes, I mean, I think the thing is, I'm a little

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,600
 bit more pro AI I think than John, because I have used it to kind of manipulate some incredibly

235
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,760
 tedious kind of data cleaning and reorganizing stuff that it is quite good at. But that is usually

236
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,480
 taking something which is totally public and then asking chat GPT to reform up the results for me.

237
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,360
 And not, for instance, taking the names of program participants who have applied in a process that

238
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,200
 is not like completely open and then saying, "Can you tell me if there are any scandals about them

239
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,720
 specifically about racism and homophobia?" At that point, I think you go, "Is this a thing I should

240
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,040
 be asking chat GPT?" Even if you thought it was okay at some things like, "This is a specific case

241
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,360
 where you really should be ringing some alarm bells." I may have moved on to the next bit, sorry.

242
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,680
 No, I think that's right, because the next bit is the statements and apologies, where I did say a

243
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,760
 little bit about that before. I mean, the other thing I think is obvious when the first statement

244
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,880
 is that whoever had, you know, presumably someone has raised these concerns and you would think that

245
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,920
 someone raising the concerns would make people, you know, people who are putting out these statements

246
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,800
 say, "Hmm, is this person way out on one side of the debate and that's going to be the only

247
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,160
 like the sending voice we have?" Or should it make you think, "Hmm, actually maybe this is a

248
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,080
 harbinger of the weight of the internet dropping down our head, which is to come?" I understand that

249
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,560
 that there were concerns raised internally and that that led to some considerable debate internally.

250
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,880
 Clearly, Kathy and Sonny Jim started off thinking that it was, it was that the time saved was worth

251
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,640
 the effort and I think the internet has demonstrated that that's probably not the case because they

252
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,680
 probably spent quite a lot of time trying to sort it out now. I think the second statement was

253
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,040
 actually fine. It was a holding statement that said, "Oh no, we're sorry and we're going to take

254
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,360
 the time to do it." Hairs were running pretty wild at that point. I think it was really important

255
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,680
 to get an interim statement out and they did that. I think that first, so the first statement was

256
00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:00,080
 clearly, I think, not an apology and probably massively underestimating the reaction that would

257
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,320
 happen. The second, the apology and response from Chair on the second of May is very good.

258
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,880
 Kathy directly apologizes for the use of chat GBT, apologizes, well, says that she regrets

259
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,320
 releasing their first statement and acknowledges her mistake and says she is truly horrid for the

260
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:26,800
 harm it caused and it's like, "Yes, she has apologized directly and actively for both things

261
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:33,360
 as the chair and that is good." And then the third statement goes into the detail. But I think the

262
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:41,440
 apology was already in place on the second of May. The third statement is going into the actual

263
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,800
 actions that will be taken as a result and the thing that actually happened for which they are

264
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,720
 apologizing. And so the third statement is less of an apology and more a damage report almost.

265
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,120
 But I do think at this point, the chair and in that third statement, the division head

266
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,880
 have both actively apologized for the use of chat GBT and the chair has also apologized

267
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,320
 for that first statement. And so, I think that is good to see those things happening.

268
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
 We're being awfully moderate for what we want.

269
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,360
 Being super sedate. Well, I think because I think it's not wrong. I want to carry on being

270
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,640
 Hugo finalist liaison really. I don't think it's, I want to continue working in the division. I don't

271
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,840
 want to try and undermine where it's got to. I would like all of the wisps parts of Seattle to

272
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,560
 to go as smoothly as possible. I guess one more thing which is to follow on from what I said before.

273
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,000
 What I think is interesting is that I can't tell whether there is a genuine divide between

274
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,960
 Bandomat-Large and its opinions on chat GBT and the ones who are working on Seattle and their

275
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,560
 opinions on chat GBT or if it's just the balance of opinions and in the early phase, certain ones

276
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,240
 carried more weight than others. But it is interesting. I think if you have a bunch of volunteers

277
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
 who are maybe trying to make their lives easier and see these tools as more acceptable,

278
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,160
 and that's out of step with how the community is majority feeling. I've seen many more people

279
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,800
 saying, "No, this is a nothing you should do than people saying, 'Yeah, this is a great idea.'"

280
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:26,640
 I do wonder whether there is some division between people who are either retired or work entirely

281
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,640
 for themselves, e.g. freelance creatives and people who work in large organizations because

282
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,760
 the impression I get is that a lot of jobs in large organizations are making increasing use of

283
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,640
 AI tools in their daily work. So we may be seeing a split there between people who are working on

284
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 the back end of Seattle who are using these tools professionally and certainly the creatives and

285
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,400
 largely the creatives who have been absolutely adamant that this was a terrible idea.

286
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,040
 Well, I also think we're seeing the disconnect between the people from whom the work has been

287
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,560
 stolen and the people from whom it has not. And it turns out I think category A is more angry and

288
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,680
 that isn't really surprising. Because for instance, all my scientific papers are available open access

289
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,920
 because that's how you should do science. But it does mean that if someone decides to use them,

290
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,440
 I don't get a say in that because I signed my right to it away. I have never written anything which is

291
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,840
 sort of copywritable in a different sense. And so yeah, I am not as angry. This is not as personal

292
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,200
 and affront to me as it would be if my books were in these training sets without permission.

293
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,000
 And I think that's the other thing which is this is very personal for those people. Understandably

294
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,880
 so I think. Johnny, your fans in the creative commons licensed. Yeah. Okay. Because I mean,

295
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,160
 I am positive that my papers are like John's inner training data sets and work because that's

296
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,040
 what I say I'm not for. But I also suspect that blog posts of mine are scraped and inner training

297
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,000
 data set. Yeah, I mean, I think the stuff that you've just written on the internet. But I'm not very

298
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,320
 good writer. So they're welcome to that. Well, that's the other thing, right? I don't have a

299
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,160
 professional interest in my Twitter. It's true. I'm not earning any money from my writing or my

300
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,240
 podcasting. Yeah. And that means that my opinion on this will be different. And I think I think I

301
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,760
 am trying. I don't want to make it sound like I think that's unreasonable. I think, you know, if

302
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,800
 this is your job and someone is stealing work you have done for your livelihood that you are deeply

303
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,680
 creatively invested in, that must be absolutely fucking infuriating. And I'm not going to tell anyone

304
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,760
 that they can't be angry about it because that seems out of step. So I do make my income

305
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:45,280
 for another few weeks. Shortly, most of my income will be my pension. But I do make my income such

306
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:52,880
 as it is from my art. And it all has been routinely stolen, not by being used for training material,

307
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,560
 but just stolen because that's how the t-shirt industry in particular works, repeatedly and

308
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,440
 consistently the entire time I've done it, along with everybody else who works in this space.

309
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,920
 And we just kind of suck it up. Many of the places that the theft is happening are countries

310
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,960
 where they don't have a copyright law that is anything like what we're used to in Europe and

311
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:21,520
 America. So although I understand that that is a terrible, you know, the theft of material is

312
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,840
 terrible. That theft of material is happening in lots of different spaces, not just this one.

313
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,800
 Yes, and were you to be angry about it, I would support you.

314
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,840
 I've given up anger, John.

315
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,800
 The other thing I would say is I did see some debate about saying, oh, well, if they were logged

316
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,640
 in, they use chat bbt for zero or whatever. And that's a different training set and maybe it doesn't

317
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,960
 contain as much material. And of course, what I discover is it's very difficult to verify that

318
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,240
 one because chat bbt will tell you it is trained on industry standard machine learning data sets.

319
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,880
 But it won't tell you what an industry standard machine learning data set is.

320
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,440
 So if you assume it's the same as meta who downloaded a giant pilot books off the internet,

321
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,840
 then it's definitely got them in. But if there is some like repository of standardized machine

322
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,320
 learning data sets that don't contain copyright material, then it's trained on something different.

323
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,760
 But then of course, I guess you say, even if chat gbt for zero is not maybe previous versions were

324
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,680
 trained on it. And so it has been implicitly used in the building on them. But I thought it was

325
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,320
 interesting that I can't definitely verify like, is my stuff in chat gbt for zero?

326
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,560
 I'm wary of getting too much into this. But the other thing is obviously if chat gbt has

327
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,680
 demonstrated to for instance, stack overflow, that they can either have their content scraped

328
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,120
 with no compensation unlicensed, or have their content scraped licensed and with compensation,

329
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,720
 is that chat gbt? Like it may well be that chat gbt has now basically gone to enough

330
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,160
 companies in the middle, like, well, now we will pay you. And if you don't say, yes, we're going to do

331
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,600
 it anyway. And it's like, does that make it okay? I don't want to get into that because I think we've

332
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,280
 spent an hour on whether that's okay. But what I will say is I can see, I can see again, how a

333
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,000
 creative might be justifiably concerned that that does not make it all hunky-dory. Going back to

334
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,080
 the statement that was made by on the sixth made by the chair and the division head of program,

335
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,480
 I thought this statement was good for two reasons, which is firstly, it goes into detail on what

336
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,040
 exactly happened, which I think is good. But secondly, it commits to five concrete actions

337
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,280
 that will be done as a result of this thing. And I think Liz talked about these already

338
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,320
 in her introduction, but they're going to redo the work that use chat gbt. They're going to bring

339
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,200
 outside members of the community who have worked in World Compromor programming to come in and

340
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,160
 perform an audit. They're going to allow partial or full refunds of memberships from members.

341
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,800
 They're going to reevaluate their communication methods internally and externally, and they're

342
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,840
 going to explore options for providing additional oversight and guidance to the chair and leadership

343
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,080
 team. And that's going to be finalized in the in a meeting, which is going to happen in the coming

344
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,480
 week. I think four and five are a bit woolly. I think but that's tricky because I think they

345
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,560
 probably need to be a bit woolly because they need to be ongoing things. But the first three

346
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,440
 things are very concrete. I think and they're very good. I think I think they are concrete

347
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,360
 things that the convention can do to make the situation better in so far as it can be made better

348
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,320
 and they are kind of actionable outcomes. What do you think?

349
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,240
 I think it's interesting, but they basically, one of the things saying we're taking everything

350
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,520
 we do with chat gbt and redoing it with volunteers, you know, so human labor. And that's interesting

351
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,480
 because at this point, I think Seattle have already told lots of people that they are on program.

352
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,040
 And they have a page of people appearing on the Seattle program. So say that chat gpt gave them

353
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,560
 a false negative. It flagged someone as being fine to be on program. And then a human volunteer

354
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,120
 goes through and does the checks and discovers actually we think this person probably should not

355
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,880
 have been given the okay to be on program and they have to disinvite them. That's going to be a

356
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,520
 very interesting process. I think they're good concrete actions, but I do think they're concrete

357
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,880
 actions where the program process is really a long way along at this point. And so

358
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,000
 they report on their recommendations. It's nice to have this, but if their recommendation is

359
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,560
 you use chat gpt to do this thing and we recommend that you don't do that. They've already done that.

360
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,400
 If they recommend any like other giant changes that they think are problems in the process,

361
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,360
 it kind of depends on what the problem in the process is. Is it something that can actually be

362
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,040
 changed? Or is this actually something where, you know, we're now doing a learning exercise for

363
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,800
 learning more about what future world cons can do, except we're going to do it in a very public way

364
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,760
 and put report out that everyone can then also have 27,000 opinions on. So I'm kind of in two

365
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,280
 minds about that. That's fair. I think the audit statement is there so that people who are worrying,

366
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,360
 you know, what else does this imply and what else might they have done wrong,

367
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,840
 have some reassurance that if something else is wrong, it comes out and is dealt with.

368
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,640
 And I appreciate that like working out what you can change if there is something rotten

369
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,400
 is probably difficult. I will say though, I suspect my suspicion is nothing else is rotten.

370
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,240
 And so the audit will just find that this was a mistake and that everything else is basically

371
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,960
 working the same as most other world cons. I mean, and I hope that that's right. But we will see.

372
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,800
 Yeah, it's basically, I mean, I think also at this point, it's like, if this is to regain trust in

373
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,600
 the program division, then it's probably a bit late. If you don't trust the program division at this

374
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,040
 point, you're probably better off with going with point three and getting a full or partial refund

375
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,400
 rather than appear on tell program. I don't know. I don't know why I want to say about this, but I

376
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,080
 guess what I will say is I time to take your point. But I think you do what you can, right?

377
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,080
 You can let the community come in and inspect the way you've been doing things to work out whether

378
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,440
 it was okay, except for this one thing. And so you can do that. And like, you can't go back in

379
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,960
 time and not do the thing. And so they can't commit to do that. But they can commit as far as they can

380
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,400
 to basically saying we're going to excise the bits that people have a problem with. We're going to

381
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,720
 make sure the rest of the process is accountable as it possibly can be. And anyone who feels that

382
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,440
 the first two things are not good enough can choose not to come. And I don't think I see what

383
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,080
 more they could have done. I think this is basically them doing as much as they can to establish

384
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,600
 much transparency as they can in, you know, the framework of linear time. I think they've said

385
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,240
 rather too much here, this statement should be shorter and clearer and just apologized and got

386
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,240
 out of there. But you know, clearly people like the fact it's a long statement. So, you know,

387
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,920
 but also that's what they did. They did that on the second of May. If you wanted that statement

388
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,400
 that was released four days earlier, this is the detailed statement for people who wanted the detail.

389
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,400
 Yes. So the only thing I would have done differently is we won't is the first one had said we did

390
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,600
 this wrong. It was stupid. We're very sorry. We won't do it again. And they're not said,

391
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,040
 oh, and we're going to come back with more information. And yes, people would have said,

392
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,480
 yeah, give us more, give us more, but they would have, it would have died down.

393
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,120
 I do think it's good to have concrete steps they are taking, even if, you know, I may

394
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,280
 would not have written exactly the same steps they're taking, but that's because I'm a different person.

395
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,120
 What? I know. I'm not in charge of everything, John. Sometimes hard to believe.

396
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,120
 Outrageous. Shortly before the second part of the statement was released, the division head for

397
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,560
 Wispers Cassidy and the Hugo Administrator and Deputy Hugo Administrator Nicholas White and

398
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,720
 Esteba Calum Stewart resigned. What do we think about that as three people who were working in

399
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,120
 the Wispers division at the time? And I'm still working in the Wispers division as far as I know.

400
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,840
 And are all still working in the Wispers division? My point being that you didn't start after that

401
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,400
 happened rather than that you have stopped now. All right, John, I'm going on about linear time again.

402
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,760
 I'm obsessed with linear time, Liz. We are not party and we're not party to the things that caused

403
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,720
 them to resign in detail. And in fact, we couldn't have been because we didn't know they'd resigned

404
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,200
 until they'd done it. They did say sorry for that, but it was a bit annoying. They have apologized.

405
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,200
 We still love you, Nicholas and Esteba. It's all right. And Cassidy, that was very annoying.

406
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,880
 Yeah, it was, I was, it was a bit of a shock to wake up in the morning and find that everyone

407
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,120
 above me in the division had resigned overnight. And I found out about it from a statement on

408
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:31,200
 blue sky. We had had a little, we'd had a precursor because they sent us a note to discord.

409
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:40,400
 No, no, we hadn't. You had Alison and I had lizard had nothing. Yeah, John and I had had a note saying

410
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,720
 they were considering their positions because I have worked in the sorts of large organizations

411
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,520
 quite a lot. Have you you heard the minister say that he is considering his position? Yes.

412
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:58,240
 I interpreted that as they are. I'm not sure if John thought it meant they could. I thought

413
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,360
 it probably meant they were gearing up to resign, but I must admit I thought they'd probably

414
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,040
 share the resignation statement with us before Facebook. Yes. It's also, I think,

415
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,200
 important to note that you two are the Hugo fineless liaisons. So as soon as this happens,

416
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,920
 you are going to get Hugo finalists asking lots of questions. Whereas I am just a Hugo

417
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,320
 data minion person. And so no one's going to come and ask me questions about what's going on.

418
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,520
 We've had relatively few. We've had a couple, but not really. I think, no, but the reason we

419
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,200
 haven't had many is because we posted in the Hugo finalist discord saying we found out about

420
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,960
 this at the same time as you did and we don't know anything. And that probably limited to the

421
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,040
 questions we received on account of how people read it. And then, oh, they're not going to be

422
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,240
 useful, are they? And the answer is no, no, we're not. Sorry, Hugo finalists. We're trying.

423
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:52,640
 Yes. So I don't understand this move, if I am honest, because the statements are probably

424
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,440
 imperfect in the way that all statements are, but certainly seem in general to apologize and to

425
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,960
 make concrete commitments to future action. And so I don't understand what needed to be in these

426
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,000
 that was a resignation issue. I think I will say. I think the thing where I would say that the

427
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,240
 statement could have been better worded is because the statement does not say exactly why the three

428
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,680
 whispers administration division had resigned. It led to a lot of speculation on the internet.

429
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,560
 You mean the statement that the resignation statement from whispers rather than the statement from the

430
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,880
 chat? Yes. So it led to a lot of speculation about, you know, even though they said no LLM's

431
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,040
 agenda survey, I've been using the Hugo process at any stage. It led to a lot of people speculating

432
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,720
 that was going on. It led to people speculating that there's something rotten in the Hugo's. It

433
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,040
 led to people speculating that all kinds of other things would have happened. And I don't think

434
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,200
 the statement was intended to spark a lot of, you know, debate about where these things have been

435
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,240
 using the logos. But basically when I see lots of people commenting saying, Oh, I wonder if this

436
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,840
 process that I was directly involved in use LLM's then it's like a bit like one, you didn't read the

437
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,000
 statement and two, maybe the statement does not make it clear enough what the situation is. So I

438
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,400
 think obviously it's hard for us to know exactly all that is going on and why people do not, as I

439
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,400
 say, do not see a path forward that enables them to make future contributions. But I do think there

440
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,960
 is always like a balance like a world call is a group of people. And the committee even is a group

441
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,480
 of people who have to make collective decisions. And you will very rarely agree with all of them.

442
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,560
 And some of them you will disagree with so strongly that they are a resigning matter.

443
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,040
 And some of them you might not. And so I think it's basically a case of everyone's kind of personal

444
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,560
 calibration of that. And maybe in this situation, I would have just been like, well, I don't fully

445
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,000
 agree with everything. But I'm never going to agree with 100% of everything. Whereas they felt

446
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,280
 this was a very strongly that they wanted to resign over it. I understand that Cassidy,

447
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,880
 Nicholas and Esther felt that they needed to resign and that the internal discussions,

448
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,120
 which as I've said, none of us approve you to, had got to a point where they didn't think they

449
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:02,000
 could carry on. It's not obvious to me what caused that. I think the sudden resignation,

450
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,360
 though of course they are remaining. They have helped a little with the transfer has left

451
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:13,360
 Wussfuss division, which is quite a sensitive part of the world gone quite understaffed. And

452
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,560
 it's going to be a big task now for for Catherine and Rosemarita to step up to their new roles.

453
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,520
 I don't know if we've said yet. Catherine Duvall is taking over as Wussfuss division head and

454
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,440
 Rosemary Park, who is the existing deputy division head for site selection is also going to be

455
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,800
 deputy Hugo administration. Catherine will be Hugo administrator. And as one of the staff in the

456
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,880
 division, I'm concerned that that's going to leave us in quite a difficult state if anything else

457
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,120
 happens in any of the areas that Wussfuss is responsible for. I understand that resignation

458
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,760
 and the threat of resignation is one of the things that you can use as a negotiating tool

459
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,640
 in these sorts of difficult circumstances. But it is difficult for everyone around in a

460
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,680
 star in the staff. We also wanted to talk a little bit about programme and the way it's done.

461
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,920
 Way that the programme was done at Seattle is 30 track leads asked, were asked to select people

462
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,920
 who they wanted to invite onto the programme. And then applicants recommended for participation

463
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,000
 were moved on to the vetting process in which they were vetted to see if there's anything

464
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,560
 that might disqualify them. And so basically they're looking for actions that would go against

465
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:32,560
 the Convention Code of Conduct and anti racism statement, which is basically saying, if we think

466
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,120
 that you are going to be a problem for our convention, if we put you on programme, we would like you

467
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:43,280
 not to be on programme, please, which is relatively, I think, fair. The people who have received

468
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:51,040
 declines at this point were people who were not selected by the programme track leads in that

469
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,880
 first phase. The discourse on the internet has largely been like, how normal is it for this thing

470
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:04,080
 to be done based on the track leads, recommending people to be on the programme, and then the vetting

471
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:10,080
 being done afterwards. And I think the answer here is interesting, because I've seen two basically

472
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,760
 contrary or seemingly opposing views, whether I've been people saying it's outrageous that the

473
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:23,440
 track leads are using their own experience of the people that are applying to put them on programme,

474
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,760
 and then there are people saying it's outrageous that people are being put on programme if the

475
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,800
 track leads don't know who they are, and the track leads should know everyone who they're

476
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,840
 putting on programme. And I think the answer is in the middle, I suspect track leads are aware of

477
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,040
 people that they want to be on programme, because they're aware of the field that they're working in,

478
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:46,000
 but I also suspect that people who have filled in that survey are sort of inviting some of those

479
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,480
 people who have applied to appear on panel items as a result of filling in those surveys. And that's

480
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,960
 so track leads based, there are decisions to invite panelists on the content of panelists application,

481
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,560
 the track leads knowledge of the applicant and the subject area, and additional input from other

482
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,720
 members of the programme team, which is basically, we look at your application to see if it's good,

483
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,800
 if we know you're quite good, that also probably feeds into our decision, and if someone else on the

484
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,880
 team knows you're quite good, that also probably feeds into the decision. I think that's pretty

485
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,960
 reasonable. Yeah, I think that's pretty standard. Yeah, good. I mean, the reason this is done is

486
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,960
 because you have more people who want to be on programme than you can have on programme. You

487
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,520
 want to be able to tell people who are definitely on programme that they'll definitely on programme,

488
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,360
 so that they can then, if being on programme is contingent on,

489
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,920
 that if the appearance at the convention is contingent on being on programme,

490
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,120
 which I feel is also a little more common in the US because you might get your membership

491
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,120
 reimbursed for being on multiple programme items, then you need to tell the millionaire for them

492
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,360
 to make that decision. And if someone is not going to be on programme, then you kind of owe it to

493
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,280
 them to tell them that we don't think we have a space to use on programme. And then if they feel

494
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,360
 okay, it's not worth me going to the con, then they can make that decision. And this feels like

495
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,400
 a fairly standard way of doing it. Like, you can't, you can't rely entirely on knowledge because

496
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,640
 the world can't, you don't know everyone. And you can't really rely entirely on surveys because

497
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,360
 sometimes people who are great on programme might be terrible at filling out survey,

498
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,480
 or they might be incredibly busy because they're incredibly great and they're launching a book

499
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,880
 and they didn't have time to write a massive essay. So you kind of use a thing where it's like,

500
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,000
 you're like, okay, do you think you can use any of these people on programme? And then if you

501
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,560
 get someone who you say, okay, well, this is like a five time Hugo World finalists and no one says

502
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,440
 they use them on programme, oh, it's probably because they didn't do very much in the form,

503
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,920
 you might then kind of have a second look and make sure you want to use them. I think the only

504
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,080
 thing that's different this year from kind of that sort of hybrid approach that I have known in

505
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,200
 previous years is that sometimes you do the checking for whether they've said anything that

506
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,680
 makes you think they'll break the code of conduct before you pass their names on to track leads.

507
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,840
 And sometimes you do it the other way around. I think Worldcom programming is incredibly

508
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:58,720
 complicated and really quite tricky to get right. I am surprised by the suggestion that

509
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:06,320
 use of Chatty PTA saved hundreds of hours of volunteer time because it seems somewhat unlikely

510
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:12,800
 to me that as lots of people have said, you could write a script to do the sorts of things it was

511
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,760
 doing. You could ask Chatty PTA to write a script as somebody jokingly and perhaps save the same

512
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,440
 time without needing to use generative AI. And the other thing that I wanted to comment on is that

513
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,160
 at least one person has said, oh, I was talking to a track lead about a programme item and then

514
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,800
 got a got a statement saying that I'd been rejected from the programme by the programme lead or by

515
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,760
 somebody else in the programme division, not the track lead I was working with. And they went on to

516
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,160
 say that must have been because of AI and I suspect it was because they were known to be

517
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:55,120
 somebody who's difficult on panels, but I like to speculate. But even then, like, we were approached

518
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,840
 about programme items at Glasgow that didn't end up happening. And I mean, I mean, obviously

519
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,720
 Alison is incredibly difficult on programme, but me and Liz are delightful. So I think there are

520
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,040
 reasons that people might be talking to a track lead and then not end on programme that are

521
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,520
 completely innocent. Because as I think the statement says, or I've heard somewhere, it's

522
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,840
 something like a third of all of the people. There's just not enough room to put them on programme.

523
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:24,080
 And so you have a reasonably good chance of not ending up on programme, even if you're quite good.

524
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:32,400
 And that sucks. It does suck. But also it's reflective of how many people want to be on panels

525
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,960
 and the restrictions here. And there's also a thing here, which is obviously the more,

526
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,440
 I think in the old days, sort of going back to when I started in front of them, it was very much

527
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,920
 done on the, well, such and such as the track lead and knows these people and will invite them to

528
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,200
 be on programme model. And I do like that we've moved to a more hybrid approach where we try and

529
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,080
 seek more information about who might be good, because there are, firstly, people who might be

530
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,760
 very good at being programme area heads who do not have the personal network. And it helps those

531
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,960
 people and gives them that chance. But it also helps people who are new to the community and who

532
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,080
 might not have the kind of the personal network in fandom, but might be absolutely amazing on a

533
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:18,480
 panel. And so I do think in general, the community has gotten much better at how we approach

534
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:25,680
 potential programme participants. And I'm certainly not longing for going back to the way it was.

535
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,600
 Yeah. So I think a lot of the comments I've seen are the process for how this works is not clear.

536
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:37,440
 I think Glasgow had a much clearer statement on how the process worked. I made it more clear

537
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,920
 what the different stages were. But I think the thing is, right, if you reject someone because

538
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,640
 you think they're going to break the code of conduct, you absolutely can't tell them we're

539
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,760
 rejecting you because we think you're going to break the code of conduct. But that does leave a

540
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,720
 bunch of people now not sure. I think the other issue is that if you're talking to a track lead,

541
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,160
 it can depend. If the track leads approach you and said we absolutely want to do this item,

542
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,400
 it would be brilliant. We want you on it. Then that's one thing. But that can, it could also be

543
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,320
 that you approach the track leads to say how about this item and they were originally

544
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,400
 keen and then they realised it would actually be way more work and we don't have the tech for it

545
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,040
 or something. And that's how you get rejected. I think the third thing I might just say is that

546
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,880
 there's usually a mismatch between the items the con wants to put on and the people they have to

547
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,520
 put on the items because the con wants to do a balanced programme and not have a ton of items

548
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,080
 in certain areas that lots of people want to be on. And I would say there's a lot of people who

549
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,280
 would like to be on kind of like the techniques of writing panels or the business of writing panels

550
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,520
 or how to get published and that kind of thing because I think they're quite good. They're always

551
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,080
 something you can do if you're fairly new in the business and they seem like a great thing to kind

552
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,360
 of go for. But I think if you ran as many panels as you wanted on like how to get published with

553
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,800
 the number of people who want to be on them, your con would be like 10% how to get published.

554
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,720
 That's it. Like if you say you would like to be on panels about anime, then you will probably end

555
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,080
 upon as many panels as you would like because that's where we are underrepresented. So you

556
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,480
 it does if you really want to be on programme, I think one benefit can be can be a little bit

557
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,360
 flexible and say actually I would like to be on a wide range of stuff and then you'll probably find

558
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,120
 a spot that fits you. That's a bit of a a bit of a detail.

559
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:18,640
 I wanted to pull back a little bit to the vetting point which is that if it's taking hundreds,

560
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,680
 I mean more than hundreds of hours because hundreds of hours is only the time that was

561
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,520
 allegedly saved using chat GPT for the vetting process specifically. This is not to do with

562
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,880
 whether somebody would be good on panels or how good of fit they are compared to everything else,

563
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,080
 but for the vetting, making sure this person won't break the code of conduct, wouldn't it be better

564
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,040
 to just not do that? I mean obviously if you already know they're a loose stare, you don't put

565
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,520
 them on the programme but otherwise you give them the benefit of the doubt and you do not do

566
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,520
 hundreds of hours of research into it.

567
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,280
 I think that is one way to go. The one thing is that we've just talked about how kind of

568
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,160
 personal information and word of mouth does not always work and so we can't rely on it for that.

569
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,240
 The second thing is that the instant you put someone on a panel and they say something

570
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,240
 absolutely unacceptable and then someone says look if you looked at their Facebook page for

571
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,080
 one minute you would have known they would say this absolutely unacceptable thing, then you're in

572
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:17,040
 a big pile of trouble and your calm has done something that people do not find acceptable.

573
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,600
 This comes back to not having more programme than you can have where an individual has had

574
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,480
 taken responsibility for making that programme item app, doesn't it? And I know that everybody

575
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,680
 wants to be on programme. No, I don't see the connection you're making, please elaborate.

576
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:40,160
 I don't think there's a connection there. I think if you are arguing that the programme items that

577
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,280
 people put a lot of effort into can only have people, those people already know are safe,

578
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,920
 I disagree with that. I think the hundreds of hours statement in the statement is probably

579
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,000
 inaccurate because I'd be very surprised if it takes hundreds of hours to do this.

580
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,840
 But I don't think there is a disconnect between making good programme items and looking at people's

581
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:07,040
 Facebooks to make sure that they're not, you know, a wrong and necessary. Yeah.

582
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:13,360
 I think it is an exceptionally time consuming process given that you are right, like 99.9% of

583
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,440
 people who apply to be on programme will be fine and you will not see anything.

584
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,560
 So the question is, how many hours is it worth to flag up each of these people?

585
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,680
 But having done it, I would not underestimate the time it takes to actually do sort of a

586
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,360
 gather information from what public sources you can find on the internet and then go and

587
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,800
 report and spread to that you did it and there were no red flags. And then if you find someone

588
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,680
 where you do find something that you think, you know, other people need to check and verify with

589
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,400
 you and validate and make a decision, it takes quite a lot longer. So yeah.

590
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,440
 I do want to say the risk reward is the problem. Yeah.

591
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,080
 Because the reward for doing this work is that you don't have that

592
00:46:52,080 --> 00:47:00,400
 fire and like, especially now when almost every convention Glasgow was remarkably

593
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:08,240
 controversy free, but sort of Chengdu and DC and Seattle have all had massive controversies.

594
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,840
 You know, there is a lot of effort put in now to trying to avoid those controversies where

595
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,200
 possible if they're predictable and I can't blame conventions for putting that effort in.

596
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,320
 It's a thing that might come up that you know you can control a little bit and so we currently

597
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,560
 put a lot of volunteer hours into controlling it because there's lots of things that might

598
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,320
 become an issue at your con that you can't control and we don't always, you know, it's not like

599
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,480
 the things always come out of left field, but sometimes they come out of the same few areas and

600
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,840
 I think that is one of them is program participants who break the card of conduct on panels.

601
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,040
 Will cons are very hard and we very much appreciate the people who run them, especially at senior levels.

602
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:00,480
 Let's do picks. I want to pick sinners and I want to shout out Kat Korbetty who said, oh,

603
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,040
 this is on and you should see it is great and you should go and see it in the iMacs and I

604
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,880
 went and had a look at my iMacs, which is the BFI iMacs and discovered two things. First is

605
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,520
 that they were showing the 70 millimeter iMacs print film version of the movie and

606
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:23,840
 secondly that they were only showing it that day in the following day. So there i was at 1040 the

607
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,440
 following morning watching sinners because it didn't quite sell out but it was very close to

608
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,920
 being full as there's some terrible seats in our iMacs. Sinners is a film about two brothers who have

609
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:43,760
 been in Chicago and have returned to their hometown in Mississippi and a lad who plays the blues

610
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,080
 so well that he conjures the spirits of the past and future. I don't think that's a huge

611
00:48:50,080 --> 00:49:00,720
 spoiler because they say it like at the very beginning of the film and so the two brothers who

612
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,400
 are chances who are both played by Michael B Jordan extremely well want to set up a Duke joint

613
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:14,240
 and they do so and it turns out that all all is not well for a variety of reasons and all the

614
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,280
 sorts of stuff that you might expect to happen is a horror movie i guess but it's not very horrible

615
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,640
 it was a 15 rating and i was like that'll be okay i'll be able to cope with that but in fact

616
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,400
 it was completely fine and it didn't have any problems with it at all because as previously

617
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,880
 stated i am a horror was but what she's really about is well lots of things um the black experience

618
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,840
 in America music and its power to transform what it is to be tempted and what temptation might look

619
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,400
 like it's a fabulous film and you should all go and see it yeah but i mean a lot of you will have

620
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,080
 seen it because it's also an enormous hit i do i do want to i haven't got around to you i can't

621
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,560
 go into cinema until i know it sound like i'm dying occasionally so i haven't seen it in as

622
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:00,560
 or thunderbolts which is a bit sad boom shall i go next you shall so i want to pick this

623
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:06,240
 for the novelty that i am going to pick a roguelike puzzle video game that allison has not picked

624
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,960
 but i also feel bad because allison might now go and play it and then we won't see it for another

625
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:20,080
 six weeks so i'm going to pick blue prince which is uh it is a game about an inheritance you have

626
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:26,640
 inherited a manor house from your uncle the baron but you can only keep the manor house if you can

627
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,640
 and the whole inheritance if you can find the 46th room in the house and the way you find the rooms

628
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,560
 is you go into each room and each time you draft from a set of particular rooms and you're trying

629
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,880
 to build a pathway through the manor house using all these different rooms in order to

630
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,600
 basically get enough puzzle solves and enough kind of permanent power-ups and knowledge and

631
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,400
 information and so on in order that you can work out what you need to do on a particular day to

632
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,440
 find room 46 and every day everything resets so you know you'll you might spend one day deciding

633
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,480
 okay i'm going to unlock this mysterious room because i think it's got a clue to room 46 but actually

634
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,000
 the the drafts don't go your way so you decide oh never mind i'm going to spend this play through

635
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,720
 just trying to go to as many rooms as possible because that will help me solve another puzzle and

636
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:17,120
 you unpack more and more and i have in theory completed it because i have found an open room

637
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:23,200
 46 and know what it contains but actually i think if i was really dedicated this is about twice as

638
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,240
 much more content in the end game than i have played so far it's just that the puzzles have

639
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,640
 got to the point for me where they have got really quite complicated and i'm not sure i will get

640
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,560
 enough satisfaction out of solving them to bother solving them but there's so much hidden stuff

641
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,720
 it's like you know you go i went to a forum to be like you know it's like how am i supposed to

642
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,960
 solve this puzzle and it's like oh it's a room that i have not yet even seen and i've played

643
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,160
 24 days of this game with 30 rooms per day or something and things like that and then but also

644
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,120
 satisfaction of figuring out oh i can oh if i go to this room and i push this button and then i go

645
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,560
 back to this room and then i push this button and then i will go on and cover this whole extra thing

646
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:06,000
 is is really quite satisfying and it's quite nicely done it's all sort of like line art drawings

647
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,960
 and the rooms are themed by color to different uh different types of room and so on i've got

648
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,320
 some nice floaty music in the background and it all feels very simple to play but obviously

649
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,880
 complicated to remember i think i've got two and i've got two main criticisms and one is that you

650
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,080
 can't play it without writing lotus stuff down and i think that's by design but it's a bit of a throw

651
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,920
 back to be like now get your pen and paper out and write some information down that you will need

652
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,600
 later on and two it's a rogue like drafting game and so it's very random and so when i got to

653
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,680
 point where i was like right this is the puzzle i really need to solve i'd be like oh well i haven't

654
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,360
 drawn this room today so i've got to go and try another three days until i get the exact room i

655
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,120
 want next to this other exact room so i can solve this one particular puzzle and that's why i've sort

656
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,040
 of not completely stopped playing it but i'm now sort of casually doing a little bit at a time to

657
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,440
 see if i can finish some of the end game stuff but it was surprising i hadn't really heard about it

658
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,640
 and then i saw a post on a forum and then it turned out to be a PlayStation plus game and so i just

659
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:10,000
 gave it go and it is surprisingly fun hey arguably fantasy you know it sounds like it well i mean if

660
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,560
 the room keeps changing it's if the mansion keeps changing its shape that's definitely

661
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,680
 that's i doesn't change its shape it just changes the rooms within the shape anyway it is for PlayStation

662
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:27,760
 5 windows and Xbox so i may have saved Allison from myself i can play it using g-force now apparently

663
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:35,360
 in the cloud or crossover so i've been playing a game but it's a Hugo finalist and i got it in the

664
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,920
 Hugo photo packet so i haven't had a chance to look at what new stuff is out there because i

665
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,800
 be too busy playing Laura Lion's laser eyes oh yeah the Hugo photo packets out guys we've got to mention

666
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,440
 that oh we probably should have said something about the Hugo photo packet being out i think in

667
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,840
 the middle i think i think in the middle of picks at the end of pick number two is the perfect time

668
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,120
 to devote that information excellent um guys if you don't tend to listen to picks this is the

669
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:04,080
 point where we tell you the Hugo photo packet is out so if you're going to ask for a refund from

670
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:11,440
 Seattle i would suggest you download the Hugo photo packet before you do that oh okay oh i'd

671
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:20,000
 have to say that i mean i thought it was funny it's um it is quite funny as long as people don't

672
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,280
 think it's genuine advice well i mean i don't think you should i don't think you should um ask for a

673
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,440
 refund for Seattle i think Seattle will be a great con and they have done the best they could possibly

674
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:36,240
 do to repair the damage so yeah that's a serious thing just keep being a member of Seattle and also

675
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:42,480
 download the Hugo photo packet which has codes for four games is that right three games four games

676
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,640
 four games four plus tactical breech wizards has a demo and a demo and nobody's and nobody's heard

677
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,840
 anything from Nintendo for some reason i feel that so it should be i feel the Nintendo should be like

678
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,640
 enigmatic and mysterious and just like suddenly appear to drop new switches and things like that

679
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,200
 it is good that you feel that because that's indeed the case

680
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:10,160
 but also when you're thinking about your ballot for next year consider not

681
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,840
 nominating Nintendo games because they don't care now that that could be an ecumenical matter

682
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:24,000
 also i just want to say for people listening Liz said blueprints and i heard blueprints um yes

683
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,960
 so we might want to make clear that it is a prince who is blue i'm assuming there's a blue

684
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,600
 prince oh but is it that's all point it's upon oh because you're drafting blueprints for your house

685
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,840
 it's a rogue like puzzler whose name is upon alison oh okay i get it now it took a while but if

686
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:47,200
 you're googling for it you need to google for blue space prints yes fair enough but there is a link

687
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,000
 in the show notes or there will be although obviously you don't want to google for blue space space

688
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,760
 prints why not well because then you'd be googling for a space a prince from space who is blue and

689
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,000
 that is not what you meant god i see what you mean let's give you a look i'm googling i'm too busy

690
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:13,840
 to give you a look oh god how quickly can i get a ps5 i'm going to pick a book and i'm going to pick

691
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:22,800
 the mark by freeder iceberg translated by lorissa causa is this is a book set in near future recuivic

692
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:31,600
 and basically it's set in the run up to a referendum in iceland as to whether people will be forced to

693
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:40,160
 take a test known as the empathy test and mark themselves with their results and it's kind of a

694
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:49,360
 book about privilege and about government overreach and about good intentions and bad intentions and

695
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:56,320
 how how that all intersects and i thought it was it may be very angry in places it's a book that

696
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:02,240
 doesn't lead you to a neat answer which i very much enjoyed and yeah i would i would highly recommend

697
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,360
 people check it out it's very lovely um lovely is the wrong word very powerful and i enjoyed it very

698
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:13,200
 much not sure it's lovely so yeah go check that out listeners that's my recommendation have you

699
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:21,040
 read intrusion by kamakloud i can't remember which is the one where um you know that it's about

700
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:26,800
 uh government enforcement of whether you take a pill to correct any genetic errors in your child

701
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,400
 i have not because it sounds a little bit similar and i did like intrusion quite a lot so i think

702
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,760
 maybe i should check out the book i will have a look at that it was nominated for clock award job

703
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,440
 that was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye from me it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from me
