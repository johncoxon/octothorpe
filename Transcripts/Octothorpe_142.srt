1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,520
No, that was correct. And also, we can just edit it.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:22,020
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the very 142nd episode of Octothorpe,

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,840
which is going to a little-known desert planet and finding the child that will bring balance to the Force.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,120
On the 28th of August, 2025, I'm John Coxon.

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,540
Oh, I'm stunt Alison Lori Anderson.

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,440
And I'm Liz Batty.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,740
Yes, hello, Lori.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,720
Hello.

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
Hey.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,220
So Alison can't make it this week because she's in a field, probably.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,880
She's usually in a field.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,980
And so Lori has very kindly consented to be our stunt Alison, and we're excited.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,080
Thank you for having me.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,940
Thank you for coming.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,460
So for those who don't know you, do you want to introduce yourself?

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,680
I'm the co-host of the podcast Hugo Girl.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,620
And being on Octothorpe is a lifelong dream for me.

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,960
Well, lifelong, maybe like three or four years long dream.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,200
You were born and you were like, one day I will be on a podcast called Octothorpe.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,960
I don't know what that means yet because podcasts haven't been invented, but it will happen.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,840
I manifested all of this.

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,460
Brilliant.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,800
And for those who don't know, Hugo Girl has been a Hugo finalist multiple times and won a rocket in Chengdu.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,620
Asterisk.

25
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,720
Thank you.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,060
But it's a very pretty rocket.

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,080
It is.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,780
It is.

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,640
When it arrives and you glue it back together again.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,480
Correct.

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:40,420
You wrote us a letter of comment, which we never read out, about that because we said something about offers of fixing it.

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,860
And you said that's not what happened.

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,500
And now you're here.

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,220
Yeah.

35
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,020
Yeah.

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,300
So we got the box of bolts, which included a panda and a rocket and some pieces.

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,420
And Kevin, we got four because there are four of us.

38
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,380
And one of them was intact.

39
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,320
And then the other four were in pieces.

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,120
The panda had fallen off.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,620
The Stargate was loose.

42
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,060
There were scratches on stuff, which we can't do anything about the scratches, but it's not the end of the world.

43
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,120
The screws had broken off inside them.

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,860
They were very curiously assembled.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
So Kevin managed to fix the three broken ones.

46
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,900
And so we all three or we all four have decent, perfectly fine looking Hugo Awards.

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:29,940
But the update to that was that the then Hugo administrator said that he had, I don't know if he said he'd received them or if they had been shipped replacement parts.

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,640
And basically that he would send, like if your panda was scratched or cracked, he would send you a new panda and send the parts that were broken.

49
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,580
And we said, okay, here's a list of our stuff that's broken.

50
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,680
And then it just never came.

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,740
And I want to say that was December of 2020.

52
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,180
How long has this been?

53
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,040
I don't know.

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,180
It's been so long ago.

55
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,400
Two years.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,380
We never, we just never heard from him again.

57
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,900
And I, you know, I have a trophy.

58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,680
I fixed it.

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,540
Well, Kevin fixed it.

60
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,740
You know, that counts.

61
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,820
And it is what it is.

62
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,240
But I just didn't want people to think that we had an offer of help that we had turned down, an offer to repair.

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,100
And honestly, even if there had been an offer to repair, I don't think it would have happened because some people still haven't ever received theirs.

64
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,540
And that's too bad.

65
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,460
That is fair.

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,860
I've got a Hugo question, which is, did Chengdu send you four Hugos automatically?

67
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,420
Or did you actually pay for one of those?

68
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,300
They actually gave them all to us.

69
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,340
We did not have to pay for anything.

70
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,460
That was very nice.

71
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,080
Because I think typically you get three at the most and have to pay after that.

72
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,700
And at least that's what I understand from previous winners who have talked about having to purchase them.

73
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,660
It varies.

74
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,840
It varies wildly from Worldcon to Worldcon.

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,620
But yeah, listeners may not be aware.

76
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,760
But basically, the Worldcon will pay for your first N Hugos.

77
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,720
And then if you're a very large team, you might have to pay for extras.

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,860
I'm not sure what Glasgow did.

79
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,260
I want to say they didn't charge for extras.

80
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,520
But I might be wrong.

81
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,620
Glasgow, right in.

82
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,440
The whole city.

83
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,700
But yes, thank you for coming, Lori.

84
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,600
We're not going to do letters of comment this week, listeners, because we'll do them.

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,340
We're recording again in a week's time.

86
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,000
So we can do a bumper letter of comment roster then.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,600
And also, you know.

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,180
Alison might have opinions.

89
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,640
And Lori's written a list of bullet points, which is more organized than we often are.

90
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,160
It's absolutely more organized than we ever are.

91
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,040
We usually have bullet points, but.

92
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,760
I kept a little running list of things I didn't want to forget during the con.

93
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,200
During the con.

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,760
Wow.

95
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,980
Wow.

96
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,320
Yeah, I would just occasionally add something.

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,780
That's bananas.

98
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,780
Okay.

99
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,260
So, because I don't understand your first bullet point.

100
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,260
So my first bullet point is found the Glasgow tartan ribbon.

101
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,040
Right.

102
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,900
And here's what happened, friends.

103
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:47,800
So those of you who attended the World Con in Glasgow may remember that I had tartan badge ribbons.

104
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,860
And I had made them myself.

105
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,920
I bought a roll of ribbon and I cut it up and I put double-sided bra tape on them and I made my own ribbons.

106
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,400
And they were very popular.

107
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:05,360
At the end of the con, Alison Scott approached me and said someone had given her a roll of ribbon and she thought that I might like it for making badge ribbons.

108
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,460
And I was like, ooh, yes, I'll make badge ribbons and I'll take them to Seattle.

109
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,000
Maybe people will still be interested in the tartan.

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,240
I distinctly remember getting home and unpacking my stuff.

111
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,040
And since I had taken some little crafty things with me to Glasgow, I had crafty things to unpack.

112
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,820
And so I'm unpacking my crafty things and I was like, where's that ribbon?

113
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,880
Where's that roll of ribbon that Alison gave me?

114
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,080
And I couldn't find it.

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,100
And Kevin couldn't find it.

116
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,640
And we both remembered sweeping the hotel room and not leaving anything.

117
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,800
And for one year, I have been looking for that roll of ribbon and I have felt so bad.

118
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,460
I've had this simmering anxiety where Alison's going to say, oh, Lori, did you make anything with that roll of ribbon I gave you?

119
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,880
And that didn't happen, fortunately.

120
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,680
But I couldn't find it.

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,860
And I was like, well, here we are in Seattle.

122
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,440
I give up.

123
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,360
So it rained a lot in Seattle as it does.

124
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,980
Well, not a whole lot, but it rained a couple times in Seattle as it often does.

125
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,020
And I brought my raincoat.

126
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,740
Aha.

127
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,120
And the second time that it rained, not even the first time that it rained and I wore my raincoat.

128
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,500
The second time that it rained, I wore my raincoat and then I went to put it away.

129
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,940
And it's the kind that balls up into a pocket and zips into itself.

130
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,880
And I was like, oh, something's in the pocket of my raincoat that I've worn twice on this trip.

131
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,140
And it was the ribbon.

132
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,360
It was the ribbon.

133
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,200
Yes.

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,760
I pulled that ribbon out and I was like, Kevin, Kevin, get in here now.

135
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,840
And Kevin's like, what's like he thought I've seen a monster or there's like a murder under the bed or something.

136
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,560
And I was like, I found that ribbon.

137
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,900
He's like, oh, my God.

138
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,400
We just both felt we both felt crazy.

139
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,540
So I found it.

140
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,080
I didn't I didn't craft with it.

141
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,060
You can't get worried about Allison remembering to ask you about things that happened a year ago.

142
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,360
I have learned.

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,920
But I've been worried about it for a year.

144
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,780
That was probably not a funny story to your listeners.

145
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,400
I apologize.

146
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,900
No, I mean, it is good.

147
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,960
I'm glad you found the ribbon.

148
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,360
We have been looking for it for a year.

149
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,120
Like we went through every bag we went through.

150
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,440
I was like, maybe I put it away and forgot, pulled out all my crafty drawers of which there are many.

151
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,000
Kevin and I both have been looking for it for a year.

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,860
That tells you how often you need rain raincoat in Atlanta.

153
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,780
You don't.

154
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,440
That makes a lot of sense.

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,060
So I'm going to show you something.

156
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:17,800
Did you you didn't live make Glasgow ribbons like in in on the floor in Seattle?

157
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,000
You weren't just like snipping bits off and converting them on the fly.

158
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,300
I didn't.

159
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,240
But I thought about it because I had a lot of double sided bra tape.

160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,880
I mean, I made community beards during Shikon.

161
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,900
You did.

162
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,920
I did.

163
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,380
Community beards.

164
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,880
Tell me more about that.

165
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,180
So long ago now.

166
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,060
So this is 2012.

167
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,060
And the community episode that was up for a Hugo was the one where they have multiple timelines.

168
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,140
Oh.

169
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,360
And the little beard means you're in the darkest timeline.

170
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,320
So I made beards so we could be in the darkest timeline.

171
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,880
Community the show.

172
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,060
I heard community beards like I made beards for the community.

173
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,000
And I wasn't sure what that meant.

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,220
You know, Liz does a lot of voluntary work.

175
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,520
And like an important part of that is giving people beards.

176
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,900
Dan Harmon in the beards.

177
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,400
Quite fun.

178
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,780
I mean, I was not at.

179
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,100
Yeah.

180
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,260
I mean, it's worth saying that I was not invited to the Hugo fancy stuff that year.

181
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,480
I was just sitting in the audience.

182
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,200
So I gave them to Christopher Jay Garcia, who did me proud.

183
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,820
Yeah.

184
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,060
Yeah.

185
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,260
Because Chris was nominated in that category for his acceptance speech.

186
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,960
Because every so often the Hugos eat themselves.

187
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,420
But spoiler, maybe not this year.

188
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,140
Yeah.

189
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,860
Foreshadowing.

190
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,480
So nothing about Hugo Awards won a Hugo Award this year.

191
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,360
That's true.

192
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,020
Yeah.

193
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,080
And I don't think that the ceremony will be nominated for anything.

194
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,640
If I may be so bold.

195
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,460
Oh.

196
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,320
So yeah.

197
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,560
So shall we talk about the ceremony?

198
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,400
Sure.

199
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,840
What would you like to know?

200
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,480
What were the hors d'oeuvres like?

201
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
I thought the hors d'oeuvres were good.

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,440
I've seen a few people say that there wasn't enough food.

203
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,100
Now, to be fair, I didn't feel like eating that much because I was nervous.

204
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,060
So I only ate a little bit.

205
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,160
But they looked really good.

206
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,280
And everyone around me seemed to be enjoying them.

207
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,620
There were hot hors d'oeuvres, little onion tarts that I remember thinking looked good.

208
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,860
There was a good cheese and fruit spread that I enjoyed.

209
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,000
I thought it was good.

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,120
But maybe there wasn't enough.

211
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,600
I don't know.

212
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,220
I was picking at it a little bit.

213
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,220
And also in Glasgow, there was like two full dinners per finalist.

214
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,100
Oh, but let me tell you in Glasgow, if you didn't eat meat, sorry.

215
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,360
Because I went up to the buffet like, yes, they had a chicken dinner and something else.

216
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,840
And I was like, could I have some potatoes, please?

217
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,340
And they were like, no, only if you get the chicken.

218
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,680
And I was like, well, I don't eat meat.

219
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,560
Could you just give me like two potatoes?

220
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,380
And they're like, no.

221
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,420
If you take a potato, you must also take this bird carcass.

222
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,060
And so actually then your lovely wife, Espana, took pity on me and shared some of her potatoes

223
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,240
with me so that I didn't starve.

224
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,820
Um.

225
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,180
So there was lots of food, but a strange vibe.

226
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:53,760
Event.

227
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,340
Yeah.

228
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,920
That.

229
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,500
Yeah.

230
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,520
Event stuff can be very literal.

231
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,300
Not the fault of the con.

232
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,280
Yes.

233
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,840
I've had that at science conferences and I've been like, what's happening?

234
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,940
That's not a complaint.

235
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,180
It's merely an observation.

236
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,900
Yeah.

237
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,080
Yeah.

238
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,700
And then you watched the ceremony and there was singing.

239
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,260
I did.

240
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,060
There was.

241
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,140
There was.

242
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,380
So there was a, I guess, a filk version of Down the Witch's Road from Agatha all along.

243
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,320
And I think it was funny.

244
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,480
So the ceremony opened with kind of a full version of it.

245
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,600
It seemed quite long.

246
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,040
It seemed like the whole song to me, although I don't know for sure.

247
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,720
And what I could understand of the lyrics, I thought it was funny.

248
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,880
But I couldn't understand a lot of it.

249
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,800
And the captioning did not caption the song at all.

250
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,460
The captioning during the ceremony definitely left much to be desired.

251
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,420
But what I could understand, it seemed like it was funny and it was cute.

252
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,760
And then it just kept happening.

253
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,520
And it kept happening until people seemed to, I feel like it was maybe akin to some sort of

254
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,040
torture playing the same little bit of music over and over and over again.

255
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,900
Yeah.

256
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,700
It was an interesting choice.

257
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,720
And then they did the full version again at the end.

258
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,360
Okay.

259
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,780
The interesting thing that happened afterward was after the ceremony, some people were

260
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,420
really driven mad by it.

261
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,320
Kevin and I just felt like if you can't beat them, join them.

262
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,760
And they said, sing with us.

263
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,460
And we were like, okay, we're doing this.

264
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,500
And so Kevin and I just went all in on it.

265
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,720
Haley's girlfriend was sitting to my right.

266
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,320
And apparently she wanted to murder me.

267
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,460
But she likes me a lot.

268
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,240
So she didn't.

269
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,120
But I did eventually get a big pinch in the ribs from her.

270
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,240
When Kevin and I were taking the train from downtown Seattle to the airport to go home,

271
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,580
we were on the train and we hear the train bell.

272
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,900
And at each stop it goes, bong, bong.

273
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,440
And we both just were like, it's following us.

274
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,160
The Hugo road is everywhere.

275
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,180
Excellent.

276
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,020
Yes.

277
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,480
But it was a lot.

278
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,700
And it seemed like there was maybe more emphasis on the song than the awards.

279
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,840
John, were you watching the Hugo Awards live?

280
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,540
I presume not because of the time zone.

281
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,080
It was 4am.

282
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,680
So I was asleep.

283
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,440
Did you watch it live, Liz?

284
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,960
I did watch it live.

285
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,620
Oh.

286
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,300
So I have two things on that.

287
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,960
One is that I watched it from a swimming pool, which is a very good way to watch the Hugo Awards.

288
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,660
Oh.

289
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,600
I put my waterproof headphones on.

290
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,180
I put the iPad on the side of the pool.

291
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,780
Very nice.

292
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,300
I mean, I think the other thing to say is that I knew who all the winners were,

293
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,680
which does make it slightly less exciting.

294
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,660
Oh, because you did the beautiful diagrams and everything.

295
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,320
Yeah.

296
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,740
If you have seen and loved those beautiful, colorful diagrams, thank Liz Batty.

297
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,360
Yeah.

298
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
So just to say, I mean, I think we'll get to stats later,

299
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,080
but I have seen all the Hugo stats and had for a few weeks, which is quite weird.

300
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
That is weird.

301
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,620
I don't think I could be trusted.

302
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,020
Well, it was very difficult because, of course,

303
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,580
I was talking to people knowing if they were going to win.

304
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,440
It's weird.

305
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,360
So when I said eight days of Diana Wynne-Jones is going to win,

306
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,900
you were like, nothing.

307
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,500
I was like, I can't say anything.

308
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,840
You definitely can't be like, yup.

309
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,860
That would be a breach of confidentiality.

310
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,500
I said nothing to know him.

311
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,280
That's true.

312
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,360
That is true.

313
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,060
Trust, trusted and extremely blunt scientist.

314
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,540
Can I carry on on Hugo Road?

315
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,520
Because I had another thought.

316
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,200
I think I'm more in favor of it than most people.

317
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,620
But I think the way it could have been done is the first time do like a full on professionally

318
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,540
rehearsed version because I thought the host did fine.

319
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,740
But they'd obviously kind of got some people to join in with them.

320
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,360
And those people were basically, because they didn't know it well enough, kind of staring

321
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,140
down at their copies.

322
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,420
And it did not make for super engaging watching.

323
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,440
But I think if you'd had one really good go at it, and then the host kind of, you know,

324
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,740
reprised it every so often, it would be like, oh, yeah, the little songs come back.

325
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,360
Not, oh, that's that song from the beginning that's come back again.

326
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,420
Yeah, I agree.

327
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,700
So how many times did they play it?

328
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,720
I think it was, well, they sang it.

329
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,340
And I, so they sang the opening number.

330
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:09,320
And then I'm not going to say it was between every single category, but it felt like it was

331
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,640
between every single category.

332
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,560
So it may have been.

333
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,460
When one of the hosts walked onto the stage, they would sing down, down, down the Hugo Road.

334
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,960
So they would just sing the refrain.

335
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,820
And then they did another full version at the end.

336
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,040
Yeah, it's like if they'd walked off while someone was giving a speech or someone else

337
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,420
was presenting, when they walked back on, they did a little like down the Hugo Road thing.

338
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,020
Yeah.

339
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,720
Okay.

340
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,620
I think it could have been done a little bit less.

341
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,660
And it would have been cute.

342
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,160
Because I do think that the rewritten lyrics, what I could make out of them were funny and

343
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,420
cute.

344
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,740
I think it was just too much, too much of a good thing.

345
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,980
I think, yeah, a little can go a long way.

346
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,600
Yeah.

347
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,260
We like a little bit whimsy.

348
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,700
Yeah.

349
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,600
I think it's fair to say that there was a few finalists before the

350
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,040
ceremony that were not entirely convinced by the concept of the Hugo Road song.

351
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,880
Correct.

352
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,320
We were initially told that all of the winners would be called up onto the stage to join in.

353
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,420
And then I don't think anyone was ever untold that.

354
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,420
At least one winner reported that they had planned to make their way to this backstage to

355
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,020
come up on stage and sing the thing.

356
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,020
Then they were like, what am I supposed to be doing?

357
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,660
So it seemed like maybe that idea was nixed, but it wasn't communicated that it was nixed.

358
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,240
And most people were not intending to do it anyway.

359
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,280
A little confusing.

360
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,140
I didn't win, so it didn't affect me.

361
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,960
Thank God.

362
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,600
That is fair.

363
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,920
So yes, so Eight Days of Diana Wynne-Jones by Emily Tesh and Rebecca Framo won Best Fan

364
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,300
Cast.

365
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,220
Congratulations to them.

366
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,600
And then in the other fan categories, we had Sarah Felix won in Best Fan Artist.

367
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,960
Abigail Nussbaum, friend of the podcast, and all around Good Egg won Best Fan Writer.

368
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,840
Congratulations, Abigail.

369
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,320
And Best Fan Zine was Black Nerd Problems, edited by William Evans and Omar Holman.

370
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,820
If you haven't watched the ceremony, then it is worth watching, I think, Sarah Felix's

371
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,820
speech, because she gave a very heartfelt speech about kind of how important community had been

372
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,320
to her this year, and it was very nice.

373
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,520
It was, I agree.

374
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,480
And Rebecca Framo actually gave a really good speech as well.

375
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,500
She did.

376
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,880
Obviously, Abigail.

377
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,440
I did ask, Abigail, how many speeches have you written?

378
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,060
Because she was nominated twice, knowing when I said that, I knew she was going to win.

379
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,880
And she was like, oh, I haven't really written one.

380
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,680
So well done for your off-the-cuff speech.

381
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,660
Well done for you keeping a lid on it, man.

382
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,200
I am really impressed.

383
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,640
I probably shouldn't have asked, because then I was like, but I can't tell you to write a

384
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,120
speech, can I?

385
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,500
No.

386
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,320
Always write a speech, even if you don't think you're going to win.

387
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,260
That's my advice.

388
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,800
Yeah.

389
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,580
I remember, and this is slightly foreshadowing, when I presented a Hugo Award, I was on my

390
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,280
Taftip in 2011, I got to present a Hugo Award.

391
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,680
Great honor.

392
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,040
I can't remember who the director of the ceremony was, but she was like, have you got your speech?

393
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,980
I was like, I haven't got a speech.

394
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,780
She looked, she could be a look.

395
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:03,400
And I was like, I'm not the, and so I basically just said, it's very important that fan writing

396
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,840
happens.

397
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,600
Here are the nominees.

398
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,680
Because no one was there for me.

399
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,960
And then I pronounced one of the finalists' names wrong, and it was the winner.

400
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,440
So I pronounced it wrong twice.

401
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,780
But fortunately, she's a very good friend.

402
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,340
So she just bollocked me later in the bar, and that was all good and sorted very quickly.

403
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,980
And then when I won one, I said I'd aim three times to make it right.

404
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:27,340
And so I speak in the conversation we're about to have as a man who has pronounced the name

405
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,080
of a finalist wrong on stage at the Hugos.

406
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,520
And therefore, I am not, I am not casting aspersions unfairly.

407
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,920
These are my bona fides.

408
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,820
Have either of you ever pronounced someone's names wrong on the Hugos stage?

409
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,440
No, I've never been on a Hugos stage.

410
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,040
That's true, because you did a, I remember your video where it had chairs going.

411
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,680
Mm-hmm.

412
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,080
I love my video.

413
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,400
It was so good.

414
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,300
It took me a whole weekend to make that.

415
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,580
Listen, I was 40 years old trying to make a TikTok for the first time.

416
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,880
Liz, you ever said anyone's name wrong?

417
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,900
I don't think so.

418
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,740
But I've only been on the Hugos stage once, and it is something off a blur.

419
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,480
So that is fair.

420
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,160
You did great.

421
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,440
That is not so fair.

422
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,380
It was cute how you introduced yourselves like you do on the show.

423
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:11,960
I loved it.

424
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,100
I think I only named Alison and John, and I'm pretty sure I got your names right.

425
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,280
Well, you said Smellison and Bon, but I don't know when Barry's doing it.

426
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,360
Liz has always thought that I was a city.

427
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,520
I've never wanted to correct her.

428
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,980
So this is all because the hosts of the ceremony did not correctly pronounce the names of all of the finalists.

429
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,840
Yeah.

430
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,600
Yes.

431
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,860
How did they pronounce the names of the Hugo girl finalists?

432
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,780
Were you correct?

433
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
So K Tempest Bradford said, Amy Saley.

434
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,500
And then she paused and said Sally.

435
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,160
So she course corrected.

436
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,920
You know, given how many hurt feelings there are after the ceremony based on the mispronunciations,

437
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,240
I think it's a little gauche of me to say so.

438
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,800
But also, this was actually a highlight for me.

439
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,940
So I want to mention it.

440
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:08,040
When she said our show name, she said it, to borrow a phrase from Octothorpe, she said it sufficiently sassily.

441
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,540
She said, Hugo girl.

442
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,840
And I was like, yes.

443
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,060
Because most people don't.

444
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,320
And some people actually just call us the Hugo girls, missing the joke entirely.

445
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,940
So when she said that, it was early in the evening.

446
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,820
Not much had happened at that point.

447
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,360
And it made me very happy.

448
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,380
But then, you know, people's actual names.

449
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,320
There were problems with people's actual names.

450
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,000
So I feel a little bad saying that.

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,560
But it was a highlight of my evening.

452
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,860
So I wanted to mention that.

453
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,180
It was funny and cute.

454
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,940
We have a group chat called Hugo Octothorpe Girl.

455
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,660
And Hispania has been trying to pronounce it correctly.

456
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,700
And finds it is annoyed by the words and the letters.

457
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
But I pronounce it Hugo Octothorpe Girl.

458
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,580
Oh.

459
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,980
I think you say it however your heart tells you to say it.

460
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,460
Unless there's a pronunciation guide that has a correct pronunciation written down in it, right?

461
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,240
I have not seen a style guide for our group chat.

462
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,080
Yet.

463
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,160
And nor was there one apparently for the Hugo Awards.

464
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,960
So there was one.

465
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,380
Speaking as like the Hugo liaison, we asked every finalist.

466
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,880
Yeah.

467
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,900
I mean, we submitted our pronunciations.

468
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,520
Yeah.

469
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,360
Because, you know, we thought it's probably important that we let people tell us how to pronounce their names.

470
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,020
And so we let them do that.

471
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:34,080
And then the deputy Hugo administrator spent quite a lot of time converting that into information that could be used in the ceremony.

472
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,380
And that information was not used in the ceremony.

473
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,560
So what do we think happened?

474
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,360
Do we know what happened?

475
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,860
Can you report on what happened?

476
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,120
And if you can't, that's fine.

477
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Oh, I don't know what happened.

478
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,400
You don't know what happened.

479
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,600
Okay.

480
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
I don't know for sure.

481
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,360
But what I do know is that the pronunciations were known in the WUSFUS division.

482
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,300
And it was, there were good faith attempts made to communicate that to the rest of the convention.

483
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,760
And what the rest of the convention did with that information, that is where I cannot, I don't know.

484
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
I don't know at what point that broke down.

485
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,180
It's like Belfast with the Titanic.

486
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,660
It was fine when she left.

487
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:15,500
I don't know whether it was that it was given to the hosts and the hosts didn't use it.

488
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,580
Or whether the ceremony director did not give it to the hosts.

489
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,040
But it was, those are my two guesses.

490
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,560
But I don't know.

491
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,800
They seem to have a stack of loose papers on the lectern.

492
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,040
So there was a lot of paper shuffling going on.

493
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,540
It just seemed like the information was not organized.

494
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,140
And then several times, maybe not several, several might be too many.

495
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:45,420
But there were a couple of times at least that they said they didn't have a pronunciation guide for a particular title or name.

496
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:51,220
So yeah, just, it seemed like there was a lack of coordination or preparation or something.

497
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:57,200
And I will say that I think that Nisi Shaw and Kay Tempest Bradford both have this genuinely charming,

498
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,140
fun energy about them.

499
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,680
And that is not a substitute for preparation.

500
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,420
So they both seemed lovely and happy and fun and nice.

501
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,060
And also, it was a mess.

502
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,640
And a lot of people's names were messed up.

503
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,600
And there was the one author who was not mentioned entirely as a finalist until the entire audience began to shout.

504
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,580
Who was that?

505
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,600
Camilla Cole.

506
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,900
I did not know that.

507
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,320
Which I hope I'm saying correctly.

508
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,380
Oh, yeah.

509
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,340
Is that Astounding Award?

510
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,500
I think it was Astounding Award.

511
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,120
It's Lodestown, I think.

512
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

513
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,520
Thank you.

514
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,500
Lodestown Award.

515
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,940
It was, she was the last one on the list.

516
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,840
And apparently her name was printed on a second sheet, according to what Kay Tempest Bradford said.

517
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,600
She said, oh, there's a, she read the first five.

518
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,200
And she said, and the winner is.

519
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,400
And then the whole audience began yelling and shouting and saying, you left one off.

520
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,760
And she said, oh, no, did I leave one off?

521
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,820
And then she said, oh, there it is.

522
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,120
It's on a second sheet of paper.

523
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,980
And then I understand in the moment you're embarrassed and you're casting about for something to say.

524
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,980
And she said, well, she's on a separate sheet of paper.

525
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,200
She must be the winner.

526
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,540
Oh, and then she wasn't the winner.

527
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,440
Oh, no.

528
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,580
It was a lot.

529
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,920
It was really uncomfortable.

530
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,920
And I mean, I was just sitting there minding my business and I was uncomfortable.

531
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,100
So I can't imagine how that finalist felt.

532
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,880
Probably really bad and awkward and.

533
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,200
Every muscle in my body clenched at thinking about that.

534
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,580
I'm not sure I can bring myself to watch it.

535
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,260
Yeah.

536
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,440
Oh, no.

537
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,640
We could just stop recording if everyone needs to just lie down.

538
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,140
This is in some ways a dead art now, but I'm quite good at print layout.

539
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,440
Some listeners will know that I was deputy division head for publications for LUNCON in 2014.

540
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,160
But I also often do like Eastcon newsletters.

541
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:50,660
Like the very first volunteering job I ever did at a convention was when I did the program for my second convention, which was Year of the Teladu.

542
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,380
So I have opinions about layout.

543
00:23:52,380 --> 00:24:00,320
I think one of the things is that there is they clearly need someone from publications to look at the documents they give to the people doing the Hugo ceremony,

544
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,780
because there's no way you have the sixth of six people on the second sheet.

545
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,340
Sure.

546
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:13,240
You page break that shit so that it's all in some in one block because people are stressed out and you need to make it easy for them to see what it is they're doing.

547
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,960
So like I can see that needed to be better on the paper.

548
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,320
And I can imagine how awful you would feel if you did it.

549
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,400
And I can see why she said that.

550
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,180
But also it sounds excruciating.

551
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
It was.

552
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:34,160
And I think the fact that the last person was on a different sheet of paper really reveals that there was a lack of preparation, but also a system failure.

553
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:40,660
I would guess that there is a system failure with whoever was in charge of compiling this, putting it together.

554
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,500
I don't think we can just pile on the hosts.

555
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,000
I think that the, you know, the convention has plenty of responsibility for this.

556
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,660
And I remain surprised that we have not heard from the convention about it.

557
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:56,100
Especially because yesterday I saw a post on Blue Sky from Seattle Convention that said,

558
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,080
Do you have feedback for us?

559
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,700
Send your feedback to such and such email address.

560
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,580
And I was like, I think.

561
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,140
Ooh, I have feedback for you is what you thought.

562
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,640
It is good to solicit feedback.

563
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:20,800
But at this point, it makes it seem like it may not be taken too seriously because there has been a lot of feedback that has been offered voluntarily in the past week and no response to it.

564
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,400
And I am all for taking a pause to consider one's words before issuing a statement.

565
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,680
You know, I'm a lawyer, so I'm all about let's think before we talk.

566
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:37,500
But I think like a just a preliminary, hey, we realize we screwed this up and hurt people and we are really sorry.

567
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,240
More to come.

568
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,220
Something like that would be a good idea.

569
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,420
But we haven't seen that.

570
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:49,880
And that's too bad because I do, you know, everybody that I dealt with with this convention seemed like a nice person with good intentions.

571
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,740
And I think that they are nice people with good intentions.

572
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,800
And so I am I'm confused.

573
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,860
I've been confused by this whole thing.

574
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:03,560
Yeah, I think like there's no doubt in my mind that the two hosts kind of they had good intentions.

575
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,880
They have been around.

576
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,520
They know that pronouncing names poorly is an issue.

577
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:16,880
And indeed, people have been finding the tweets from 2020 saying they were aware of like when, you know, George R.R. Martin did this.

578
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,260
And I think we all remember kind of the well, I was watching it live.

579
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,040
Remember the kind of uncomfortable or really situation.

580
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,660
So I'm sure they were like doing their best to avoid that.

581
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,380
But there's obviously been some failure and we don't know where.

582
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,140
And I think you're right in saying, look, there could be multiple things.

583
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,520
It could be that you do the run through with the script and it all works fine.

584
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,580
But that's because you're in an empty theater.

585
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:52,240
And then when there's thousands of people there, you get nervous and you get pages and you don't realize it until you get there, which is something that the ceremony organizers should be figuring out and addressing.

586
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,400
I'm absolutely sure that like once you've got one thing wrong, it snowballs.

587
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,680
And you if you get the next thing wrong and notice it, then you start to feel even worse.

588
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,640
And then you start to feel you have to kind of apologize on the spot and it just snowballs from there.

589
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,800
But maybe we need to build in more guest presenters.

590
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,280
So they had a couple of guest presenters.

591
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,200
But maybe if you had a few more, that would at least give the main host kind of time to kind of, OK, I've got five minutes now.

592
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I'm going to chill.

593
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,060
I'm going to regroup.

594
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,960
I'm going to go back and start afresh.

595
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,460
You know, maybe they didn't have enough rehearsal time.

596
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,380
Maybe they didn't get everything on time to do the rehearsals.

597
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,020
Maybe they just didn't rehearse enough.

598
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,940
Maybe they didn't spend enough time going over and over the names.

599
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,800
But it all came from somewhere.

600
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,360
And I think it's a bit lacking that they haven't said anything about it for over a week.

601
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,020
Even if it was just a quick look, it's the end of the con.

602
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,860
We're traveling.

603
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,460
We'll have a fuller statement later.

604
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,660
So what I'm going to say here is that some things have been said on the Internet.

605
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:57,040
So for context, I think we should probably say when George R. R. Martin made a similar mistake at the Hugo Awards in 2020,

606
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,620
Kate Tempest Bradford tweeted,

607
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,100
Did no one watch these videos before they loaded them up?

608
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,520
Why are so many names mispronounced?

609
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,060
And then followed that up with,

610
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:11,040
Can I get 80 authors to sign an open letter telling the Hugo Awards to not allow people who allow presenters to mangled names to run the show anymore?

611
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Now, obviously, that's a bit different because the 2020 ceremony was videoed.

612
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,240
And so really, it should have been possible to do retakes.

613
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:24,600
But also, given that there has not been an apology and it has been over a week, that is interesting.

614
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,820
I think it's also interesting if you have a strong opinion that these names are pronounced correctly.

615
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:40,940
It is interesting that that would not go well when you do it, whether that is because you haven't rehearsed or whether it's because you've rehearsed loads and you just make a lot of mistakes on the night.

616
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:48,500
Either way, if you think it's important and you know you've screwed up, you say sorry afterwards and you don't wait to say sorry.

617
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,040
Kate Tempest Bradford skeeted to say,

618
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,660
Hey everyone, hopping on here very quick to relay the following.

619
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,640
I've not been on socials or the computer all week because I caught COVID right after the con and I've been attempted not to cough so hard my lung escapes.

620
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,240
I wasn't aware about the convos about the Hugos until a couple of days ago.

621
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,520
And she follows up with,

622
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,100
Nissy and I plan to release a public statement apology shortly.

623
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,660
We haven't yet because I'm still not really feeling great or coherent.

624
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,440
And the matter deserves more thought and consideration than I am capable of right this second.

625
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,420
I did want folks to know I'm not ignoring it.

626
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:22,680
And so, yeah, I think they're clearly working on an apology, but it's not in the wake of the last five years of discourse.

627
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,900
I feel one of the things we have learned is how to apologize.

628
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,300
It's not hard.

629
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,900
Well, it shouldn't be hard.

630
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,800
It is hard.

631
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
You have to be very brave to say sorry.

632
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,640
But a good apology is I am really sorry.

633
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,940
I am sorry to the people whose names I mispronounced.

634
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,400
It was unacceptable.

635
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,740
And next time we will do differently.

636
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,540
I just did that off the top of my head.

637
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,080
It doesn't require an essay.

638
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,820
No.

639
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:53,540
And if you are writing an essay, that says to me that you're centering yourself in the apology and not centering the person that you need to apologize to.

640
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:00,140
Because all of the things you want to put in there to explain why it happened, that's you justifying why it happened.

641
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,320
That's not you apologizing.

642
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,200
And it's very tempting.

643
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,260
But when George R. R. Martin wrote like 3,000 word apology after Con Zeeland, it was like, no, George, you just need to say sorry.

644
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,480
I don't need a massive diatribe about like how it all came to be.

645
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,800
I just want to know you know you screwed up.

646
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,760
Am I off base here, do you think?

647
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,920
Or like, what do you reckon?

648
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,580
Well, I do want to know why it happened.

649
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,960
I mean, I would I think you are I agree with you that the sorry should just be sorry.

650
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,780
And I think that that should come first.

651
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,580
And then for me, I kind of do want an explanation.

652
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,920
Like, why was someone's name on the second page?

653
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,940
Why didn't they have pronunciation guides?

654
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,560
I think that that helps us understand what we can do better next time.

655
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,780
I want to know, did somebody not send this stuff?

656
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,960
Did a file get lost?

657
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,800
I mean, just what happened?

658
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:52,100
Because I prefer to think that there were there was a series of accidents or something rather than people just didn't care.

659
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,340
But I don't know, I guess the accidents are not caring.

660
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:54,860
I don't know.

661
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,760
I want to know what happened.

662
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,720
Maybe it's just because I'm nosy.

663
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,320
I think we want to know what happened.

664
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,280
But also, I think 2026 onwards need to know what happened.

665
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,500
And maybe that doesn't need to be super public.

666
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,700
But I think like someone from 2026 needs to come out and say, yes, we have discussed this with the 2025 crew.

667
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,000
And we have done a postmortem.

668
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,360
And we know what happened.

669
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,400
And this is what we will do differently next time.

670
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,100
And that definitely can be later.

671
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,080
I think that's a reasonable middle ground.

672
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,160
So this may all be moot by the time this episode comes out because we may have the, you know, apology and more discussion.

673
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,800
But that's how it stands for us at the moment.

674
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,640
We don't know what happened on the night.

675
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:40,420
But I do hope that someone talked to some of the people whose names were missed off, which is Camilla Cole was missed off entirely.

676
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:46,300
And they didn't list the names for, I think, Correo, Semiprozine or the Reddit Fantasy.

677
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,580
And I don't know what, I mean, that's a discussion we've had before about how many names do you read out.

678
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,920
But again, if they're expecting them to be read out and they weren't, then that would be nice for someone to discuss with them.

679
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,860
Yep, I agree.

680
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,680
I think the important part is for people to know what to expect.

681
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:11,460
Because if you don't know what to expect and you get there and the team before you or several teams before you are all read out and then yours isn't, I mean, it's impossible to not feel singled out by that.

682
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,720
And you look singled out.

683
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,520
So even if no one meant to single you out, the audience is also looking at it saying, oh, well, why didn't they read all of those?

684
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,460
There must be some reason.

685
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,820
And so I think setting, managing people's expectations.

686
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,260
And then I am for creating a policy and just sticking with it.

687
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,480
There are increasingly a lot of large teams.

688
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,420
And so my thought as a member of a four-person team is it would make sense to use the team name and say, we use team names.

689
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,660
Unless you are an individual, you know, you're an editor or you, you know, you're in best novel or something like that.

690
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,340
You're an individual.

691
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,300
I think use the team name.

692
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,960
And I know that some people will not be happy with that, but everyone would be treated the same.

693
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,760
Expectations would be clear.

694
00:32:50,080 --> 00:33:00,300
So, yeah, I just kind of think let's pick something and do that so that we don't have people feeling surprised and hurt on what should be a really special occasion for them.

695
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:00,900
Yeah.

696
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,140
So it is, it's a thing.

697
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,320
So there have been different approaches to this.

698
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,620
Certainly it used to be that only three people could win rockets.

699
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:19,160
So like Plockter, when Allison won for Plockter, they got three rockets and they wouldn't have been able to get more even if like they had wanted to.

700
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:26,040
But I will also note, like looking at the number of people on each team, Carrera has 41 people.

701
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,920
And that is, it's a lot of names to read out in a ceremony.

702
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:38,760
Like I'm not saying all of those people, if they are all on the team, all of them get a rocket, all of them get the certificate and the pin, all of them go to the reception, all of them go to the ceremony.

703
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,360
I'm not arguing any of that.

704
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,540
But what I am saying is that like it is, it's going to take a couple of minutes to read all those names out.

705
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:53,220
And especially if you're dealing with names that you're reading a pronunciation guide for and you're nervous, that might, you know, might not be smooth.

706
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:58,060
And so I could see like a rule where you have like, you know, if you've got more than 20 people, we want to use a team name.

707
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,160
I could see a rule that just says we use team names for everything.

708
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,000
I would quite like it to just be like a decision that we make and stick to.

709
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,500
The problem is like getting Worldcons to agree on a course of action voluntarily is impossible.

710
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:17,140
And it seems like the sort of thing we don't want to mandate, like we don't want to go to the business meeting and try and do a constitutional amendment because that seems very heavy handed.

711
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,960
So I don't know how you actually achieve it.

712
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,920
And you do get the thing where like, you know, if you do have all your names on the slide and they're not read out, you do think, well, why did everyone else get and not us?

713
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,780
And so I remember when it happened at Glasgow that...

714
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,580
I think it was Chicago.

715
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,140
You mean the semi-prosy one?

716
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,100
It was Chicago.

717
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:41,940
Charlie Jane Anders and Annalene Newitz were the Toastmasters and they read out Team Strange Horizons.

718
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:48,380
That was something that had been agreed in advance, but it still made people laugh in the audience because it was...

719
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,660
Firstly, Strange Horizons got their own slide because the masthead was so long.

720
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,740
And secondly, it looked weird that they hadn't read it out when they'd read all the others out.

721
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,200
And now it's Team Strange Horizons on the slide as well.

722
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,240
And so I do think you have to...

723
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,600
You have to just manage these things.

724
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:08,440
I don't have a huge problem with deciding there's a limit as long as you don't do that.

725
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:17,000
But I think there has been at least one Hugo Award administrator who was very keen that big teams' gots were not treated as well as they might have been.

726
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,820
And I think that was part of a power play by that administrator.

727
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,060
And I don't like that sort of thing.

728
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,680
But I do think reading 41 names out on stage is a bit much.

729
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,240
So, like, I am in favour of some sort of balance.

730
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:36,860
All of that having been said, I do think they should have read them out in this case because there was clearly not a policy or any coherent approach at all, which is not good.

731
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,900
And they were asked for pronunciation guides.

732
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,360
And if you ask me how to say my name, then my assumption is you're going to say my name.

733
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,320
Yes, that is the other thing.

734
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:52,100
So Nisi posted on Blue Sky and they said, you know I love Correo and I was on the stage and it was stupid rather malicious if that helps.

735
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,160
But there needs to be something done to make up for the stupidity.

736
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,820
Something besides me saying I am sorry.

737
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
And of course I am sorry.

738
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,860
And then said, for context, I was high as a kite on pain meds.

739
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,820
Never introduce meds as a way of excusing a thing you did wrong.

740
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,340
It never makes anyone feel better.

741
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,820
It's really tricky.

742
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:21,680
And, like, I think there is a thing here which is part of the reason that the firestorm has not been quite as immediate and harsh as the one in response to Con Zealand was that I think a lot of people have a lot of goodwill to these two people in this area.

743
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:30,420
But I think the problem is that if you leave it too long to apologise, that goodwill erodes and then people are like, ah, if that goodwill was justified, they would have apologised by now.

744
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,120
And what we're now seeing is people being like, no, but where's the sorry?

745
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,900
Where's the sorry?

746
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,600
And yeah, I think that's the mistake they've made.

747
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:46,660
I think I just say that one thing is, like, no WorldCom, I think, has got away without having to issue apology for something in many years.

748
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,440
Glasgow.

749
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,580
Glasgow.

750
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,860
I mean, I'm not sure Glasgow did, but, well, they kind of had to apologise for Chengdu, though, in a way.

751
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,660
Well, yeah, but that wasn't their fault.

752
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,860
That wasn't their fault.

753
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:11,240
No, but you could tell, basically, all WorldCons, there is going to be something where you have to issue a correction or an apology, and so you may as well make sure that you have a plan in place for how you're going to do that.

754
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,360
Mm, like a logistical plan.

755
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,540
That's a, yeah, I think that's a good point.

756
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,060
Well, just, you know, it's a crisis management plan.

757
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,200
It's like, okay, what do we do?

758
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,320
What are our guidelines for how responsive we are?

759
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,800
Like, most cons will have guidelines for like, okay, you have a convention email address doing this role.

760
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,520
We aim for emails to be answered in 72 hours, something like that.

761
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:45,160
So you should have a thing which says, okay, these are the people in charge of, I mean, the book stops with the chair, but these are the people who will read over the apology text and make sure it addresses everything.

762
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,040
And these are the people who are responsible for disseminating it.

763
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,420
And this is a timeline we're aiming to work to.

764
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,060
And then things will just happen quickly.

765
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:01,980
And you won't be, you know, I think that working through it, it's like, you know, if you have to do public speaking, you practice what you're going to say.

766
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:07,260
And so actually, unfortunately, practicing these skills is now a useful thing for cons to do.

767
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:13,060
But I think if you do it, then you will not be as bad at it the first time you do it.

768
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,100
Like, it's weird that you have to plan apologizing for things you haven't done yet.

769
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,960
But it's going to be so much smoother if you do.

770
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,900
I think it's notable.

771
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,420
Someone noticed something that LA had done wrong.

772
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,640
And I think LA apologized within 12 hours.

773
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,160
And it had been fixed at the point they apologized.

774
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,540
And, you know, you can't not make mistakes.

775
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,720
But how you react to mistakes, I think, is very illustrative.

776
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,240
Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.

777
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,120
And done it very much more succinctly.

778
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:48,180
Grigori Lukin has written a blog post about the mispronunciations and things.

779
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:54,820
But he notes, and like I say, like, Tempest and Nisi have both now said things.

780
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,680
But at the time he wrote this, he says,

781
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,080
Five days later, there is still no official statement from the organizers.

782
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,100
The announcer who giggled at the African name is silent on social media.

783
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:07,040
Aside from a blue sky post by Elizabeth Bear, there has been no discussion, no article, nothing beyond social media rumors.

784
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,500
This is being relegated to the dustbin of history, an unfortunate faux pas, an oopsie.

785
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,400
And he's absolutely furious, as you can probably tell.

786
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,420
And, yeah, I think that's the problem.

787
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,220
If you don't do the apology quickly, you let it fester.

788
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,400
And then people get properly cross.

789
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,460
Because it's how you react to the fuck up that's as important as the fuck up itself, I think.

790
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:35,740
And also, I have generally quite little patience for people who continue to try and stir the drama after there's been an apology and it's been fixed.

791
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,760
Because what else can they do?

792
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,980
But if you haven't fixed it and you haven't apologized, people are going to keep talking.

793
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,460
You have other bullet points, Lori.

794
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,840
I do.

795
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:59,560
Yeah, I don't want to spend my whole time griping because the vast majority of my Seattle Worldcon experience was super fun.

796
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,020
Seattle is expensive.

797
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,560
But as part of Seattle being expensive, our hotel is very nice.

798
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,780
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt.

799
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,020
It was $1 million.

800
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,840
When we checked in, they said, would you like some complimentary champagne?

801
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,240
And I started to say no.

802
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,200
And then Kevin was like, yes.

803
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,640
And then I was like, oh, yeah, this is $1 million.

804
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,820
I will take these two ounces of Andre or whatever it is.

805
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,960
Give me that.

806
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,400
As I lug 17 bags over to the elevator and balance a champagne glass.

807
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,160
A glass in my hand.

808
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,040
Yes, I will take it.

809
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,180
But, yeah, our hotel was very nice and very comfortable and very convenient.

810
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,940
We could see the convention center out the window.

811
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,640
It was like a one-block walk.

812
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,880
The food we had everywhere was wonderful.

813
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,500
You know, sometimes I think other cities are a lot nicer than Atlanta.

814
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,780
And then I go out to eat in another city.

815
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,460
And I'm like, oh, no, I'm staying in Atlanta.

816
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:53,440
It's so much less expensive here than a lot of other places.

817
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,560
I tabled for the Edmonton 2030 bid.

818
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,900
Should you desire to support the Edmonton bid, you can visit their website and choose a pre-support.

819
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,300
I had fun tabling there.

820
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,880
I don't know anything about Edmonton.

821
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:12,320
But since Kevin is Canadian, we're, you know, we kind of have to support the Canadian bids.

822
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,700
And our friends, Olav Rockne and Amanda Walker-Ruck are heading it up.

823
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,980
And so we did a few hours at the bid table.

824
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,360
And now I know a little bit about Edmonton.

825
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:28,480
And it is funny how when people come up to a table when you're sitting there and they think, oh, you'll know something about Edmonton.

826
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,020
And I'm like, I've never been there, but I can point to things on this map.

827
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,600
Actually, I can just point to the map and you can figure it out.

828
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,460
I can hand you a little postcard to go to the website.

829
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,800
If I had fun doing that, it was a nice way to see people and chat with people.

830
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,360
I was on one panel.

831
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,580
I've never been on a panel at Worldcon before.

832
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:57,900
In fact, I think I've only been on one panel ever, which I did at a very small anime convention here in Atlanta with my friend and Michelle Harris, who writes for Nerds of a Feather.

833
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,500
So I was on a panel about pop culture cookbooks.

834
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,240
And it was really fun.

835
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,220
One of the Our Fantasy members was the moderator.

836
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,480
And she did a great job.

837
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,920
All the other panelists were authors and a couple of them have written cookbooks.

838
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,560
And so I was a little intimidated to be on a panel with them.

839
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,140
And they were lovely and nice.

840
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,960
And I had a great time.

841
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,680
So that was fun.

842
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,340
Yeah.

843
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,920
Cookbook panels are fun.

844
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,720
And I have a good licensed cookbook that I've discussed before, which is my Star Wars one.

845
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,460
So like what sort of cookbooks did you recommend or talk about?

846
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:39,000
So I brought three with me, which was possibly a mistake in terms of luggage because my check bag on the way home was over 50 pounds.

847
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,600
But I got lucky that they didn't charge me the penalty for going over 50 pounds.

848
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,480
It was 47 on the way.

849
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,860
And then I bought more books.

850
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,220
How unpredictable.

851
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:56,280
If you visit Washington State and you have the opportunity to go to Tacoma, which is not super far from Seattle.

852
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,680
They have the Tacoma Book Center, which is an incredible used bookstore.

853
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,380
It's gigantic.

854
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,300
Every time I go, I buy one million books.

855
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,840
And this time I was like, oh, I just want to go browse because I like it so much.

856
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,080
But I don't have room in my suitcase.

857
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,960
I won't buy anything.

858
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,120
That was a lie.

859
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,520
I lied to myself.

860
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,300
I lied to everyone who could hear me say that.

861
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:13,740
It was a lie.

862
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:23,420
The books that I brought with me were my Star Wars cookbook, which I actually got at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, which is the Life Day Star Wars cookbook.

863
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,400
You've done a Hugo girl on it.

864
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:25,940
I remember.

865
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,940
Yes.

866
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:33,140
And then I brought Cooking for Wizards, Warriors, and Dragons, which we've also done an episode on.

867
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,960
And that was given to us.

868
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,360
And we got a review copy from Book Smugglers.

869
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,260
That's like a fantasy themed one.

870
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:46,080
And it's lots of different properties and meals inspired by lots of different series.

871
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,800
And then I have recently purchased a Star Trek cookbook.

872
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,720
It's kind of a survey of Star Trek.

873
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,200
It goes all the way back to the original series.

874
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,280
And I haven't made anything from that yet.

875
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,600
But looking through it, I think it is very promising.

876
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:07,940
And one of my co-panelists, I believe Laura Antonio, I hope I'm saying that correctly, kept thumbing through it during the panel and saying, this looks really good.

877
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,860
This looks really good.

878
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,500
And it's by a reputable cookbook author, Laura said.

879
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,300
So I'm looking forward to making that.

880
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,660
It has a lot of fun looking stuff.

881
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:23,040
And they have put a lot of effort in that book toward making the food look interesting.

882
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,100
So instead of just my favorite example is from Wookiee Cookies, kind of the OG Star Wars cookbook.

883
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,940
Boba Fettuccine Alfredo.

884
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,080
Boil some noodles.

885
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,520
Dump Alfredo sauce on it.

886
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,200
Call it a day.

887
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,040
I have to say, I think Boba Fettuccine Alfredo is one of the funniest things I've ever heard.

888
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,440
But it's not really, it's not super interesting.

889
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:49,640
This new book seems like they've put a lot of effort into making good recipes that also look kind of unusual, but still appetizing.

890
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,980
So I think it's going to be a winner.

891
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,900
So I had tons of fun on that panel.

892
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,880
And I think that the moderator, Christina, did a really good job.

893
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,800
And so it was fun.

894
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,360
I was scared.

895
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,100
And then it was fun.

896
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,800
So I'm glad I did it.

897
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,580
Cool, cool, cool.

898
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,360
I like it.

899
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,340
And you did a table talk as well, right?

900
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,440
And you had Octothorpe ribbons.

901
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,320
Yes.

902
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,580
So we did a table talk last year in Glasgow, and that was wonderful.

903
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,840
So we were excited to do one again in Seattle.

904
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,360
And we had four friends come.

905
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:19,980
It was April, Leslie, Sarah, and friend of Octothorpe, Duncan McGregor.

906
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,480
Hi, Duncan.

907
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,280
Hey.

908
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,560
Duncan was very happy to receive an Octothorpe ribbon in Seattle.

909
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,840
Yep.

910
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,260
We had a nice chat.

911
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:32,100
And we told them a little secret about our September episode.

912
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:37,760
So should you get the opportunity to come to a Hugo Girl table talk in the future, you should

913
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,980
come because maybe we'll tell you a secret.

914
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,680
Are you going to be at Novicon?

915
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,000
No.

916
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,500
When is that?

917
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,580
Where is that?

918
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,100
November.

919
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,100
In November in England.

920
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,420
Oh, no.

921
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:56,020
No, my immigrant spouse and I are not leaving the country anytime soon for worry about not

922
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,360
being allowed back in.

923
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,240
So no.

924
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,140
Yay.

925
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,480
Kevin was on a couple of panels, one of which I think went really well.

926
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:12,780
The other one went well, but had what I don't think is fair to call a heckler, but a person

927
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,900
with a whole lot of comments, not questions in the audience.

928
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,860
But the justice and policing panel was great.

929
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,600
The other panelists were really interesting.

930
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,040
And Kevin really enjoyed it.

931
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,180
He did a lot of homework in advance.

932
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,180
He did a lot of reading.

933
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,720
I'm biased, but I think that he did a really good job bringing people back to works of science

934
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,540
fiction because it could get kind of esoteric talking about justice and policing as a large

935
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:41,900
topic.

936
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,660
And Kevin had read so much in advance in preparation for the panel.

937
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,420
He read The Dispossessed.

938
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,620
He read several other things.

939
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,740
And so all of that was fresh in his mind.

940
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,700
And he had notes and he was taking notes during the panel like a good law student.

941
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,480
I took a picture of him making notes in his little notepad while people were talking.

942
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,480
It was funny to me.

943
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,740
And he had a really good time.

944
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,880
And then he also did home recording for non-techies.

945
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,480
And I think he did a really good job of trying to keep it non-techie because he lives with me.

946
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,440
So he knows how to explain things to non-techie people.

947
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,520
Yeah, so because he knows.

948
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,560
I've heard him talk about audio recording and he definitely knows things I don't know.

949
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,900
He knows about decibels.

950
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,880
I got very little idea about that.

951
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,760
No, it's all just magic to me.

952
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,880
I read a book.

953
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,220
I talk about the book.

954
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,660
Kevin makes the podcast.

955
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,380
Yeah.

956
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,920
It should be called Hugo Kevin.

957
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,560
Well, that's why he gets a Hugo with you.

958
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,600
Exactly.

959
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,480
It would be a bold rebrand.

960
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:51,420
Well, that's a little tip for people who want to know our secret.

961
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,500
So should we talk about the people who actually won Hugo Awards?

962
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,680
Let's do it.

963
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,760
Hey, okay.

964
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,440
Yes.

965
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:13,240
I mean, as of writing, we know who won and we know the voting for the final round.

966
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,960
Basically, well, we know the final round voting for the winner.

967
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,280
We don't know all the runoffs for second, third, fourth, etc.

968
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,360
But I never look at those.

969
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,720
No, that's fair.

970
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,700
So, yeah.

971
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:28,620
So, Liz is very happy because The Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennett has won a Hugo Award.

972
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:35,260
And Liz has been boosting him for ages.

973
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:41,800
In deference to this, Alison has finally read one of his books after he's won a Hugo Award.

974
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,400
I know.

975
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,080
It's like, he won a Hugo.

976
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,860
And I was like, yeah, now I will read it.

977
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,160
Okay.

978
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,960
Thank you, Alison.

979
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,740
Yeah.

980
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,260
Yeah, yeah.

981
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,680
But Alison enjoyed it.

982
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,900
She did.

983
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,020
She said she stayed up all night.

984
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:57,320
I mean, clearly many people enjoyed it because it won by a lot.

985
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,260
Yeah, it was quite good.

986
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,660
I mean, it had nearly 200 more first preferences.

987
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,200
It was not what I thought was going to happen.

988
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,040
If you had asked me to predict, it would not be where I'd go.

989
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,420
And it's interesting, right?

990
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:13,520
Because would you say that science fiction usually does better at the Hugos than fantasy?

991
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,180
In recent years, it seems like it's skewed toward fantasy.

992
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,020
Okay.

993
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:23,080
But I've only been paying attention for like about maybe four years, paying a lot of attention

994
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,120
to current developments.

995
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,980
But it does seem like we had the Broken Earth trilogy.

996
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,840
So that was three wins in a row, right?

997
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,100
Oh, but was that fantasy or was that science fiction?

998
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,000
Genre.

999
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,280
Oh, Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.

1000
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,300
Yes!

1001
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,540
I cannot wait to get that ribbon.

1002
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,520
So, okay.

1003
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,260
So, were the Hugo Awards this year, Star Wars or Lord of the Rings?

1004
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,160
Hmm.

1005
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,220
Well, they had a witchy theme song.

1006
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,900
So that's Lord of the Rings.

1007
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,720
I don't know.

1008
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,900
I never take a position on this typically on the show.

1009
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,700
I'm always like, I don't know.

1010
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,420
Whatever you guys think.

1011
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,260
What do you guys think?

1012
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,340
I think it was Star Trek.

1013
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,400
Ah, the Amy answer.

1014
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,520
Two of the winners were Star Trek.

1015
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,900
I think that's a pretty good clue.

1016
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,700
It's true.

1017
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,580
That's true.

1018
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,220
That's true.

1019
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,340
Yeah, none of the winners were Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.

1020
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,040
Both of which were technically eligible.

1021
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,400
Are you all familiar with skit Billy on the Street where he runs around asking people questions

1022
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,480
and offering them a dollar?

1023
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,460
And there's the one where he runs up to people and says, for a dollar, name a woman.

1024
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,520
It's Billy Eichner.

1025
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,240
And he says, for a dollar, name a woman.

1026
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,340
And he runs up to a woman and she just like blinks and can't answer.

1027
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,000
And he's like, you're a woman.

1028
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,900
And he runs away.

1029
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,040
And I feel like you guys asked me that.

1030
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,440
And I'm like, for a dollar, name one Hugo Award winner.

1031
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,440
And I cannot do it.

1032
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,980
It's all flown my mind.

1033
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,080
So I'm looking up the list.

1034
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,000
If you haven't seen for a dollar, name a woman, you should really look it up.

1035
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,340
Well, I love Billy Eichner.

1036
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,000
So I am going to have to watch this.

1037
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,280
I will put a link in the show notes.

1038
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,520
That is, well, that is definitely something.

1039
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,960
Whenever I'm stumped by a question, I think for a dollar, name a woman.

1040
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,020
Okay, let's see.

1041
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,180
Okay, best series.

1042
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,160
That's fantasy, right?

1043
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,200
Between Earth and Sky.

1044
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,200
Yep, true.

1045
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,740
Tainted Cup, fantasy.

1046
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,580
Dune Part 2, fantasy.

1047
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,420
Ooh.

1048
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,900
He's winding you up.

1049
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,080
Kidding.

1050
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,900
Oh, we can link to your mug in the show notes.

1051
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,220
Oh, you can.

1052
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:09,980
Yes, you can.

1053
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,120
Yeah, it is, I guess, quite fantasy leaning this year.

1054
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,200
So I'm going to pull out a couple.

1055
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:22,260
So I was happy to see Monica will Black Goose win the Astounding Award because she is, I really

1056
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:26,680
liked her book when I read it last year.

1057
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,700
And she won by an absolute mile as well.

1058
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,300
Mm.

1059
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:35,240
Like to the point where we only needed five rounds of voting because by the fifth round,

1060
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,580
she already had more votes than the next two combined.

1061
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,580
So you do a double elimination and that's it.

1062
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,820
Why do I know this?

1063
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,440
Because I had to hand code that into my script that makes the nice drawings.

1064
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,480
But yeah.

1065
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,720
Okay, I'm going to append what I said.

1066
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,820
I want to correct what I said about skewing fantasy words.

1067
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,900
Definitely not.

1068
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,400
Mm.

1069
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,380
Definitely not.

1070
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:59,660
Got calculating stars, a memory called empire, network effect, desolation called peace, some

1071
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,340
desperate glory.

1072
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:00,600
Yep.

1073
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,720
We're still mostly science fiction at the Hugo Awards.

1074
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,420
I'll tell you what it has done though.

1075
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,760
It's skewed very female.

1076
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,560
Yes.

1077
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,960
And Robert Jackson Bennett is the first man to win in 10 years.

1078
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,520
Oh.

1079
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,180
Yes.

1080
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,160
Congratulations to this man.

1081
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,940
Yes.

1082
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,180
Mm-hmm.

1083
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,020
Not for podcast.

1084
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,160
The tyranny is over.

1085
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,460
No.

1086
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,740
John, you should leave that in.

1087
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,840
You should definitely leave that in.

1088
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,640
John's showing his true colors.

1089
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,100
I'm not leaving that in.

1090
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,240
I don't want to get lynched.

1091
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,740
No, it's really interesting, right?

1092
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,100
Ray Naylor and Robert Jackson Bennett winning for novella and novel.

1093
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,620
That is atypical in recent years.

1094
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,620
And then Nevo and Naomi Kritzer won in short story and novelette.

1095
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:47,480
I will confess, I've not read any of the short fiction categories this year.

1096
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:47,800
Me neither.

1097
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,960
Because I finished the Clark reading and then really just read things I wanted to read for

1098
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,220
a bit.

1099
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:55,460
I haven't even read the Star Trek graphic novel, which also won.

1100
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,180
I was pretty surprised by most of the results, I will say.

1101
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,900
And that's partly because in novella, I thought, you know, there were several solid ones, but

1102
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,320
I thought the Practice, the Horizon and the Chain, the Sophia Samatar novella was so far

1103
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,520
ahead that it would win by miles.

1104
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,740
And it did not.

1105
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,280
I thought that one would win too.

1106
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,180
I'd seen a lot of people saying it was great, but it did not come anywhere near winning.

1107
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,080
Interesting.

1108
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,640
I also thought the Ministry of Time would win best novel.

1109
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,720
That was the one that I heard people talking about the most.

1110
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,260
And it was my top choice and also Hayley's, Amy's and Kevin's top choice.

1111
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,700
So I just thought, well, if all four of us agree, then it must be the winner.

1112
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,940
All four of you agree.

1113
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,060
How can you possibly be wrong?

1114
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:34,720
Right.

1115
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,360
This way.

1116
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,380
So it is interesting that John Wiswell did not win because he won the Nebula and the

1117
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,100
Locus.

1118
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:51,880
And a lot of people thought that would mean he was like a lock in for the Hugo, but it did

1119
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,060
not prove to be the case.

1120
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:58,380
And it's given me a higher opinion of Hugo voters because I really didn't like that book.

1121
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,420
You know, I liked all of them.

1122
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,540
None of them knocked my socks off.

1123
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,460
You're very nice.

1124
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,860
That's fair.

1125
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:12,520
I think of the four I have read, it is fair to say that none of them knocked my socks off

1126
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:12,860
either.

1127
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,420
Which one haven't you read?

1128
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,160
I haven't read The Kingfisher or the Wiswell.

1129
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:17,880
Okay.

1130
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,060
I don't think they'll knock your socks off then.

1131
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,660
Fair.

1132
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:25,180
No, I very much got that impression from what has been said about them.

1133
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,240
Like I've heard The Kingfisher is very good, but not as good as other Kingfishers.

1134
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,540
And the Wiswell, I've read the Rosanna Pendlebury review.

1135
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:39,680
And then I read Stone Blind by Natalie Haynes, which sounds like it does something sort of similar,

1136
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,340
but maybe better and with more awareness.

1137
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:46,260
I thought all of them were entertaining.

1138
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,340
I will say that.

1139
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,440
They were all fun to read.

1140
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,440
I very rarely get, I very rarely find that the Hugo for best novel throws things up that

1141
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,860
I just like do not want to finish.

1142
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,920
I would say it semi-regularly does that for me.

1143
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,940
That's fair.

1144
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,200
I mean, you are, um, what's his name?

1145
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,160
I'm just harsh.

1146
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,740
There's been at least one every year since.

1147
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,820
Oh, I think I liked them all in 2021.

1148
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:15,360
But other than that, every year there's at least one where I'm like, was that a really

1149
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,380
great use of my time?

1150
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,240
No.

1151
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,600
Last year, I only finished two of them.

1152
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,320
The rest I was like, hmm.

1153
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,020
I can't remember what was up for it last year.

1154
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,420
Hang on.

1155
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,100
Glasgow.

1156
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,420
Hugo Awards.

1157
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,900
Finalists.

1158
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,040
We did a whole podcast on them, John.

1159
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,500
I'm going to say I read Some Desperate Glory and loved it.

1160
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,920
And I'm just going to leave the rest a mystery.

1161
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,300
Actually, I loved The Saint of Bright Doors.

1162
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,300
I don't want to leave that a mystery.

1163
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,240
I really liked that.

1164
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,520
Those, I think, were probably the two best on the slate.

1165
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,200
Although I did.

1166
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,840
I personally really liked Translation State, but I know that that was more divisive.

1167
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,520
It had a metaphor in it, Lori.

1168
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,560
It did.

1169
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,800
I didn't finish it.

1170
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,680
I feel embarrassed by that because it's not long at all.

1171
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,580
And I didn't finish it.

1172
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,220
Ultimate.

1173
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,820
I used to, like, religiously finish everything I started reading.

1174
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,460
And then I was like, eh, time's limited and books are infinite.

1175
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,360
There's more books than I can read.

1176
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,320
So reading bad books seems like a foolish, foolish choice.

1177
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,420
That is true.

1178
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,160
However, there have been so many times that there's a book that I've read for the podcast

1179
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,540
that I would not have finished if left to my own devices.

1180
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,720
And then I would get to the end and go, oh, I'm so glad I read that.

1181
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,240
And chief among them is The Dispossessed.

1182
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,000
I had tried to read The Dispossessed several years ago.

1183
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,680
And I was like, why is this just, like, boys talking about things?

1184
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,520
I'm so bored.

1185
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,960
And then I had to sit down and actually read it.

1186
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,860
And I was like, oh, this book has changed my life.

1187
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,020
I walk around thinking of everyone as a proprietarian.

1188
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:43,140
I'm always thinking about the utility of colors and dyeing things.

1189
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,760
And I feel like nothing will ever be The Dispossessed.

1190
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,100
And so I'm mad at every book that it isn't The Dispossessed.

1191
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,600
So there's an argument for reading something that doesn't grab your attention.

1192
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,780
I think it's perfectly fine not to finish things.

1193
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,080
But at the same time, there's been more than once that I've read something.

1194
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,360
I've been like, thank God I've made myself finish that because it was wonderful.

1195
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,720
But it didn't grab me at the beginning.

1196
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,900
Star Trek Lower Decks won two Hugh Awards.

1197
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,160
The graphic story Warp Your Own Way, written by Ryan North.

1198
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,700
And art by Chris Finoglio, won in Best Graphic Story.

1199
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:20,920
And the new Next Generation, created and written by Mike McMahon and directed by Megan Lloyd,

1200
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,180
won in Best Dramatic Presentation short form.

1201
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:28,480
And that is the first Star Trek episode to win a Hugo Award since the finale of Next Generation.

1202
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,880
So if you are listening to this and you have not watched Lower Decks,

1203
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,940
it is now confirmed Best Star Trek since Next Generation.

1204
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,640
Which I would say is genuinely true.

1205
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,140
But I would highly recommend people watch Lower Decks if they haven't.

1206
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,040
And it, I think, thoroughly deserves the award.

1207
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,520
I was very happy by those two.

1208
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,020
I'm not comfortable writing off the entire of Deep Space Nine.

1209
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,720
But that was before we...

1210
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,000
I'm not writing it off.

1211
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,660
I'm just saying it's not as good as Lower Decks.

1212
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,960
Anyway.

1213
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,480
Maybe if it wasn't eight seasons, it would be, Liz.

1214
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,340
Eight!

1215
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,800
Yeah, it was back in the 90s, John.

1216
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,980
You did 22 episodes a year and you liked it.

1217
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,560
Mike McMahon's acceptance speech also was very nice.

1218
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,100
And he did some very nice skeets about how much it meant to him to win the Hugo.

1219
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:12,820
Which is really nice because I think right before that one was a speech from

1220
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,180
Randall Shepard presenting Best Dramatic Presentation long form

1221
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,760
about how the studios don't care about the Hugos.

1222
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,940
And it would be nice if they sent an acceptance speech.

1223
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,080
And then we went straight into Star Trek Lower Decks.

1224
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,540
And here's a really nice heartfelt speech.

1225
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,000
So that was good.

1226
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,420
I will also say,

1227
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:31,560
Vialnerve was like the one that we didn't manage to get in contact with.

1228
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:37,500
I think we managed to get in contact with all of the other BDP long form finalists.

1229
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,840
And one of them gave Hugo voters access to like the Screener app,

1230
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,640
which is used for like the Oscar voters.

1231
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,940
So like, I don't know.

1232
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,620
I think there's a very large...

1233
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,380
There's a big range in how much they care about it.

1234
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:54,540
And also, what on earth were we doing giving the Hugo to June part two?

1235
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,500
Come on, Hugo Award.

1236
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,680
Voters, come on.

1237
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,180
I mean, I was super grumpy about that.

1238
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:08,020
I feel super grumpy generally about giving Hugos to big productions that will not pay attention

1239
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,380
to it at all.

1240
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:13,800
But also, I'm like, should voters be thinking about when you're deciding who...

1241
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,880
What's your favorite thing?

1242
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,140
Should you be thinking about whether or not they will appreciate it?

1243
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:17,940
Probably not.

1244
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:18,940
I felt like...

1245
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,580
I mean, I wanted I Saw the TV Glow to win.

1246
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:21,280
Yes.

1247
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,760
And I don't know that their team would have been like, oh my God, we won a Hugo Award.

1248
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:29,280
But like, Ariana Grande probably does not care if Wicked wins a Hugo Award.

1249
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,340
I don't know that though.

1250
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:33,620
Maybe she's a huge science fiction fan and it would be a dream for her.

1251
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:34,180
I don't know.

1252
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,460
Ariana, write in.

1253
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,080
Let us know.

1254
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,080
Yeah, right.

1255
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,800
Do this podcast.

1256
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,840
I don't think she listens.

1257
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,400
No.

1258
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,520
Might be wrong.

1259
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,860
Well, we'll find out if you get a lock from her.

1260
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,700
But in general, I thought it was a good roster.

1261
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,840
Like, there's a couple that I'm not super pleased with.

1262
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,500
But in general, I think it's a pretty good list of winners.

1263
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:58,520
Yeah, I just wanted to pull out, since we have a fancast finalist here as well, that Worldbuilding

1264
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:05,400
for Masochists lost by one vote to Eight Days of Dino and Jones, which is quite harsh because

1265
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,520
they also lost to us last year by seven votes.

1266
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,060
We're sorry, guys.

1267
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:10,960
Yeah.

1268
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,520
Like, if that was me, I would be feeling really like, I'm so close, but so far.

1269
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:22,320
So yeah, maybe, maybe 2026 is their year because I think they have a really good following.

1270
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,380
They definitely do.

1271
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,760
And they're also also nice.

1272
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,400
Yeah.

1273
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,180
They're lovely.

1274
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:29,840
They were at the podcasters meet up in Glasgow and they were all lovely, lovely.

1275
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,480
Mm hmm.

1276
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,040
Marshall from Worldbuilding invited us to Armadillo Con.

1277
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,660
So we will be there in Austin next month at their local con.

1278
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,440
Oh, I see.

1279
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,440
You'll go to Armadillo Con, but you won't come to NovaCon.

1280
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,380
We went all the way to Glasgow, John.

1281
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,840
Yeah.

1282
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,940
John, to be fair, I didn't go to NovaCon that much when I lived in the same country.

1283
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,540
So yeah.

1284
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,960
It's Emily Tesh this year.

1285
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,920
Yeah, I would.

1286
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,260
If I was there, I would be going.

1287
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:55,960
Yeah.

1288
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:00,960
Well, and also we've got a surprise for the live episode at NovaCon.

1289
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:09,900
We should let our guest go first.

1290
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,620
Lori, do you have a pick?

1291
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,980
I forgot about picks.

1292
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,780
So I scrambled and came up with a pick a few minutes ago.

1293
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:22,880
So I'm currently reading, but have not finished, The Traitor Beru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson.

1294
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,640
I believe it is a 2015 fantasy novel.

1295
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:32,760
My coworker, who's very into science fiction, and he's my one work friend who knows what the

1296
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,260
Hugos are.

1297
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:39,200
So in my, actually in my job interview, it came up and I said I had won a Hugo in 2023

1298
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,900
and he threw down his pen and he said, we have to hire her.

1299
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:47,600
So I was lucky that they did, because that would have been awkward if they didn't.

1300
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,660
But anyway, he recommended it and he does not really read fantasy.

1301
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,320
And he said it was so good that he's read several in the series.

1302
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,640
And so I am about halfway through it and I like it a lot.

1303
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,300
It has a lot of accounting.

1304
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,160
So I'm doing some skimming.

1305
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,780
Beru Cormorant is an accountant.

1306
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,660
So I'm doing some skimming, but I do like it.

1307
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,240
I think it's good.

1308
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,160
Cool, cool, cool.

1309
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,260
I've never heard of it.

1310
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,780
Wikipedia says it's hard fantasy and I don't know what that means.

1311
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:13,220
I don't know what that means either.

1312
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,380
And to be honest with you, it doesn't feel super fantastical.

1313
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:23,000
And it's about 600 pages and I'm halfway through and there's one kind of modified human in it.

1314
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,520
But other than that, which honestly could be science fiction.

1315
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,720
Maybe that's why he likes it.

1316
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,900
It doesn't.

1317
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,380
Yeah, there's not.

1318
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,360
I haven't seen any magic or anything like that.

1319
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:37,740
But it has what my co-host Haley and listeners of Hugo Girl will know refers to as an oppressive fantasy feeling.

1320
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,780
It does have that.

1321
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,640
It's got a fantasy vibe.

1322
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,480
Interesting.

1323
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,740
And I mean, what is genre if not vibes?

1324
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,980
That is true.

1325
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,280
I read it.

1326
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,420
I read it when it came out because it was a big thing.

1327
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,520
I remember it being a big thing.

1328
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,580
And yeah, it is pretty brutal.

1329
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,220
I remember.

1330
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,440
So yeah, you've got going to enjoy the end of that.

1331
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,520
Great.

1332
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,600
The next one is called The Tyrant Beru Cormorant.

1333
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,140
So I think our hero may become an anti-hero.

1334
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:10,840
I think actually it's that's the third one.

1335
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,900
So I think it was going to be a trilogy and now it's for something like this.

1336
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,160
So but it's honestly because I read it 10 years ago.

1337
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,940
It's one of those things where once the whole series is complete, I might have to reread the whole thing.

1338
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:27,600
But I also heard good things about Exodia, which was Dickinson's science fiction novel last year.

1339
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,820
Yes, that that's I'm glad you said that.

1340
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:34,060
That's why my co-worker picked up this series because he liked that so much.

1341
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:37,500
He liked it enough that he was willing to give fantasy a try.

1342
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,220
I pray.

1343
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,680
Liz, do you want to do a pick?

1344
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,780
Yes, I will do a pick.

1345
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:44,700
My pick is The Friend Zone Experiment by Zen Cho.

1346
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,320
So probably you have heard of Zen Cho.

1347
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,000
Yes.

1348
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,480
Who wrote, for example, Sorcerer to the Crown and has written a bunch of great fantasy novels.

1349
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:58,240
And The Friend Zone Experiment is their first mainline romance novel.

1350
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:05,400
But I would say it has quite a lot of similarity to the stuff I like in their non-romance novels in that it's very character driven.

1351
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,760
It's about a Singaporean and a Malaysian who live in London.

1352
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:18,700
So it's got this great thing where the setting is London, but it's got kind of people who have come in from a different environment and really interesting stuff about that.

1353
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,760
It's all about family.

1354
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,900
It's about kind of family expectations.

1355
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:29,460
I'd say the one place it does fall down is it's called The Friend Zone Experiment and it's got a very lively cover.

1356
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,540
And that makes you think it's going to be kind of a lot more of a lighter romance than it actually is.

1357
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:42,400
The romance is maybe not at the forefront, which is maybe a little bit strange for a romance novel where they tend to be right at the front.

1358
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,120
And I would say like the romance is maybe not the most exciting thing about this one.

1359
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:52,260
But it is a fun portrayal of two people who they knew each other 10 years ago and they meet again 10 years later.

1360
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:57,880
And as grownups, they figure out like how life is going to work and families.

1361
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,480
And it manages to kind of intertwine them together in a pretty interesting way, I think.

1362
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,820
So, yeah, I enjoyed it.

1363
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,500
But maybe don't go in thinking it's going to be a fun light romance.

1364
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,300
There is some quite serious stuff about families and family expectations and so on.

1365
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,120
Nice.

1366
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,040
Sounds like a hoot.

1367
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,100
I was listening.

1368
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,500
It doesn't sound like a hoot.

1369
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,740
Well, it kind of is a hoot and also not hoot.

1370
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,500
I don't know.

1371
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,840
Oh, interesting.

1372
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:22,660
Hoo-hoo.

1373
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:27,260
I wasn't going to pick a book, but you guys have both picked books.

1374
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,700
So I guess I should pick a book.

1375
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,000
So I'll pick a book.

1376
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,900
It's all right, John.

1377
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,580
You don't have to feel constrained by the way of expectations.

1378
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:38,100
I just I want to I just I don't want to be the one that stands out.

1379
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:45,120
I have read a book called The Sentence by Gautam Batia.

1380
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:52,240
This is a book which I got because a PhD student.

1381
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,480
I work in academia.

1382
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,840
I have multiple colleagues and there are multiple students who are from India.

1383
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,980
And one of the students was going back to see family.

1384
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,040
So I asked her to pick me a copy up and then she brought it back.

1385
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,060
Very thankful to her.

1386
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,100
Thank you, Nikita.

1387
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:10,660
And this I don't think has had a British release yet, but I think there is an international release

1388
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:10,980
coming.

1389
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,780
So hopefully it will eventually be available.

1390
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:21,220
But this is a book set in a city which is divided into two halves.

1391
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:29,220
The high town is kind of the the gentry in the upper classes and low town is the commune,

1392
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:33,140
which is a kind of anarchist collective of workers who are in revolt.

1393
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:43,000
And the story follows a young guardian, Nila, who is investigating a cold case of a murder

1394
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,200
a hundred years old.

1395
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,200
But the the twist is that the murder she's investigating is the murder of the previous

1396
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:55,340
director of the city, which led to this kind of partitioning of the city into two halves.

1397
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:02,460
And also the person who was found to be guilty was given what is called the sentence, which

1398
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:08,180
is where in this world the death penalty has been outlawed because it was inhumane because

1399
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:12,560
you can't reverse it if you find that they're actually innocent.

1400
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,400
But as soon as they invented cryogenics, ho ho, you can reverse that if it turns out they're

1401
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:17,700
innocent.

1402
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,380
We'll just put them in a coffin and not kill them, but they won't be around.

1403
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,340
Loophole ethics.

1404
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:28,120
And so, yeah, it's about her investigating that and about the things she uncovers.

1405
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:28,960
And it's very, very good.

1406
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:35,600
It kind of reminded me of if if a China Mayville book was better edited.

1407
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,400
Fair.

1408
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,760
I've read that as well.

1409
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,760
I enjoyed it.

1410
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,380
And I think that that conceit with the this isn't the death penalty.

1411
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:43,860
We remove you from your life.

1412
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:48,120
And if you're eventually exonerated, probably everyone, you know, might be dead.

1413
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,520
The world is different, but we didn't kill you.

1414
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:54,140
And it asks all kinds of interesting ethical legal questions.

1415
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:56,600
And the author is a constitutional scholar.

1416
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,440
So it makes sense.

1417
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,200
Because because for those who don't know, Lori, you're a lawyer.

1418
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,500
So I had not read you realized you'd read it.

1419
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,960
But it must be very interesting to see that side of it.

1420
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,800
I have no expertise in that at all.

1421
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,320
So, yeah, I think it raises really interesting questions about.

1422
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,080
Well, first of all, that lies we tell ourselves about what's ethical and what's humane.

1423
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,900
Also about what is the purpose of punishment.

1424
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:17,940
Mm hmm.

1425
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,500
I thought it was I thought it was really good.

1426
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:26,080
I like the portrayal of basically a law student trying to find her feet and her ambition versus

1427
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,660
what she thinks is the right thing to do.

1428
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,200
All of that is really interesting.

1429
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,140
And he is super, super smart.

1430
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,160
Also an editor for Strange Horizons.

1431
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:34,860
Yes.

1432
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,840
Editor in chief.

1433
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,100
Yeah.

1434
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:36,360
Yeah.

1435
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:40,000
I would quite like him to write more in this world.

1436
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,500
I'm not sure I need more of these characters, but I'd love to know.

1437
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:48,940
I'd love to have books set in a similar setting that kind of explore more of the world he's

1438
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:51,520
built because because I did find it absolutely fascinating.

1439
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:57,100
Not the same world, but he has also published The Wall and the Horizon, which is a duology.

1440
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:04,580
And it does some similar things with trying to just reexamine the way we look at the world.

1441
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:05,220
Okay.

1442
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:10,260
And it comes from Le Guin, the idea of trying to picture something other than capitalism.

1443
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:16,340
And he's the way that he's framed that is with a walled city where no one's ever seen

1444
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,340
outside of it.

1445
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:20,260
And they're trying to just imagine what could be outside of this city.

1446
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,500
And it's it's I think it's really well done.

1447
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,200
Interesting.

1448
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:23,500
Okay.

1449
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,360
I will look those up.

1450
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,780
Fans of the dispossessed.

1451
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:29,560
Me being a new one will really appreciate what he's doing with that duology.

1452
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,600
Excellent.

1453
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,660
Thank you very much.

1454
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,600
Do you have it?

1455
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,000
Have you read the sentence, Liz?

1456
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,580
I have not.

1457
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,680
I've heard of it, but I know I copy.

1458
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,660
I don't know where I get a copy.

1459
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:41,300
India.

1460
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,580
Pay attention.

1461
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:47,480
The sentence was reviewed by friend of the podcast, Andy Openshaw.

1462
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,860
And Gautam mentioned it in his newsletter.

1463
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:52,660
But I will I will dig the link out to that.

1464
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,380
Nice.

1465
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:54,020
Where's that review?

1466
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,600
I was hoping you were going to ask me that, Liz, because I can't remember where he wrote

1467
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:57,860
it.

1468
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,200
I just remember he did write it.

1469
01:09:59,200 --> 01:09:59,600
All right.

1470
01:09:59,600 --> 01:09:59,820
Fine.

1471
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,240
It will be a link in the show notes, listeners.

1472
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,640
I'll keep all of this in to reveal my ignorance.

1473
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,520
But on that bombshell, that was the Octothorpe podcast.

1474
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,720
And it's goodbye from me.

1475
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,040
It's goodbye from me.

1476
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,380
And it's goodbye from me.

1477
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,000
But one day we do want to come to an Easter con.

1478
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
That'd be so good.

1479
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,500
Yes, that would be fun.

1480
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,280
And you can go in and you know, although if you go in and you're not there, then you could

1481
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,940
be stunt Liz again.

1482
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,340
I could be.

1483
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:48,140
Well, I've never been a stunt Liz before.

1484
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,020
Well, exactly.

1485
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,420
Totally different experience being a stunt Allison, honestly.

1486
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,260
I bet.

1487
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,040
It's true.

1488
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,660
You arrive early and you've got air conditioning and your microphone's not broken.

1489
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:00,880
My microphone is Allison's.

1490
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,400
Oh, you said Allison's is often broken.

1491
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,240
I mean, mine wasn't working today.

1492
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,220
So yeah, I guess I'm really on the ball.
