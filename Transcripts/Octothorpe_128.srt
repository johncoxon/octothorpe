1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 "Prisperter?" You remember the letter of comment that we were discussing before this one?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,000
 You know. You remember the one where I read out the name of the film? Maybe three or four minutes

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,400
 ago. It is possible I was not paying close attention at that exact moment.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:29,760
 Fair enough. We also heard... Sorry. That's all right. I can't really criticize anyone for

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,520
 having a lapse of attention. John like joins conventions and so on like during the pod, so I don't

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,560
 think we can ding anyone for, you know, reading another link.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:58,000
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 128th episode of Octothorpe, a podcast of

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,680
 science fiction and science fiction fandom which is coming to you on the 13th of February 2025.

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,440
 I'm John Coxon. I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty. And we have some letters of comment.

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:22,640
 So first up we heard from Andreas Devauer who sent us both a toot and an email. He says,

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,680
 he remembers how people used to say they needed a window system to play games and then they claimed

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
 that they needed a window system or a Mac. Now Alison says you can play games quite well on a

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
 Mac as long as they're not using graphics but his Steam Decks runs the Linux that he's been

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,800
 sticking with all these years. I'm going to say I don't ever remember the time people said you

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,120
 needed a Mac to run games. I am going to say also that as Macs are Unix under the hood they can

16
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,400
 generally run anything that you can run on. Linux is generally though of course Steam Decks are

17
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,840
 tweaked for games so that's a bit different but in general. Macs will do anything Linux can.

18
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
 Yeah but you've got to recompile everything for the ARM chips now.

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,960
 Yes it's the trade off. It's the trade off so I've got a friend with a Steam Deck and I've got

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,480
 a friend and I've got a Switch and it is noticeable how much better the battery life is on my Mac

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,000
 book than it is on the Switch or the Steam Deck because of ARM. Those Intel processors

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,200
 pour they battery hungry. We need to heat our houses with something don't we?

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:33,760
 My our house is noticeably harder to heat since we went to ARM processors and also LED lights.

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,600
 But yeah I always say as a Mac as a Mac person I've never really played games on Mac like I played

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,960
 them on my PlayStation. I used to play them on Windows but then I don't now. Having noticed last

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,680
 time that I had been playing loads of games on my Mac and this had prevented me from doing any

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,280
 work I have got better and I've done it much less this two weeks I've just played loads of

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
 board games instead I'm not sure that's actually better but it feels more worthy.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,600
 But I mean this all kind of started I seem to remember when Mac gaming started becoming more

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,760
 common that was like alongside Linux gaming because it was the humble bundles that got this all

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,320
 kind of kicked off in the old days and it very much seemed like they were both being done at the

32
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,560
 same time but I don't know if that's true or not. But I see relatively few games on Steam that are

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,360
 Windows and Mac but not Linux. It does seem to be either Windows only or all three in general.

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,800
 He also emailed in to say he wonders are fan funds as relevant as they used to be. These days we're

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,280
 seeing more exchange of ideas across other electronic media and people are traveling more

36
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,720
 freely than they did when fan funds like TAF were first brought up maybe he's totally off his

37
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,640
 rocker or has history moving on made fan funds less of a thing. I've always said ultimately the

38
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,040
 fan funds will die when they're no longer relevant because they rely on people voting for them to

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,720
 work. So if people thought TAF was irrelevant TAF would have gone and they don't so it hasn't.

40
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,280
 So I think the answer is in the fact that it's still there but also international travel I think

41
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,480
 is getting more expensive now or not less. So I think that's the other half of the thing.

42
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,560
 I'm going to say I've been on this item three times now at conventions because it's a favorite

43
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,640
 topic for convention pedals and as well as the points that John has just raised I would also say

44
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:30,480
 my guff drip was completely unlike a holiday I might have taken to Australia and New Zealand

45
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,080
 even if that was holiday was a to a convention because that focus on meeting and hanging out and

46
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,040
 spending time with science fiction fans makes a big difference in lots of different ways.

47
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,040
 There were a couple of times when I had meetups in a city and as a result of those meetups people

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
 who were science fiction fans in the same area but never previously met got to meet and hang out

49
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,520
 because they both came to see the fan fund delegate. So there are lots of ways in which the fan funds

50
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,360
 make a difference that is not just otherwise available. Also people do donate money to us and

51
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,800
 you know people don't like it they don't need to do that which is also fine. It has the non-fan

52
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,400
 fund delegate. I would say I think we looked into this because I looked at all the past TAF races

53
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,520
 certainly there on Dave Langford's website thank you and you can look at the votes and the votes

54
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,040
 go up and down but I would not say the votes have been going down consistently and I think the thing

55
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,360
 to worry about or maybe not worry about but I think the thing to think about is whether TAF is

56
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,680
 becoming a smaller pool of fans donating more generously than it might have been in previous years

57
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,480
 which might be an issue in the future if some of those fans and like you know you're relying more

58
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,280
 on a smaller pool of people and if more of those people pull out then you have an issue and also

59
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,320
 it's going to be interesting to see because we now you know we have three fan funds now in Europe

60
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,960
 sending fans to you know around Europe North America and Australia and does that mean we end up

61
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,560
 raising more money or do we end up raising the same amount of money but slicing it more thinly

62
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,920
 like I think it's not unreasonable to check where we are but they still feel they do still feel

63
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,760
 relevant in that people can choose or not whether they want to give them money by their stuff in

64
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,960
 auctions etc and so in a way people kind of vote with their money. I think that's evidenced in the

65
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,240
 fact that like if cuff and naph are kind of if the if the within country fan funds are beginning to

66
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,360
 struggle that might make sense because it might be getting easier to talk to other people in the

67
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,560
 same country as you and that sort of thing but I think the other thing is that we're seeing that

68
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,040
 there are people in the community who struggle to come to conventions and we have bursaries and

69
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:50,080
 stuff so I think you know there was at least there are at least on occasion people who do run who

70
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,200
 otherwise would not be able to do the thing and it's not always true but certainly if I had not

71
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,040
 one taf I would not have gone to any of the places I went and would not have been able to afford to

72
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:08,720
 do so so I think that's the other thing which is it might be true in general that you know people

73
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,880
 can travel but it might not be true that the person can travel that was Andreas thank you very

74
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,440
 much for writing in Andreas we have definitely talked about the relevance of fan funds on the pod

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,200
 so we could if we had a really fabulous index in the form of our listeners somebody could write

76
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,000
 in and tell us when that was oh Alison could go and search our own transcripts or our own website

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,840
 and figure that out itself I could but you know listeners if you feel that this request for

78
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,000
 outsource work it's reasonable please write to Alison don't don't fox Alison's plans by pointing

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 out that we're making the listeners do work that that is a poor precedent to set list

80
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,640
 so we heard from Chris Garcia and Chris said there is no more fanish form of recording than the real

81
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:06,080
 to real tape the real to real has magnetic audio tape has been recording fanish events since world

82
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,760
 cons in the 1950s and some of those recordings still exist to this day it is remarkably robust

83
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,120
 technique in almost every tape so long as it's not physically damaged can be read decades later

84
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,800
 I have recordings from the 1960s that played perfectly well when I fard them up I own 10 real

85
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,840
 to real recorders one with eight track recording capabilities and should really drag one to a

86
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,520
 con someday so much of the stuff still exists I recently found a trove of reels that were audio

87
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,640
 books from the 70s and 80s they're so much clearer than the cassette tapes I have from the same period

88
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,720
 we should be doing real to real I still think we should not be doing real to real but we should

89
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,960
 be making sure that we solidly archive the digital recordings that we're making do any of you have

90
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:59,360
 anything so about real to real I uh no I do not myself own 10 real to real tape recorders however

91
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,400
 David Bamford has written to us and said reconnecters reconnect program is being coordinated by himself

92
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,160
 and med mcdonald we cannot put recordings on real to real tape I'm afraid but if you bring a mini

93
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,360
 disc player along we'll do our best so I have two comments on that the first is that you do not

94
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,760
 need a mini disc player you need a mini disc recorder a mini disc player will do you no good

95
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,920
 um but fortunately I have several mini disc recorders and now that I know it's a thing I will be

96
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,960
 put bringing them along so that you can give me a feed off the sand desk for the whole

97
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,480
 convention that sounds great I would like to say thanks Chris Garcia because as usual I think I

98
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,160
 may like a joke about real to real tapes and Chris comes in with the archivist knowledge mic drop

99
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,920
 thank you Chris also I will not actually take real

100
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,680
 mini disc recorders to easter con I would do were it not for the fact that we're flying

101
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,680
 so somebody else if you're driving to easter con or or don't mind putting real mini disc

102
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,960
 recorders in your luggage then off you go yarrick i think i only have about six i don't have as many

103
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,000
 mini disc recorders as chris has real to real tape recorders and they're a lot smaller i have

104
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,400
 none of either we heard from karen shafer who is catching up on octa-thorpe so some of these

105
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,720
 comments are about previous episodes in fact episodes where we may forgotten that we talked

106
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,200
 about what karen is commenting on but we're gonna i'm gonna put her head anyway she read the tainty

107
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,160
 cup on my recommendation and loved it yes yes i'm gonna convert you all eventually um yes and we made

108
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,120
 we really have made jokes about the miniapolis in 75 bid which we have messed up isn't highly

109
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,120
 possible so they were bidding for the 1973 world con for decades and then they decided to bid for

110
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:55,280
 2073 but we were never bidding for 75 which is apparently the joke that we made so yes it was

111
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,120
 basically a silly joke where they were bidding for the 1973 world con at the 1973 world con and

112
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,680
 continued to do that for a long time and then people started joking about 2073 and now maybe

113
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,160
 there will be a bid for 2073 but basically it's all a bunch of fannish fun nice karen also sent

114
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,120
 us another email um saying in a past podcast you asserted that it's easier for us fans to attend

115
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,800
 virtual uk conventions which just agrees because the time zone means that programming in the uk starts

116
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,640
 in the morning which is super early in the morning for the us and it's much better the opposite way

117
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,200
 around where us programming starts in the morning and is at a nice civilized afternoon time for the

118
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,280
 uk now i agree and i'm not sure why we asserted it was easier for us fans to attend virtual uk

119
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,560
 conventions but i suspect Alison asserted that i think i might have asserted this easier for me

120
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:52,160
 it's not difficult for me to attend west coast us conventions because i'm not so interested in the

121
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,960
 program but i'm very interested in the parties and they always happen after i go to bed

122
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,880
 now which is very sad karen does acknowledge that yes if you're interested in socializing in the

123
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,680
 evening then this is true us fans can socialize in our daytime with uk fans in the evening as we

124
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,120
 have amply proved time and time again and indeed prove on a daily basis in cafe mousse and elsewhere

125
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,240
 so i do want to say obviously uh catch up also makes this kind of work in the opposite direction

126
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,120
 to an extent where if you have catch up you can watch it regardless of time zone and a lot of

127
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,280
 streamed stuff is on catch up as well so i guess that's another confounding factor but no i do

128
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,360
 think like if you want to be on discord chatting along with other people watching the program

129
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,720
 then that is a very good point for virtual seattle if seattle does streaming and gets its catch up

130
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:52,400
 online fairly quickly it's really nice to in our kind of early daytime get online when america's

131
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,160
 asleep and watch a bunch of catch up on the previous day there's the things that people thought were

132
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,400
 really good and i did that at this con and i'm sure it'll work for this as well and it's

133
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,120
 important listeners who have not been listening since the dawn of time do you want to explain what

134
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,040
 cafe mousse is cafe mousse is a zoom that i do get in touch with me lot the cupboard if you're

135
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,720
 interested and it's just basically people hanging out but i also do one in the afternoon sometimes

136
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,320
 for that americans come to and then americans do all come quite a lot of them come to our evening

137
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 events like the london first thursday virtual meeting and things of that kind raj wrote in

138
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,280
 mastodon he says he was initially very disappointed when he read for the blurb for lady's last con

139
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,200
 because he had assumed it was about her last science fiction convention rather than a confidence

140
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:47,040
 trick which is hilarious me too raj i don't understand why anyone would think that but fair

141
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,200
 enough two people did he says glasco has lots of architectural obscenities the building of the

142
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:00,400
 m8 through the heart of the city but the m8's such a lovely road and he also writes in with some

143
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:07,440
 things he's planning to nominate for the hugos so he uh recommends bond bond and james bond by

144
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:15,920
 eric malinsky which is a short story on the podcast imaginary worlds he also talks about the novelette

145
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,760
 lake of souls from the recent um short fiction collection by an lechie um which is also called

146
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:28,240
 lake of souls and then in novella he recommends last stop by jango wexler so thank you very much

147
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,640
 raj and we also heard from tami coxin about hugo uh nominations and she just notes on

148
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,840
 administrators transferring nominations in in best dramatic presentation they can only do that

149
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,800
 if you have room on your balla in the category that the nomination would need to move too so you

150
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,280
 should try and make sure that you put it where you think it goes and if you're very worried you

151
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,880
 should leave a gap in the other um in the other category so thank you very much for pointing that

152
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,680
 out tami that is useful info we heard from dc who would like to point out that sliding doors was

153
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,440
 probably inspired by 1987 polish film prismideck uh english title blind chance in which a man

154
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,360
 runs for train and three different timelines unfold and dc thinks it's a better film because

155
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,520
 sliding doors and end in a very good way but it does have john hannah i really like the ending of

156
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:27,760
 sliding doors but maybe that is just me also um as far as i can tell uh pris bidetck like i can't

157
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,720
 buy or rent anywhere dc where sliding doors did have the advantage like press a button and watch

158
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:40,320
 it that was a key uh feature of it for me british bradshaw writes to us to say that we live in time

159
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,480
 has we to bix content for those interested which i actually knew and i've been intended to go and

160
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,800
 see this movie in the cinema but i have missed it so i'm gonna have to pick it up on streaming

161
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,800
 um but i do want to see it because i'm not sure it's a very good movie but it's got hantrick car

162
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,680
 fields of florince pureed it oh that's good love for me i got confused with in time which is genre

163
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:12,880
 and isn't very good uh we also heard on facebook from farimenderson who notes that there was at

164
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,120
 least one nominee who submitted a package to the hugo finalist um packet that was two thirds co-written

165
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,080
 with a very well known sf writer um but they don't mention who that was uh and megbert donald says

166
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,920
 bellfast program the aim is that program will open in late february to participants for sign up

167
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,120
 so go sign up on plan z now so you're all set to go do do that if you also want to see some

168
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,040
 terrible puns i recommend going and reading the comments on the facebook post because meg got her

169
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,120
 pun on i want to know who this person is who kept on making him submit everything that was cool it

170
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,920
 was somewhat now i'm really curious i'm very fascinated far if you want to name names do get back to us

171
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,520
 if you want to name name secretly we won't do on the podcast then you can also do this

172
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:13,920
 on the subject of the bellfast easter con um i have volunteered to do the discord

173
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,600
 or i've been asked to do the discord and i have wanted to do the discord uh so i'm doing that i'm

174
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:27,520
 learning java i'm not learning java uh but i sort of imploking java to see what happens um so yes

175
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,280
 so if anyone's interested in volunteering for moderating a discord um do volunteer at bellfast

176
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,440
 website um i think people already have which is good i'm extremely pleased about this because

177
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,120
 i said to the notes saying i will absolutely do the discord if nobody else volunteers so yay

178
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,120
 well done john and i would not have done it as well as john will do it because i would have done

179
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,360
 a discord where i was like oh you want a thread on a program item here's a place you could put that

180
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,680
 thread yeah no me i think that's um hmm interesting yeah i'd have been kind of

181
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,280
 here's here's a discord guys off you go and build it i'm sure the discord will be particularly

182
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,600
 looking for people who are coming to um bellfast virtually and it strikes me that our listeners

183
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,360
 might include quite a lot of people like that because people who are actually in bellfast will

184
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,480
 probably have less time to moderate the discord than people who are not in bellfast so if if you're

185
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,240
 not going to be in bellfast this is a job you could do that will be really helpful to the con and also

186
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:35,280
 a great deal of fun i'm sure yes another bellfast update they've also said that they will be closing

187
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,600
 the application process for bursaries to cover travel accommodation on sunday 16th of february

188
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,080
 12 noon so if you're listening to this now and you if you're listening to this right now

189
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,920
 and you would like to apply for some bursaries to help you make it to bellfast you have

190
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,880
 probably about two and a half days to do so so do get onto the website and take a look

191
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:04,560
 we have also some news from iridescence which is the bid for the 2026 easter con um they

192
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:12,720
 sent a email around there is a zoom forum which is on the day we're recording um it only got announced

193
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,840
 the day before um so sorry we haven't told you about this in advance listeners but if you would

194
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:28,560
 like to know when future things like this are happening you should go to easter con 2026.org

195
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,640
 and you should sign up for their mailing list because that is how i have found out about it

196
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,680
 listeners and we will probably report on whatever happens at that zoom in the next episode

197
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:54,400
 allyson do you want to tell us what is the bsfa we thought it would be good to do a segment on the bsfa

198
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,240
 i am i am a member of the bsfa um and let's talk a little bit about what it is it is the

199
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:11,680
 british science fiction association it has been going since um 1958 and members include

200
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:20,320
 authors academics fans editors other interested people you can join joining gets you a ton of

201
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,120
 publications and the chance to vote in the bsfa awards which you also get if you go to easter

202
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,000
 con but um i think not if you attend easter con virtually i'm not sure about that probably though

203
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,160
 and it also gets you just a sense that you're part of this big uk community of science fiction fans

204
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,240
 which or science fiction related people which i think is good and i having spent quite a lot

205
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,000
 of years not being a member of the bsfa i rejoined a few years ago and i have not

206
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,560
 regretted that decision and we're going to talk about the bsfa a lot and we will put a link so

207
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,440
 that you too can join the british science fiction association if you would like to in the show notes

208
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:03,200
 so one thing uh we heard from the bsfa this week was we got the long lists for the bsfa awards

209
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,440
 so for those of you who are not fully up to date with the bsfa awards the current process is a

210
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,680
 two-stage one where everyone in the bsfa can nominate things and they go on a long list and

211
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,520
 then you can vote for things from the long list to make a short list and then uh at easter con

212
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,680
 and shortly before you vote things on the shortlist and they win and the long list is good i mean

213
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,320
 if nothing else it basically acts as a sort of big long recommendation list of things that bsfa

214
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,320
 members like which is quite nice there's a whole bunch of categories at the moment and i was

215
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,480
 worried when they expanded the number of categories that maybe it was an expansion too far but actually

216
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,520
 there's a lot of stuff in all of the categories so it's not like there is a shortage of things to be

217
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,120
 uh voting on in the shortlist and yeah it's generally a pretty interesting list of stuff and i would say

218
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:55,840
 that because we are on it i should say we are in best short nonfiction yes for episode 122

219
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,080
 which is true because we are best we are short nonfiction um we are short nonfiction but we are not

220
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:10,000
 crucially written short nonfiction which is what the awards actually is for according to the website

221
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,760
 yes i'm very confused by this because i thought they were going to take the word written out of

222
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,040
 this after the last time we were put on the long last time we got all the shortlist in fact i thought

223
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,640
 they put the word written in after we got on the shortlist no they no so i noticed when they read

224
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,480
 the when we were in the bsfa award ceremony in 2022 they read the definition of the category

225
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,520
 out before reading out the nominees and it was at that point i noticed that there a definition

226
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,000
 they had read out definitely didn't mean we were eligible and i was like oh i just assumed we were

227
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,240
 on the basis that we're in it but now i also agree with Alison when they split this category up i

228
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,200
 thought there had been discussion about making it not purely written but Liz is right that it does

229
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,480
 still say written so i am a little bit confused and i'm wondering if i if that was something i

230
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,400
 misremembered or or whether it kind of got changed after i had paid attention to it or or what the

231
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,080
 deal was but i do want to say we have been nominated we have been nominated specifically for episode

232
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,200
 122 which was the episode in which we talked about the world fantasy awards and the kitschies and

233
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,040
 the Ursula K Le Guin Award but also the episode where we reported on the news about

234
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,280
 organotrovwe Donald Epecchi for the first time and Liz didn't get free tickets to Disneyland

235
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,640
 oh no i got very excited about peppers ghosts didn't i yeah you did yeah but yes i don't know why

236
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,000
 that episode is the one that has been nominated but i guess if we were making a Hugo packet

237
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,000
 we would have a good signal as to which one we should put in it but thank you very much

238
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,040
 it's an honor to be on the long list i mean i mean it's although the answer for the long list is

239
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,280
 one person like live so thank you one person um i will also say that there is the whole of the

240
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,800
 podcast eight days of dino in jones is nominated in best nonfiction long form and a blog of book

241
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,840
 reviews is also nominated in the nonfiction short form so obviously these categories are a little

242
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,640
 bit fuzzy uh the category just says we have to be under 30 000 words i'm pretty sure one of our

243
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,720
 episodes is under 30 000 words but i confess i've never put the transcript through a word counter

244
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,000
 that's true yeah because on the long list it just says for short articles and they're equivalent

245
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,960
 they'll all be then because um if you're if you're reading out of speech you're going to be reading

246
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,120
 it out at between a hundred and hundred and twenty words a minute so 30 000 words is kind of nearly

247
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,760
 300 minutes of podcast which is way longer than we manage in an episode ever even let's have most

248
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,320
 extreme yeah i was joking a bit i mean my thesis is like 35 000 words so okay that's a special we

249
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,680
 can record can that would be absolutely because me and Liz both do have PhD theses and as far as i

250
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,360
 know no one's ever except for Ian recording the start of it no Ian did the start of my TAF report

251
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,040
 hi Ian because i subscribed to his patreon so that he would respect me no respect my opinions

252
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,000
 i don't think he ever respected me so you both have thesis's and i have or theses theses

253
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:21,120
 and you have fees it no and i have oh god john and i have a light hearted ten minutes to article

254
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,120
 about almond croissant which i do want to that will be good that will be good it's part of my

255
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,640
 guff report now that i have actually submitted an article to another editor we should record this

256
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,400
 where are the bsfa awards defined because i can't actually find it i looked on the website on the

257
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:46,320
 page that says about towards okay yeah so they took the requirement for the written word out of the

258
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:54,400
 fiction um categories but they did not take it out of the non-fiction categories um maybe that's

259
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,960
 why i'm getting confused don't know anyway unclear if we're eligible but thank you very

260
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,280
 much for putting us on the long list but we appreciate it anyway i'm also going to suggest

261
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,960
 that when you're doing an award it's a great idea to have an eligibility team

262
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,680
 collect checking whether things are eligible before publishing a list of nominations that's just me

263
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,200
 it's tricky isn't it because the long list is i think literally everything that got nominated

264
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,040
 and so it's not clear to me whether the eligibility checking should happen before or after that step

265
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,560
 it's also possible they did do a quick check and i also appreciate that i think the bsfa awards is

266
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,160
 run by a single person who does a pretty good job yeah i mean that's the thing you can't possibly check

267
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,600
 everything on that long list there's hundreds of things i assume someone is in a cursory check

268
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,240
 that like there weren't any spam bots just like you know sticking in the name of beta books they

269
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,720
 got about ai or something i think someone's probably checked the works exist but that's really i think

270
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
 as far as you can go with that number of stuff otherwise you'd spend like three months vetting

271
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,680
 them and then it would be easter and on that subject laser you looking forward to doing the

272
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,720
 Hugo Awards yeah but there's no long list phase in the Hugo Awards is there yeah so it's going to be

273
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,280
 you know prevery category you just do the you know the top ones that look like they might be on

274
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,200
 the ballot and you don't need to do the you know 27 000 short stories that got one vote true i can

275
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,240
 hear different music now by the way over the last few weeks we've been hearing i think rumors is

276
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,520
 probably gossip gossip to the effect that the bsfa have been rejecting incoming reviews

277
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:30,160
 so we were alerted last week to a blog comment from a reviewer who reviews for the bsfa reviews

278
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,640
 steven french and they say all the reviews i wrote for bs reviews reviews the reviews journal of the

279
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,360
 bish sites fixed association have to discarded by the new editor and then says because the bsfa is

280
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,960
 going for charitable status and so reviews of books that the review is not happy with or did not

281
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,920
 understand are not acceptable which is interesting because i think we'd heard the same rumors from a

282
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:55,760
 couple of other sources that the new incoming bsfa reviews editor was not publishing reviews that

283
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,520
 were a bit negative or possibly a book they didn't understand and was trying to go for a much more

284
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:06,080
 positive tone yeah and we we subsequently talked to another reviewer who essentially only learned

285
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,120
 that there were guidelines about reviews being positive after they'd already written some reviews

286
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,520
 and so then those reviews would either not be published or need significant alteration

287
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,280
 we were a little bit concerned by this because they seem to be a bit of a divergence from how

288
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:25,760
 like reviewing should work and also it was strange to me that it was linked to their charitable status

289
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,520
 by one of the commenters because i don't think there's any reason that charitable status should

290
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,160
 preclude negative reviews for instance the science fiction foundation publishes an academic journal

291
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:41,520
 which definitely has not you know non-positive reviews in there so we did a little bit of journalism

292
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,240
 which is i think a new a new thing for us

293
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,280
 Stephen French said that this was linked to bsfa's um application for charitable status which is

294
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,120
 a rumor that had been going around and i wondered whether it was simply that the bsfa thought

295
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,960
 charitable meant being nice and wasn't meaning being a charity and so i don't know it could be that

296
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,920
 but i thought i'd ask so i emailed and i asked is there a change in policy if there is what's

297
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,080
 the new policy and is this linked to any application for charitable status and we heard back from the

298
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,240
 chair of the bsfa Alan Stroud who wrote this is a simple misunderstanding on the part of the reviews

299
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,920
 editor in relation to bsfa's oversight of its publications the editorial policy of bsfa publications

300
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,640
 is usually determined by the editors there is no connection between bsfa review editorial policy

301
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,880
 and the bsfa transition to being a charity the transition has not been confirmed and will need

302
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,800
 to be confirmed or rejected as a motion at the forthcoming e gm on the 23rd of February the bsfa's

303
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,720
 constitution is to approach science fiction and science fiction criticism and there's no priority

304
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,080
 to favor either over the other and we will be working with the reviews editor to produce a clearer

305
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:56,160
 set of guidelines so the answer seems to be that there is no from the top change in policy but

306
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,880
 something has happened at bsfa review and that that is something that the bsfa is currently having

307
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,240
 discussions about shall we say and i think the the really telling thing in the responses the

308
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,240
 part where Alan says there's no priority to favor either part of the bsfa mission over the other

309
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,520
 and therefore i assume that means that criticism will continue to be something the bsfa does well

310
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,760
 which is for the better i think i hope and to be fair criticism is something that bsfa has been

311
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:34,560
 doing well over almost all of its um how long ago was 1958 60 some odd years ages yeah ages

312
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,520
 i wanted to pick out one of the things from Alan's statement i'd like to thank Alan for getting back

313
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,320
 to us in good time with a very clear statement that was great but i want to pick one thing out of it

314
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,200
 which is that Alan has said that there is an e gm on the 23rd of February to discuss converting

315
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,560
 to charitable status if you remember you might be going oh i'm not sure i knew about this and it

316
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:02,720
 will happen before our next recording so our or before our next episode comes out so it is on the

317
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:12,000
 23rd of um February for a bsfa member in the newsletter kind of about halfway down a several

318
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,760
 thousand word newsletter there is a thing for bsfa events which includes that there is an e gm on

319
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,240
 but on zoom on the 23rd of February um it it doesn't have anything about the agenda though so so this

320
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,880
 is the first that i'd heard that this was going to be put to the membership on that date so i am

321
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,840
 raising the signal on it and we'll continue to do so and hopefully we'll get an agenda and full

322
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:42,080
 details well in advance of that meeting the other thing that newsletter said was that a new chair

323
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:50,480
 is to be voted on because Alan is coming to the end of his two terms and the person that Alan is

324
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:58,000
 recommending for the next chair is Stuart Haughson and Stuart gave a very good talk on the intersection

325
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,640
 of ethnicity and games at the previous east con and uh he's a top chap so that seems like a good

326
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,560
 pick to me but i don't know if i don't know exactly how it works i don't know whether anyone will be

327
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,080
 i don't know how competitive bsfa elections tend to be so i don't know whether it's a sure thing or

328
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,440
 not but um but yes that was a bit of news as well um so one of the things that Alan says in the

329
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,520
 newsletter is that he's going to continue support Stuart for as long as necessary in a decision-making

330
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,240
 role as Stuart has long covid i think we'll want to see how that works really because

331
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,800
 you know you want to you want to make sure that in practice it is Stuart sharing the

332
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:47,760
 organization and and not Alan though when we were talking about this in our back chat we did say

333
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,480
 actually a four-year term limit seems very very short for the bsfa um it seems it seems way

334
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,800
 shorter than it would need to be for a chair but there we go

335
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,240
 do we have anything else to talk about or is it picks so we we mentioned last episode the

336
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,840
 eight days of dino in jones podcast which is emily tesh and rebecca frame oh and i noted that

337
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,320
 rebecca frame oh's book was on sale and it looked good so i bought it and i made it and it's pretty

338
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:28,800
 good um so as as noted it is called lady eve's last con it is uh basically lesbian romance from

339
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:35,760
 some uh hostlers who um it's it's essentially a pair of sisters who have been hustling and

340
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,920
 essentially have been one of them has been jilted by a very rich man named estiban menders yuki

341
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:48,000
 and so the other sister goes to try and essentially trap him into marriage as revenge

342
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,640
 which is a pretty fun uh a pretty fun plot she disguises herself like as an extremely young naive

343
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,680
 debutante and then goes off to have swanky parties and go to rich people uh parties and fun and

344
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:09,040
 make sure that no one no one spots her until she has enacted her con but her target has a sister

345
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:16,160
 who is smart and obviously attractive and is she going to figure out what is going on

346
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,920
 before ruth has a chance to enact this con and i'm not going to give too many spoilers away but

347
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,080
 one thing i will say is that i went into it thinking okay this is going to be the sort of thing where

348
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,680
 you know at some point there's going to be a reveal of her hidden identity and actually the reveal

349
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,160
 of the hidden identity ends up happening fairly early on in the book which is very refreshing

350
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,760
 it's like you could have like eked this out forever and instead she goes no actually i'm gonna

351
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,200
 tell soul what's going on here and then this changes like the whole the whole book so it just

352
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,040
 unexpected things it is a romance but there's a very solid um like crimey mystery plot under there

353
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,400
 it's got lots of interesting relationships because you've got like the different sibling

354
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,040
 relationships on different sides um it is all kind of in like you know they're on a

355
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,440
 a satellite and they go off to the like man-made beach in space okay i think i just end up picking

356
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,800
 books that i say it's fun but this is fun and satisfying and the resolution of the mystery

357
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,280
 crime plot gets a little bit complicated for me and i wasn't 100% sure what was going on there

358
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,800
 but i was kind of 100% sold by the emotions of what was going on so that was fine yeah and it has kind

359
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,560
 of a happy ending but it's not like a kind of super sappy happy ending it is very much a yeah

360
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,120
 this is where we have got to and this is a happy ending but it's not like let's see where it goes

361
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,000
 i liked it i think alison is reading it now as well yes so after um this says she would take one for

362
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,680
 the team last week i checked in my library they had a copy on ebooks to download so i immediately

363
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,760
 downloaded and i am reading it and i will expect to finish it this week yeah and i was pleasantly

364
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,280
 surprised but i think probably it might not be a book for me because it's probably a bit too fun

365
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,880
 for me i don't i believe that books should be detergent and serious and not fun at all so i don't

366
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,080
 know that's but i will i mean it's i don't think it would be likely to be a pick but i'm very glad

367
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,280
 ceaseless picking it i think it's very interesting book one to watch so my pick this week which is

368
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:23,280
 not genre at all um is the brutalist which is one of the Oscar nominations and is a three and a half

369
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:32,960
 hour film uh about an architect who is who escapes from well is liberated from a concentration

370
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,360
 camp at the end of world war two and travels to america and there gets starts off kind of

371
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,200
 trying to just get his feet on the ground but very rapidly gets an architectural commission for

372
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:54,480
 um an enormous project and this spins out slowly and very beautifully and not necessarily in

373
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,920
 ways you're going to expect for yeah three hours and thirty five minutes running time but that

374
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:07,040
 includes a 15 minute intermission which was extremely welcome in our in acid of a head as a chance

375
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,920
 to stretch our legs and and get another beer and so on one of my friends said this is four hours

376
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,720
 of my life i'm not getting back and another one said within about two minutes well i found it

377
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,200
 absolutely compelling throughout i really liked it i thought it was excellent i am not

378
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,800
 convinced it needed to be three hours or thirty minutes five minutes long i think it could easily

379
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:34,000
 have been you know two and three quarter hours without an intermission um and and i i have notes

380
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,160
 on where i would recommend um brady kobe takes the takes the cuts for that um adrian brody is the

381
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:49,040
 star as the architect of the title and um he is absolutely amazing throughout but obviously

382
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,000
 lots of good performances everywhere it's not really about brutalism if you think it's called

383
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,320
 the brothe list and there is a sort of implication that this is a bow house trained architect um

384
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,360
 from hongary um there's a kind of implication that it's about brutalism but it kind of isn't

385
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:11,120
 really so if you're if you're kind of really into 20th century architecture this might not be

386
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:16,720
 the movie for you architects hate it um though they probably don't hate it as much as they hated

387
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,960
 begalopolis so you know i think that would be an interesting panel discussion to listen to

388
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,840
 because it has all the same cliches about architecture being a field where torture

389
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:35,040
 geniuses work alone and and cannot stand any sort of a dilution of their vision and and

390
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,120
 everyone who actually works in architecture will be like well it's all about what you can do with

391
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,640
 the resources and space you have available it's it's the most compromising field of all

392
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,640
 so so architects don't like this movie i did like this movie a lot listeners all you have to do is

393
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,000
 find a single friend of yours who is an architect who likes this movie and you too can write a letter

394
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,200
 of comment uh yeah that's true if you're an architect and you love this movie write in if you

395
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,680
 love 20th century architecture write in that means new nick givers i will say that as a physicist i

396
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,680
 regularly enjoy movies where the physics is not always up to snuff um but yes no i take the point

397
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,760
 now i i i am sort of vaguely intrigued by this but not intrigued enough to spend the three and

398
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:29,120
 a half hours it would take to satisfy my intrigue think you take it i might well do i generally think

399
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,960
 films should not be allowed to be over two hours maybe not allowed is too strong but so so this is

400
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,920
 one of those movies where the critic response is very much more positive than the fewer response

401
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:49,440
 i am gonna pick and um it's an ongoing pick but i am gonna pick severance season two oh

402
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,600
 because i was a bit worried that severance season two would not be quite as good as severance season

403
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:03,120
 one and that worry it turns out was unfounded because it is still great uh very much enjoying it

404
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,320
 if you have seen severance season one uh you know you need to watch season two now if you have not

405
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,320
 seen severance season one go go and watch severance season one now it's really good i mean i think

406
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:21,280
 you can still get a seven-day trial for apple tv plus but you know it's worth a month of apple tv

407
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,120
 plus to watch severance and you can watch some other things while you're at it it is great we're

408
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,640
 going to bleep on about this every single week so you know oh my god this we're recording on sunday

409
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:38,400
 friday's episode by word anyway it's just really good and like yeah it's just really good

410
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,800
 did we not in fact pick season one at some point probably but this is season two it's completely

411
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,720
 different so so severance was three they've had three years to think about the direction they

412
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,400
 want to take this which is interesting because i think if they'd made season two immediately after

413
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,240
 season one wrapped i think it would have been much less daring than season two has actually been

414
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,560
 i don't know how i don't know whether they yeah i don't know what the production timeline was but

415
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:16,320
 but yeah certainly they do seem to be doing interesting things still and like yeah just really

416
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,640
 really thought it was i think it is very good so far i'm fascinated by what is going on yeah

417
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,080
 Alison picked season one in episode 59 she did i'm not saying we can't pick it again i'm saying

418
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,920
 that we did pick it previously well no we picked season one season two that's a whole different thing

419
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,200
 it's like i could pick guardians of the galaxy two even if someone already picked

420
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,640
 colonies a galaxy one but does that mean i'm allowed to pick severance episodes after episode four

421
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,760
 season two as a separate pick or have you preemptively picked the whole of season two we need some sort

422
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,320
 of eligibility team don't we what at the end is rubbish john i mean i'm confident it won't be but

423
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,960
 we will cross that bridge when we come to it fair fun factlessness i did not pick seats

424
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,960
 severance season two this week because i thought that we've only had four episodes and it could

425
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,880
 all go to tosh before the end of the season so john has trumped me and i thought i would wait till

426
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,080
 the season is finished but that's fine john has picked it i mean the thing is i can't pick any of

427
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:23,280
 the books i've read because they're all dreadful no i mean they're great but i don't know if i

428
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,200
 should pick them no it's fine this is this is a reasonable pick uh i just think it's funny to

429
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,840
 complain about it yeah no that's right it's fine it's fine i'm quite glad you picked it because

430
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:39,680
 as i thought about it and that was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye for me it's goodbye for me and goodbye

431
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,920
 from me

432
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:59,760
 [Music]

433
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:08,080
 all right so this is completely off topic but there is very faint flute music in my headphones

434
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:14,240
 which i'm not as far as i know playing i don't think i hear any flute music no but i wonder if like

435
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,080
 my headphones the big cable is somehow acting as an antenna and i'm picking up some kind of

436
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:26,800
 weird broadcast signal i mean maybe it's only one ear it's only in one ear sure it's not just a

437
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,480
 weird form of tinnitus i mean it's only when i'm wearing my headphones so probably not

438
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:40,240
 anyway continue and i will give you updates as warranted the theme music for this episode was
