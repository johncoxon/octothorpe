1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:12,140
That's a good point to say. You all have access to chat. We are encouraging you to write things in chat in real time. The funnier, the better. You get points if you manage to make the panellists laugh.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,660
Can I pin three people at once or can I only pin one person at once?

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,100
No, I try that.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,780
Boo.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,900
Just turn it on so it focuses on you when you're speaking and I think that will have to work.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,480
Yes.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,660
Andrew Hogg says, can I pin three people at once? Title of your sex tape.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:37,000
Excellent. That's going to be the title of the podcast then. That's sorted. It's good to get that out of the way early.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:53,320
Hello everyone. Welcome to episode three of the Octothorpe podcast. I'm John Coxon.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,560
I'm Alison Scott.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
And I'm Liz Betty.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,620
And we are here recording on Zoom on Good Friday because we are not at Eastercon.

13
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,420
Although my Zoom background is the bar at the Hilton Metropole.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,560
So I am there in spirit.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200
But I only have water at the moment. I will get beer later.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,520
Did we get any feedback on episode two? It's not been that long, has it?

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,760
No. It turns out that if you only give people about two days, no one really gives you feedback.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,540
We got some feedback from a listener.

19
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,300
Oh, who was it? Listener Alison.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,220
Do you want to read out the feedback from listener Alison? Alison?

21
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,380
I think you should read out the feedback. I did send it to you, didn't I?

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,600
You did send it to me. You sent me a letter.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,100
I'm not sure how Gordian, Oroborosian. Oroborosian? I can never pronounce that word.

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:53,020
Alison from London writes that the person who does our new shiny theme music also has every different sort of graph paper imaginable.

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:02:01,260
Boxes, triangles, hexagons, asymmetric, logarithmic, knitting charts, polar, genko yushi, music staves, and many, many more.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,760
It's highly configurable, and you can make it look exactly as you like.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,540
And you can find it at incompetech.com slash graph paper.

28
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:17,160
We also got a comment from listener Liz that said that when she was listening to the podcast before we released it,

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,640
I asked a question of her in the podcast as she responded to it in real life in her flat, which was most excellent.

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,260
We got a comment from listener Andrew who said that as he was walking up the stairs and fell over,

31
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,500
I said careful at the very moment he had just fallen over.

32
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,800
He accused me of being a witch.

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,920
And we had feedback from Catherine Crockett who asked us to do transcripts.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,920
And we are looking into doing transcripts at this point.

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,500
I think I'm prepared to say we are going to do transcripts.

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,540
I think Liz has followed it here.

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,540
Yes, I felt guilty because John does all the recording and editing,

38
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,920
and Alison does all the making nice logos and social media images.

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,620
And I so far do nothing at all, including listen to the episode in a timely fashion so John can release it.

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,500
So I've volunteered to assist with transcripts.

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,560
I think I was lost with the episode this time.

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,100
I think you're putting your contributions in terms of your excellent opinions, which you vocalise,

43
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,040
which I think is the primary thing that you bring.

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,400
Both, but we all bring.

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,800
Everything else is gravy on a cake, to continue the excellent metaphors.

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,280
How are you two dealing with the fact that you've got three days of nothingness stretching

47
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,100
ahead of you?

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,320
I don't have three days of nothingness.

49
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,200
I seem to have vast numbers of parties.

50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,700
I've had all of the fun of setting up the technical bits and pieces for this podcast

51
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,720
and planning for a Zoom party tomorrow night.

52
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,040
And oh no, but I do have a plan for this weekend,

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,400
which is that I am going to take my four days of uninterrupted peace and quiet

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,260
and I'm going to get legend on Hearthstone, maybe.

55
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,020
Excellent.

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,920
For the first time ever, I've been playing this game for six years.

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,240
Hashtag not all that good.

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,160
I think it's good to have realistic goals for your weekend because I could say,

59
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,780
you know, I'm going to clean my whole house and I'm going to make hot cross buns and I'm

60
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,800
going to clean my laundry backlog.

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,780
But really, I'm not.

62
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,940
I'm going to play PlayStation.

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,000
It's also not a bank holiday weekend for me.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,400
So I just have two days stretching before me where there would have been an Easter con.

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,120
Fair enough.

66
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,780
It hadn't occurred to me to try and clean the house.

67
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,920
I've mostly been filling my Easter weekend up with fun things to do.

68
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,060
And so I have assembled quite a lot of fun things.

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,600
Any flat pack furniture?

70
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,120
No, no flat pack furniture.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm not sure whether Ikea is open.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,980
I haven't looked.

73
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,060
Have you guys got any virtual things happening that are instead of Easter con?

74
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,220
I don't have any virtual things instead of Easter con,

75
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,340
but I have virtual things that are part of Easter con.

76
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,020
The Easter con itself is running, as far as I know, only one actual program item.

77
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,780
This is important.

78
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,560
I'm sure you guys are all going to be interested,

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,980
which is that they're running a virtual business meeting at 2.45pm,

80
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:55,000
British summertime, on Sunday to choose the 2021 and 2022 Easter cons.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,540
And they have had bids for both of those.

82
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,800
So tune in then.

83
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,480
I guess the details are going to be in email and on their Facebook page and so on.

84
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,680
I am holding a party.

85
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,400
If you know me and you don't already have an invite to this party,

86
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,260
please get in touch and I'll sort that out.

87
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,880
If you don't know me, then it was like the sort of

88
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,040
party you have at Easter con.

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,900
So you just need to talk to somebody who's at the Easter con and knows me and they'll

90
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,760
give you the Zoom code.

91
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,200
If we have over 100 people, we're going to have to have some kind of corridor thing going

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,260
on or a tip jar to get the Zoom large parties extension or something like that.

93
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,120
And so that's tomorrow night late.

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,020
I think there are other parties happening.

95
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,900
Several people have done virtual book launches,

96
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,900
but I don't actually have any diary entries apart from those three.

97
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,040
This and then two.

98
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,120
I've got your room party and I've got the Easter con bid session.

99
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,720
John Robertson did a show called Darkroom at the last Birmingham Easter con.

100
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,420
And this weekend, he is doing a 48 hour long Darkroom session,

101
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,740
which is on his Twitch and on his Discord server.

102
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,460
And so that starts at 7pm today.

103
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,100
So I will be dipping in and out of that.

104
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,240
I'm not sure I'm going to do the whole 48 hours because obviously I'm going to come

105
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,720
to your party, Alison, but I'm not going to get any sleep apparently.

106
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,340
So that's going to be fun.

107
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,940
The reports of his show last time were phenomenal.

108
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,300
I didn't get to it and people said it was amazing.

109
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,160
So I need to go find more about that and make it happen.

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,140
Can we put a link in chat, please?

111
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,960
There will be a link in the show notes.

112
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,360
I can indeed also put a link in the chat.

113
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,560
Yes, unless you're very fast with the editing,

114
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,780
I think the 48 hour live stream might be over before then.

115
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,460
I could be very fast with the editing.

116
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,600
Yeah, that's what John's going to do this weekend.

117
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,740
So yeah, so I'm doing that.

118
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,700
And also a podcast by Patreon is doing a panel tomorrow night,

119
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,200
which is actually not, strictly speaking, SFNOR,

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,080
but it is tabletop game related.

121
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,760
It is not deliberately Easter con related,

122
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,120
but it is in the same period as Easter con.

123
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,780
So I'm treating it as part of my Easter con.

124
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,320
So that'll be good, I hope.

125
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,740
It looks like we're going to cover kind of the business of the Easter con,

126
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,340
of actually picking some more Easter cons.

127
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,660
And we're going to cover the social side by everyone having Zoom parties.

128
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,080
But are there any actual sort of panel discussions

129
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,280
that anyone has spontaneously brought into being over the weekend?

130
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,580
Much apart from this one.

131
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,380
There's us.

132
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,480
Yes, us.

133
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,660
Other than us.

134
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,620
I mean, I assume the reason there are people listening

135
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,260
is that we are the only available panel type discussion over the weekend.

136
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,620
And so they really have no choice.

137
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,420
I was just wondering if anything else was going on.

138
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm going to suggest that this is something that people can do for themselves.

139
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,400
Find three people who are interested in the same thing as you

140
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,300
and announce that you're going to run a panel

141
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,460
and stick it on the Facebook group and people will come and listen to it.

142
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,100
Yes.

143
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,360
I think that's a complete plan.

144
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
I think start here.

145
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,700
Get people involved.

146
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,340
Tell them once they've listened to one,

147
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,960
they should start another one.

148
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,420
If our viral spread is high enough.

149
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,840
I understand so much more about that than I did four weeks ago.

150
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,080
If our viral spread is high enough,

151
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,780
then we will just have everyone in the world will be involved in an Easter pub panel by 6pm Monday.

152
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,960
And I think me and you, Liz, are doing the game room on Saturday afternoon.

153
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,520
So that will be fun, but doesn't scale very well.

154
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,360
But obviously, if you miss the game room, there is tabletop simulator.

155
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,660
And I don't know, we were thinking about doing a panel,

156
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,360
but I couldn't think of a good panel topic.

157
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,380
So I ended up not pursuing that as far as I should have done, perhaps.

158
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,800
But I was thinking about trying to do something like that.

159
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,460
And I hope other people will, but I haven't seen anything yet.

160
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,040
If people know of anything, please post it in the chat.

161
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,820
It's interesting that the bits of the Eastercon that we have jumped to recreate

162
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,880
are kind of all the frivolous bits around the panels,

163
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,580
but not the actual science fictional discussion so much.

164
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,180
Yes, that is a fair point.

165
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,820
I don't think if you had asked anyone in Eastercon fandom

166
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,380
whether they thought the, like, one third of the people

167
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,060
who were responsible for doing the only panel substitution was me,

168
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,700
they would have guessed that that was correct.

169
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,020
But here we are.

170
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,680
It truly is an odd time.

171
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,960
Or me.

172
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,700
You're clearly very SF and serious, Alison.

173
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,080
We all know this, secretly.

174
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm famed for it.

175
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,320
Famed for my dedication to the art of talking about science fiction.

176
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,700
Right, so the other thing that they did is that I was going to be

177
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,620
guest of honour this weekend, which would have been amazing.

178
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,200
And two things happened.

179
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,560
That Caroline put together a thank you card for the committee,

180
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,000
which went to them in the end with art by Sue Mason and 130 signatures,

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,400
quite a lot of whom were actually from couples and families.

182
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,320
So I thought that was pretty phenomenal.

183
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,120
Now, of course, there's a long thread going,

184
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,340
I never saw the card,

185
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,720
which, of course, we'd had to virtually circulate in surreptitious ways,

186
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,860
which is one of these things that is harder than you would think.

187
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,400
And then the other thing was that apparently they've been putting together a Facebook group

188
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,100
for the last week all about me, which I thought was very sweet of them.

189
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,640
So I was quite miserable.

190
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,100
I think we're going to talk about misery.

191
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,560
I was quite miserable last night in particular.

192
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,760
There was a point about 11 o'clock when I was kind of getting ready for bed and thinking,

193
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,080
I shouldn't be in bed.

194
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,520
I should be in a bar.

195
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,940
What I should be doing now is I should just be settling in for maybe three or four hours

196
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,840
more of going.

197
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,560
I should really get to bed, but it's the first night of the Easter card,

198
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,680
and I'm not ready to go to bed just yet because I'm just seeing all these people.

199
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,100
And at that point, it really all hit me, and it was just terrible.

200
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,520
So I went to bed anyway.

201
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,940
And then when I got up in the morning, there was this lovely,

202
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,820
this group full of people being nice about me, which is lovely because that's not my

203
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,520
normal experience of fandom.

204
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,440
Normally, I think, especially if you do con running, people are very appreciative,

205
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,220
but people are also very quick to tell you about everything that you do wrong.

206
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,320
So maybe we should do a little more of that.

207
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,200
Patrick has said, that took a lot of conspiring against you, Alison.

208
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,440
Don't feel paranoid.

209
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,560
Yeah, it was very sweet.

210
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,940
I thank you all so much.

211
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,680
I really agree.

212
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,800
And I recommend being a fan guest of honour at an Easter con, even if it doesn't happen.

213
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,580
It's awesome, apparently.

214
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,500
I came so close to spilling the beans about that last week on the podcast.

215
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,120
Really?

216
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,160
You mentioned something else which didn't end up in the final edit, and I must admit,

217
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,520
I thought, she doesn't know about the Facebook group yet, but that would have been a very

218
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,340
germane thing to discuss at this point.

219
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,640
But yes, I didn't want to spoil the surprise.

220
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,600
So you nearly spilt the beans.

221
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,100
I'm very slow on the update.

222
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,860
So I would not have noticed.

223
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,680
You could have probably mentioned it quite thoroughly without me even noticing it.

224
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,780
You could have said, of course, there's this Facebook group, and I could have gone, what

225
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,360
Facebook group?

226
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,380
And you'd have corrected, and I'd have gone, oh, well, I'm sure I'll see it.

227
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,820
I was blindsided.

228
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,600
I had no clue.

229
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,240
You are all muted, and I've stopped all your video so that we can do the podcast bit, and

230
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,700
then we'll have a bar bit at the end of it.

231
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,920
And then we'll be drinking.

232
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,500
And hopefully my local pub will have delivered my beer by then.

233
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,340
But I don't know.

234
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,660
That would be amazing.

235
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,300
It would.

236
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,500
It would be like a delivery from the green room.

237
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,840
Right there into the lobby of the Metropole.

238
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,260
Yes, indeed.

239
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,180
I'm looking forward to it.

240
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,020
It's going to be a porter.

241
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,840
I'm very excited.

242
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,120
That's what, you know, one of the very big things about doing panels is usually that you

243
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,520
get beer.

244
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,060
I am bereft of beer at the moment, so this is very sad.

245
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,260
It's okay.

246
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm paying for every beer I drink this weekend out of the fivers I'm not spending on pints

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,960
of beer in the Hilton Metropole, Birmingham.

248
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,280
That is fair.

249
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,840
So being the fan guest of honour doesn't come with an unlimited beer budget?

250
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,740
To be fair, they were going to give me a very good per diem.

251
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,840
It would have been fine were it not for the fact that I was going to use it to pay the hotel

252
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,580
bill of my children.

253
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,200
So how are you two coping with the whole, there's not an Easter con?

254
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,220
I am quite busy this weekend.

255
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,120
I think I am, I'm going to miss it.

256
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,860
Obviously, it's not the same trying to do everything virtually.

257
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,120
And there are people who I won't see who I would normally, who I will dearly miss.

258
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,840
Obviously, there is the disco and your room party, which are happening on Saturday night.

259
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,380
So hopefully they will address some of that.

260
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,500
But yeah, it's weird.

261
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,580
It's a big empty thing where there was going to be a lot of fun and drinking.

262
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,480
I mean, obviously, my bank balance is very happy about it.

263
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,300
But I don't know, my mental health, perhaps less so.

264
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,540
Well, for me, it's actually good because I probably wasn't going to make it in person.

265
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,500
And last year, I didn't make it in person.

266
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,300
And what I got was lots of people sending me photos and sending me videos and sending me gossip.

267
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,180
And it was very fun.

268
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,040
But I was in my flat going, hmm, this is a bit less fun when you're not there.

269
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,720
So for me, it's actually an upgrade because I wouldn't have been able to go to the bid session at all.

270
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
And now I can go to the bid session.

271
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,720
I wouldn't have been able to go to Alison's Room Party.

272
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,180
And now I possibly can go to Alison's Room Party if I get up very early in the morning or stay up very late at night.

273
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,400
One of those things.

274
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,000
So it's working out pretty well for me.

275
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
But I appreciate that is a strange view on it.

276
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,980
But there may be other people who weren't going to make it in person this year who now also can get these fringe benefits.

277
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,140
I really enjoyed OssieCon 4, is it?

278
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,060
The 2010 Worldcon was in Australia.

279
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,560
It was OssieCon 4.

280
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,120
Despite the fact that I wasn't there.

281
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,340
I was in Walthamstow and I helped Flick run the newsletter.

282
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,720
Flick was in Australia for OssieCon.

283
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:54,660
And what we did is that when they went to bed, I would pick up all of the outstanding news stories and write and edit an issue of the newsletter on my Mac in Walthamstow.

284
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,040
Because the newsletter system that we use, it's actually all in the cloud.

285
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,240
The formatted newsletter isn't in the cloud, but all of the text is.

286
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,200
And I did that.

287
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,400
And then they get up in the morning and just do the final edit and print.

288
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,800
And we made loads of jokes about the fact that I was doing this in Britain.

289
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,220
And nobody realised this.

290
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,220
The fact that we said so repeatedly.

291
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,280
So I did about three or four shifts on the newsletter.

292
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,960
It was actually really, really good fun.

293
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:28,540
I felt that I was enjoying the convention much more than I would have done normally a Worldcon that I couldn't be at.

294
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,320
And I have a very long experience of Worldcons I can't be at.

295
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,960
So there we go.

296
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,220
That was a good way to do it.

297
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:39,100
If I'd had more time, I'd have suggested to a person that we do a virtual newsletter for Concentric.

298
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,700
It's probably not too late, actually.

299
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,240
But anyway, no promises.

300
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,040
Not too late.

301
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,760
I did wonder whether that would be a fanzine that came out, whether someone would do a virtual newsletter.

302
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,820
And I was sort of tempted to do it.

303
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,380
I sort of thought about it about 6pm yesterday.

304
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,060
I thought I needed probably more notice than I have given myself to actually achieve anything with this.

305
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,860
Because I was going to try and do a compilation of stuff that was happening.

306
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:12,460
But it would be fun, especially for Con Zealand, it would be fun if someone did a fanzine that was a newsletter of an increasingly less and less likely Worldcon that never actually happened.

307
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,240
That could be a very good project, I think.

308
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,740
Con Zealand is working very hard to virtualise.

309
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:27,740
I had happy hour yesterday and Esther McAllen-Stewart had to run off because she's part of the Con Zealand virtualisation effort.

310
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,220
And they're having lots of really serious meetings about how you virtualise a Worldcon and what sorts of things you do.

311
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,360
I mean, I'm well used to newsletter being very much an afterthought for these sorts of things.

312
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,500
But newsletter is the sort of thing that if I were running a large virtual convention, and who knows, that might happen in the future.

313
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,680
If I were running a large virtual convention, I would definitely want to have a newsletter because that's how people find out about it.

314
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,120
And it's how you filter the stuff so that people see what's interesting.

315
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:02,400
And it should be entirely PDFs that are left in random corners of the internet so that you can't go to a single web page and just read them conveniently, right?

316
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,040
That is the newsletter that we have and that we should try and replicate that where possible.

317
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,180
You're being very hard. For the last several years now, we have actually managed to put the thing on the website quite quickly.

318
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,980
I know, I know. I'm joking. I'm joking. I speak as one who edits newsletters. I speak with love.

319
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,560
Yes. But yes, that's certainly a thing that we do.

320
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,640
My newsletters have not been on the internet, Alison.

321
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,720
Like, I am definitely part of the problem and not part of the solution in this particular regard.

322
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,320
I've done nothing.

323
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:42,380
It's really complicated because we've got to a stage in the world where people produce PDF fanzines that are meant for a fairly small group of fanzine fans to read.

324
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:48,700
And if they do that in the wrong way, those things that are contained in them can go viral badly.

325
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,040
Now, in general, I think we're OK with newsletters.

326
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,720
We've kind of got the hang of what we can and cannot put in a newsletter.

327
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:00,200
But it's certainly true that in the newsletter there are jokes that do not get into the newsletter, which is, you know, just the way of the world now.

328
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,400
And they would have got into a newsletter before the internet.

329
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:14,040
And in fact, if you can read old convention newsletters written by some very witty, witty people who would who would not be able to do that now in that way without getting into terrible, terrible trouble.

330
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:22,940
So I would say it may be too late for you to do a convention newsletter, but it's definitely not too late for you to do a one off spoof convention newsletter of a convention that's not actually happening.

331
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,120
Yes, yes.

332
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,860
I will.

333
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:31,080
I will talk to the person who was going to be running the newsletter this weekend and see how they are feeling about.

334
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,020
Oh, hello.

335
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,620
Spania's just said that she's technically the green room.

336
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,920
She's going to bring me a gin and tonic.

337
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,480
Now this, this is great.

338
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,580
What you need is someone in your house who is listening to your podcast who will bring you alcohol.

339
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,940
This is most excellent.

340
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,620
Hang on.

341
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,040
I have one moment.

342
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,780
Please bring alcohol.

343
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,340
Listener Bridget has given us some feedback on episode one in chat, which is switch controller also sounds like a sex toy.

344
00:17:59,340 --> 00:17:59,920
Yay.

345
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,040
The green room's arrived.

346
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,980
Cheers, everyone.

347
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,500
I'm not sure John heard that.

348
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,220
I did.

349
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,820
I did.

350
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,440
I heard that the switch controller sounds like a sex toy.

351
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,120
It does.

352
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,100
I was very conflicted about whether or not to leave that in because I was like, is this the right tone?

353
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,040
And then I decided to embrace it and make it the title of the episode.

354
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,020
So we've made a clear commitment.

355
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,500
So what else did we have on the list to do today?

356
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,460
Apart from talking about the fact that we're not at Eastercon.

357
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,440
We were going to congratulate someone on the podcast, I believe.

358
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,280
Well, I was anyway.

359
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,180
So congratulations to Hugo nominee Coxon.

360
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,440
Oh, yes, that's right.

361
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,320
Thank you very much.

362
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,240
Congratulations.

363
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,260
Being a Hugo nominee is awesome.

364
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,020
It is.

365
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,600
It is.

366
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,400
I get a little pin.

367
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,440
How many is that now?

368
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,240
I have two little pins, or I will have two little pins, or I will.

369
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:58,040
I have one little pin and assuming Con Zealand do little pins, given that there won't be a Worldcon at all, which is up in the air, one presumes, because shipping a bunch of little pins from New Zealand around the world might not be a good use of their resources.

370
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,560
I don't know.

371
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,400
Shipping tiny pins around the world is much cheaper than shipping massive Hugos around the world.

372
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,100
That's true.

373
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,760
That's true.

374
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,180
So I think it's going to be fine.

375
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,360
I think you'll get your pin.

376
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,080
I suspect I will not win a Hugo because the raft of other finalists is incredibly strong.

377
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:24,340
And although I think Journey Planet does great work and we are definitely in with the chance, we are also in a position where if we lost one of the other finalists, that would be thoroughly deserved.

378
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,320
But it also occurs to me that if I ever do win a Hugo, I would want it to be in a year where the Hugo was not virtue.

379
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,820
I think I would quite like it to be a physical artifact.

380
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,560
So hopefully they do shit massive chunks of metal around the world.

381
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:45,280
The really interesting thing will be, given that the rockets are made in the UK, will they have the rockets shipped to New Zealand and then shipped from New Zealand around the world?

382
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,220
Or how will that work?

383
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,060
I bet they will.

384
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,540
I'm not.

385
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,140
I don't know.

386
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,140
That's an interesting question.

387
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,680
They already announced the winners of the base design competition.

388
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,460
I can't remember who they are, but I think they are New Zealanders.

389
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:03,100
So yes, they probably will have to ship the rockets to New Zealand, put the bases on and then figure out how to dismantle them and FedEx them back to you.

390
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,920
So that's going to be fun.

391
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,180
That would be my guess.

392
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:16,200
And actually posting the little mini rocket pins to all the nominees might be better than the current situation where they tend to put them in those big envelopes that you get at registration and they all get lost in the bottom.

393
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,720
Yes.

394
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,320
I also hope I get a ribbon.

395
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,180
I don't want to be done out of a Hugo finalist ribbon.

396
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,980
So I hope they send ribbons out as well.

397
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,700
I've been a Hugo finalist.

398
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,260
Back in the days when they called them nominees rather than finalists, I've been a Hugo nominee quite a lot of times.

399
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,860
And you would think that I would have carefully stored all my pins where I could find them.

400
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,720
But I do have a couple.

401
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,640
And then Magicon did gold ones because I think it was the 50th Worldcon or the 50th Hugos or something.

402
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,040
And so I have that gold pin somewhere.

403
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:56,820
I did see one of the nominees saying, I'm thrilled to be nominated, but it's so sad that I'm being nominated in a year when I can't be at the Worldcon.

404
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:04,580
And most of the years I was nominated, I had tiny children and the Worldcon was not in the UK.

405
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:11,520
And I had years of being nominated and not being able to go to the Worldcon and desperately wanting to go to the Worldcon.

406
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,640
You know, I just wanted the whole Hugo nominees experience.

407
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:23,240
But this story has a happy ending because in 2005, the Worldcon was in Glasgow and Plotton won the Best Fanzine Award, which is, as everyone knows, the big one.

408
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:30,960
Yes. It's like Robert Silverberg was saying when he presented a Hugo at Con Jose, I think it was.

409
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,520
He got the Hugo for Best Fanwriter in the Retro Hugos.

410
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,300
And he has put it as proudly as the rest of the Hugos on his shelf because it is still a Hugo Award.

411
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:50,800
And he says he strongly suspects he won it because he is a famous author, not because the fan writing he did in that year was of the highest quality in fandom.

412
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,480
But it's still a Hugo and it still takes a proud place in his collection.

413
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,420
So, yeah, I think Fanzine is a very good one to win.

414
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,020
I don't think I'll ever win it for Fanzine, but I live in hope that I will.

415
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,400
But the nominees are just so, they're just so strong.

416
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,360
They're just so good.

417
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,660
So who are the Fanzine nominees this year?

418
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,940
The Book Smugglers, Galactic Journey, Journey Planet, Nerds of a Feather Flock Together, Quick Sip Reviews and The Rec Center.

419
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,580
So that is a strong roster.

420
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,240
I know lots of Hugo nominees.

421
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,420
Lots of people who are Hugo nominees.

422
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,220
It's really nice that so many people that I know have got nominations.

423
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,260
And that's amazing.

424
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,240
Congratulations to all.

425
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,620
I think it's a last year, Lady Business won and they are not on the ballot.

426
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:47,020
So I don't know whether they declined their nomination or I don't know whether they just haven't been active enough this year to get nominations.

427
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,800
I sort of assume it's the I sort of assume they've declined, but I don't know.

428
00:22:51,800 --> 00:23:02,420
This is why the most exciting part of the Hugos for me every year is the very end of the ceremony when the people who put the Hugos together,

429
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,100
at the very end of the thing, they produce a huge document that shows exactly what was voted for in everything.

430
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,880
All the nomination stage, all the finalist stage.

431
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,840
And it is the most fascinating thing.

432
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,400
It tells you who declined things, where you have a thing where your particular favourite missed the nomination,

433
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,780
but missed the finalist by one vote.

434
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,520
And you go, probably should have voted.

435
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,500
And all of that sort of thing.

436
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,400
I always vote.

437
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,240
I don't always vote in every category because if I don't feel particularly well informed,

438
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,420
then I don't necessarily vote in a category because I'd rather better informed people make the decision.

439
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,840
But I do always vote in at least one category.

440
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
And usually most of them.

441
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,440
Listener Neil says, stat, stat, which I wholeheartedly concur.

442
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,880
I mean, he said it more shouty than you just did it, which is impressive.

443
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,780
Sorry.

444
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,880
Listener Neil said, stats, stats.

445
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,100
That is what I wanted.

446
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,280
It's a rare case where you have to tell Alison to be more shouty.

447
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,420
It's just a spot on impression.

448
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,880
I mean, it's like he's in the room.

449
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,660
I haven't been paying enough attention to not talking to you two.

450
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,780
And I didn't notice that it was actually Hogg that started the stats chant.

451
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:17,680
So I expect it's supposed to be more like stats, stats, stats, stats, stats, stats, stats, stats, stats, stats, stats, stats, stats.

452
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,380
Why?

453
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,840
Suspicion.

454
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,740
Like a statistical Mexican way.

455
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,840
Yeah, something like that.

456
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:29,760
I have just checked and Lady Business did say they would decline the nomination in Fanzine before the nominations were announced.

457
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
So there you go.

458
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,240
Excellent.

459
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,540
I mean, excellent research on Liz's part.

460
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,520
I am not, don't mean excellent that they recused.

461
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,960
No, I still think it's a very nice, I still think it's a nice gesture when, you know, winners say, okay, we've won.

462
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,580
That was great.

463
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,140
Thank you.

464
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,440
Please check out everyone else.

465
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,660
Yeah, I think that's true.

466
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,440
I think obviously, you know, come back to me when I've won a whole library of Hugos, right?

467
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,260
Because maybe I'll feel differently if I ever actually win one.

468
00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:00,180
But I sort of feel like if you've been, if you've won three times in a row, that is about at the point where you should start thinking, is this for the best?

469
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,820
The first fan cast winner won three times in a row and then recused themselves.

470
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,500
Was it the SF Squeak cast?

471
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,820
I don't know, but we'll look it up and then you will drop it in seamlessly into the podcast, right?

472
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,000
Seamlessly.

473
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,160
Yeah, obviously.

474
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:20,700
Now, the retro Hugo ballots only attracted 120 nominations, which don't seem like very many.

475
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,760
We must be getting to the end of retro Hugos.

476
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,760
We must be running out of years for which we could award them.

477
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,280
So I worked this out and there's like another six or something.

478
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,140
We're not as close as I thought we would be.

479
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,820
The way you've said that makes it sound like you were hoping we'd be closer, Liz.

480
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,420
Do you want to talk about that some more?

481
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,940
I just, I just, I don't know.

482
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,620
I think maybe the first time I was like, oh, this is quite a neat idea.

483
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,960
We'll award the Hugos for a year.

484
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,600
We didn't do it.

485
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,560
We'll go back and look for everything and award them.

486
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:57,380
And I think it's just been kind of diminishing returns as evidenced by the number of people who actually nominate because it takes a long time to really go and inform yourself about the potential nominees.

487
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:03,280
And I think a lot of it is not based on what they did in that year or where they were in their careers up to that point.

488
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,860
It's based on kind of the whole of their careers as we saw it, especially for the Fan Awards.

489
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:16,800
So I think, I don't know, we've just reached a point where maybe it's not worth carrying on to finish them off when there are only 120 people who are particularly interested in nominating.

490
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:24,020
I'm sure there are more people interested in nominating than that, but only 120 actually got to get it onto the ballots.

491
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,780
I think I'm not a big fan of, oh, Lillian.

492
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,900
You're not a big fan of Lillian.

493
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,880
Is that what you just said?

494
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,900
Because that's very mean.

495
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,320
Welcome, Lillian.

496
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:43,600
I'm an enormous fan of Lillian, but I have muted Lillian and stopped her video, along with everyone else who's not us, for the podcast part of this.

497
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,340
And then in a bit, we'll have the bar part of it and open it back up again.

498
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm not a very big fan of the Retro Hugos.

499
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,720
I've never particularly thought they were a good thing.

500
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,340
I don't think we need more awards than we've got.

501
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,020
And then they have all those inherent problems that they're not quite doing what they think they're doing.

502
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:08,280
On the other hand, I do know people whose parents or grandparents have been awarded Retro Hugos, who've been absolutely thrilled by that.

503
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,680
That's been just the most enormous honour for them.

504
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,980
And yeah, that's quite...

505
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,400
I wouldn't personally have invented it.

506
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,140
And if I were running a Worldcon, which is not a thing that's ever going to happen,

507
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:26,340
I would be in the class of people going, well, we could theoretically award Retro Hugos, but we're not going to do that, if at all possible.

508
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,060
I think it's one of those things where it's a nice idea, but it would be...

509
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,460
It's very difficult to do it well.

510
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:39,720
I think it's a really nice idea to go back to the years where there were no Hugos and Awardworks Hugos for the years that didn't get them.

511
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,020
Why?

512
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:51,920
Because I think it's cool to have a view of what Worldcon thinks the best work was in each year that Worldcon existed.

513
00:27:52,120 --> 00:28:02,660
Having said that, I share both of your concerns that the actual process of doing Retro Hugos has not, in fact, achieved that goal.

514
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:09,020
Because I think people do win who are still active in the field for things that perhaps they weren't really the best.

515
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:17,960
And I also think that I sort of feel like there is a slant here where a lot of science fiction fans, and I count myself in this, are completionists.

516
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,380
And we don't like seeing an uncomplete set. If you've got a set, it should be a complete set.

517
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,660
And if you don't have a complete set, what was the point in the set?

518
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,600
And so I think there is an element here of the completionism being the driving factor.

519
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,280
And I'm not sure completionism is a good enough reason to do it.

520
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:41,680
I would be more comfortable with it if it was a juried award, where like 10 people who are very knowledgeable go away and research and say, here are the people we think should be given the Hugos.

521
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,340
But then that doesn't really jive with the principle of the Hugos being awarded by the Worldcon fandom.

522
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,080
So I don't know. I don't know that there's a good way of getting around the problem.

523
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,740
And so I am an R.

524
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:59,320
Equally, I'm quite happy for the people who like it to keep doing it and I don't really have to pay attention, which is usually my view on many things.

525
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,780
So as long as the people doing it are happy, I don't really mind.

526
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,340
That's not nearly inflammatory enough, is it?

527
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,900
I tried.

528
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,400
Kent Bloom has said, do you want to be remembered as the best fanzine except for X?

529
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,300
I think there are cases where you do have like the obviously finest thing of the year.

530
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:23,580
This much more happens in novels where people who've won a few novels take their jaw-dropping novel out of the Hugos.

531
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:29,700
But I think for fanzine, I think, for example, when Plockta won, we were probably the best fanzine that wasn't answerable.

532
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:37,360
And, you know, A, Plockta, I think I should state now, Plockta has never been, was never the best fanzine of the year.

533
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,600
Not at any time.

534
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,200
That's not what the Hugos are not actually awarded for the best things.

535
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,800
They're awarded for the things that people enjoy.

536
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,600
There's a word, there's a form of word.

537
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,440
It's something like the things that you enjoyed the most over the year and want to see nominated or something like that.

538
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:59,700
But I don't think anyone goes now, oh, that award won in a year, but three fanzines had removed themselves from the ballot.

539
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:08,420
I don't think that's a problem, except in the case where you have something like, you know, a film or a movie or a book that was like the thing that everyone talked about all year.

540
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,300
And then the creators took it off the ballot.

541
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,180
That's a little bit different.

542
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,460
But even then, I don't think anyone will remember 10 years later.

543
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,860
They would just go, oh, that's what won the Hugo in that year, is it?

544
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,200
So yes, I'm very happy, very proud to have awards for the best fanzine that wasn't Ansible in 2005 and 2006.

545
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,640
But you say Ansible is the best fanzine, but certainly I laugh more at Plockter than I do at Ansible.

546
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,140
But I find out a lot less actual information about upcoming events in Plockter than I do at Ansible.

547
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,020
So it really does depend on what you want.

548
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:46,100
In some ways, I think you can make a coherent argument that Ansible is the best fanzine.

549
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,880
And in some ways, it's clearly not.

550
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,280
And I don't know.

551
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,220
I don't mind winning.

552
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,500
I think the thing is, if I ever win a Hugo, I'll be over the bloody moon.

553
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,580
And I'm not going to be worried about whether or not I won it in a year that anyone recused themselves.

554
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:07,440
And arguably, the fact that Far 4 770 recused itself in advance means that we don't know whether it would have been nominated.

555
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,760
Like, he said he would recuse himself so people didn't nominate him.

556
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,980
But how do you tell?

557
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,620
I don't know.

558
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,560
It's a very hard question.

559
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,600
But I'll be over the moon if I ever win a Hugo.

560
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,420
So yes, that is, I think, my answer.

561
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,920
I recommend winning a Hugo.

562
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:26,080
I especially, I recommend winning a Hugo at a convention you're at because it's the best thing.

563
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,880
It really is.

564
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
It was absolutely amazing.

565
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,540
Loved it.

566
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,400
Will never happen again.

567
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,360
But it was a lot of fun.

568
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,980
If anyone's been hearing rattling, I have now located my Hugo pin.

569
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,720
Zoom is very helpfully making it part of the background.

570
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,080
It's very difficult to actually show because it's very thin.

571
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,980
We can see it.

572
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,560
And I will put a link in the show notes.

573
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,880
You know, everyone knows what this looks like.

574
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,580
Not everyone.

575
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,960
Tobes doesn't pay attention.

576
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,060
Tobes is in the audience.

577
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,260
Hi, Tobes.

578
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,080
Tobes has confirmed that he doesn't pay attention in the chat.

579
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,940
But that's a paradox because for him to have noticed I mentioned that, he would have had to have been paying attention.

580
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,380
So we have ourselves a logic trap on our hands.

581
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,500
Tobes pays more attention than you think.

582
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,020
Next is probably audience questions.

583
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,460
Because I'm sure everyone is very keen to know what we think about things.

584
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,980
While we're asking for people to write questions, we will talk about what we're doing to stay sane in the apocalypse.

585
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,640
What are you doing to stay sane in the apocalypse?

586
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,100
So I have still obstinately not been doing any reading.

587
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,300
I haven't read any of my book since the first episode where I mentioned the book I was reading.

588
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,240
I have been playing an awful lot of board games.

589
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,760
I've been playing a board game, which I actually have here, called Marvel Champions.

590
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,460
It is a great game.

591
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,720
I bought it before the apocalypse.

592
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,820
And it turns out it's a very good single player.

593
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,160
So I've been playing that on my own.

594
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,780
And then I've been playing a game called Arkham Horror the Card Game with various people, including my wife.

595
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,280
And we played some of that this morning.

596
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,220
Playing PlayStation.

597
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,360
Been watching TV.

598
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,800
Watched Bought Knives Out and watched that.

599
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,180
And watched Rear Window, the Hitchcock movie, which is really, really good.

600
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,880
So I've been watching more movies.

601
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,120
So how's your screen time been?

602
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,340
My screen time, I would say about the same as normal, actually.

603
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,200
I don't think it's significantly gone up.

604
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
So about 17 hours a day, then.

605
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,460
Well, the thing is, as someone who works in an office whose job is predominantly making code go,

606
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,100
yes, probably about that.

607
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,200
Because eight hours a day for work and then plus whatever leisure.

608
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,540
But I'm very fortunate in that I have not been furloughed and my work does not need me to be anywhere in particular.

609
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,820
I think I am incredibly lucky in that regard.

610
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,200
And Espana is also still full time.

611
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,640
So we are both, I think, very lucky.

612
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,380
I'm not really thinking of it as screen time.

613
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,700
Because, I mean, it is screen time.

614
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:40,340
But it's also chatting to friends time, watching people on Zoom and Teams time, you know, sending WhatsApp messages time.

615
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,240
I mean, so I live alone.

616
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,560
And the furthest I've been since Saturday morning is to the car park to collect my groceries when I'm out of my groceries.

617
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:55,040
So if I didn't, like, spend my screen time chatting to people, then I literally would not have spoken to another human being for a week.

618
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,460
So really, the screen time is what is keeping me going.

619
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,520
But yeah, actually, I'm doing okay.

620
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,120
I don't seem to have that much free time.

621
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,500
I'm not sure how John is fitting in board games and TV and video games and books.

622
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,800
Because I seem to spend all my time now hoovering and doing the washing up.

623
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,320
Oh, I did say I would plug.

624
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,780
So I've been doing my daily exercises in front of the TV to YouTube videos to a channel called Team Body Project.

625
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,920
So you can go and Google them.

626
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:25,160
And they have a bunch of free videos on YouTube of, like, all levels from beginner to really quite hard work exercise.

627
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,560
And some of them you can tailor, like, high impact, low impact, based on what you want to do.

628
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,620
And they've got someone demonstrating both on screen.

629
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,360
So that's really good.

630
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:41,440
After talking about it for about three weeks, I finally got to the point where I have my dancing mat plugged into the television.

631
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,080
The amount of tidying up that's required for the living in the living room is quite a lot.

632
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,920
And I have got my PlayStation 2 going.

633
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:56,540
And I am playing Dancing Stage Fusion, which is Dance Dance Revolution for people who don't remember the 90s and the early 2000s.

634
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,920
And it is a game where, as the music plays, you have to move your feet in time with the music.

635
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,000
It's the best thing ever.

636
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,560
I did this because I had been trying now for it.

637
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:14,120
When Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure, which is a game that you're supposed to play to get you fit whilst also playing a fantasy game, came out,

638
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,220
I decided I was buying nothing and so I did not need this thing.

639
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,980
At the start, at the very beginning of the apocalypse, before people had realised it was the apocalypse,

640
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:27,440
I decided I would, after all, get a copy of Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure to discover it.

641
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,060
It was unattainable everywhere.

642
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:36,500
And so this is my methadone for the new posh game, which is an old but nevertheless excellent game that will keep you fit.

643
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,320
And I started it yesterday, so I now have a streak of one consecutive days of hitting my Apple movement target,

644
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,740
which is not bad.

645
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,900
I feel like a slice target is better than...

646
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,240
Because otherwise I'd just be essentially animating myself as a slug for a fortnight.

647
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,040
And then I finished playing this game, got some water, went down to rest,

648
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,580
and stockinformer.com told me that Ring Fit Adventure was in stock at Amazon France.

649
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,440
So I have a French copy of Ring Fit Adventure, a wigging is meant to me in the near future.

650
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,860
I see various people in the comments are recommending Beat Saber.

651
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,720
And as I had a go at that in Dublin this year, it is amazing.

652
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,080
And if I had like the VR headset and everything, I would be playing that.

653
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,820
That's a lot of money though, isn't it?

654
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,780
You need an actual Oculus Rift thing or a headset.

655
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,820
I think you could do it on PSVR.

656
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,960
So you could do it for somewhere in the region of £300 to £400, I think.

657
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,180
But yes, that's still not an insurmountable amount of cash.

658
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,840
OK, we have a lot of questions.

659
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,120
Patrick McMurray says that he read an article somewhere which said

660
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,000
humanity was failing at apocalypse on the easy level.

661
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,060
What do you think?

662
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,240
I saw an article that said that we are getting the R of the coronavirus

663
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,240
down to nearly one in several countries, or at least one within errors.

664
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,920
So I'm feeling pretty optimistic about our reaction to the apocalypse.

665
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,180
You know, notable edge cases notwithstanding.

666
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,380
What do you two think?

667
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,100
Are we doing well?

668
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,700
How do we know if we're doing well?

669
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,780
Liz, you're an expert.

670
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,500
I haven't been thinking of it as an apocalypse, although maybe that's just because

671
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,980
it is better for my mental health not to assume I am in an apocalypse.

672
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,760
I don't think we're doing amazingly well, but I don't think we're doing appallingly badly.

673
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,420
I think we're somewhere in the middle.

674
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,060
It's taking us a while to make the responses that we need to make.

675
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,560
And I think we're reacting a bit now rather than planning ahead for what we're going to do next.

676
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,560
But we are kind of succeeding in a circumstance that I'm not sure people had really planned for this.

677
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,360
Like I think people had planned for, you know, they'd looked at SARS and take an example of SARS,

678
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,160
but SARS was like different in several crucial ways from the current coronavirus.

679
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,480
And so, you know, maybe you couldn't quite use, if you're taking that as your example,

680
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,040
maybe you would plan to do things that wouldn't actually be effective.

681
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,300
But I think we're somewhere in the middle.

682
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,400
We're not doing appallingly.

683
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,860
We're not doing amazingly well.

684
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:57,800
There are obvious examples of places which, you know, I just look at what they're doing and I shake my head.

685
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,180
And it's on a macro scale.

686
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,880
Like I see countries doing the wrong thing.

687
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,620
And on sort of a micro scale, you can see, you know, people in niche areas coming up with the wrong conclusions

688
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,400
and writing bad papers and things like that.

689
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,240
But I think we're sort of the moment on a middle ground.

690
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,360
Is that the world or the UK?

691
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,580
Oh, the world mostly, because I think I'm not quite as au fait with how the UK is doing.

692
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,220
And it's hard for me to judge because I can't go out and see what's happening there.

693
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,720
I can't go out and see if there are people around or kind of get a feel for what's going on with your neighbours.

694
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,620
But then I guess no one can really do that anymore.

695
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,760
Lillian says, do you think the pandemic will see a resurgence of fanzines or appers?

696
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,840
And I would like to point out, I think we started a podcast in reaction, at least partly to the fact we were going to have a lot more time on our hands.

697
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,920
And I've been editing my Taft report.

698
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,960
So I think there is a more fan act happening.

699
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,580
What do you think?

700
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:54,600
We were planning the podcast well in advance of lockdown, to be fair.

701
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,520
It just happened that the lockdown gave us the impetus to actually get on with it.

702
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,160
But it's been in trade for a little while.

703
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,020
I seem to be doing quite a lot of fan act at the moment.

704
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:20,460
But in fact, lots of things for which I like the peace and quiet of my own normally quiet study have been very seriously disrupted by the fact that I now have a husband who is working for full time in my quiet, peaceful study.

705
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:26,500
And a daughter who is studying for her final term at Oxford in the peace and quiet of my study.

706
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:33,120
And a son who is playing Switch games quite loudly, very close to the peace and quiet of my study.

707
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,780
And it's actually very hard to get anything done at all.

708
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,420
That's fair.

709
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:43,300
I am currently coming to you from a virtual environment so unsuitable for doing a podcast that I'm not ever going to remove that virtual background.

710
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,680
Oh, but I've bought a green screen.

711
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,760
You've bought a green screen?

712
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,940
I've bought a green screen.

713
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,820
Just a cheap one.

714
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,960
That is definitely something that wouldn't happen if the apocalypse hadn't, right?

715
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:59,200
I don't think Zoom and other such conferencing tools have made green screens look a lot more sensible than they did three weeks ago.

716
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,460
When I got the Robson Award, it came with money.

717
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,860
And that was very nice.

718
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,000
And I've been using the money for doing some slightly fannish things.

719
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,380
And it struck me that seeing as I seem to be spending a lot of my time doing fan activity online, buying a green screen was a suitable thing.

720
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,580
I just live in a very beige environment, so I don't need a green screen.

721
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,000
My environment is very busy.

722
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,180
I have laundry behind me, which helps my acoustics.

723
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:27,640
But it does make green screens a lot harder because it's all patterns, as you can tell from my t-shirt choices.

724
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,180
So I did ask whether the games I was mentioning were playable online.

725
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,500
And I will put a link in the show notes.

726
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,340
But the short answer is if you get a game called Tabletop Simulator, you can play many different board games online.

727
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,440
And the two I mentioned are indeed available through that.

728
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:50,800
And Nick Upson has asked which book, film or other story best predicted the current situation and behaviours, do you think?

729
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,540
This is why you probably wouldn't go to us for your serious science fictional panel, isn't it?

730
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,340
Because I'm now thinking about this and I'm not sure.

731
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:02,660
But Charlie Strauss did say he had a whole treatment for a novel that was based on this thing.

732
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:11,900
And he had this idea that, as we know from history, people do pull together in difficult times much more than science fiction tends to predict that they will.

733
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,620
A couple of people have recommended them.

734
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,940
I have been reading Europe in Autumn, which somebody mentions down the thread, that does indeed.

735
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,240
It's a balkanised Europe following pandemic.

736
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,420
So I don't know whether that's how we're going to end.

737
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,120
It feels to me like Europe's pulling together quite well with us not in it.

738
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,740
Lily and I should, should we all dress up for your party?

739
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,880
And I feel like you should dress as you would normally on the Saturday night of an Eastercon.

740
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,740
Or not as you choose.

741
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,900
Just, I mean, wear something.

742
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,840
It's not a clothes optional party.

743
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,920
Wear something unless you want me to stop your video.

744
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,840
Neil has recommended Song for a New Day by Sarah Pinsker and Severance by Ling Ma.

745
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:54,640
I will say that has made me think we probably should work out which Kim Stanley Robinson, Three Californias we would like to be and see if we can get there.

746
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,200
Zoe has asked, and I think this is a great question.

747
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,700
Are you all desperately looking for new things to watch and read or love watching and reading favourite old stuff?

748
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,780
I am watching new stuff because I am watching Buffy.

749
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,540
And Espania is watching favourite old stuff because she is watching Buffy.

750
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,020
And so that is how that's happening in my house.

751
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,660
Espania is using this as an opportunity to get me to watch lots of things.

752
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:25,020
But I think mostly I have watched so little television that everything is pretty much new to me.

753
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,300
So that's a hard question.

754
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,220
What about you two?

755
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,120
I'm watching less television than usual.

756
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:35,780
But that is because we are playing Animal Crossing on the Switch for almost every waking moment because there are three of us.

757
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,940
And one of us is a one of those three people is is a Animal Crossing completist, which is not a thing I ever realised could happen.

758
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,260
And the other two are Animal Crossing dilettantes and keep going.

759
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,700
Could we just get on for 30 minutes in daytime so we can catch the daytime fish, please?

760
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,220
I think I'm doing a bit of both.

761
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:57,120
Like I'll read something new, but I'm not reading anything, I guess, super demanding.

762
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,940
I have gone back to some Terry Pratchett because that's my comfort read.

763
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,920
It's a good comfort read.

764
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,440
Very good.

765
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,040
This is a statement, I think.

766
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,760
Next live podcast happens with everyone dancing.

767
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,100
I mean, it won't happen with me dancing.

768
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,160
I'm happy for it to happen with everyone else dancing.

769
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,500
I will be the person not dancing in the middle.

770
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,080
Unless we record a podcast at the disco.

771
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,920
But that seems like it might be too many podcasts in too short a time.

772
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,120
Max has recommended Oculus Quest for getting Beat Saber.

773
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,780
And Lillian asked, will the pandemic rescue the VR industry or will no one ever want to do VR again?

774
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,020
I don't have VR, so I am spectacularly badly placed to answer that.

775
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,160
Do either of you have a VR thing?

776
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,980
I do not.

777
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:50,340
But I understand that you can get some sort of like fancy setup for your conference room or meeting room where you sort of get a VR or some kind of like fancy projection of the whole person.

778
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:55,500
And people were just starting to talk about this sort of before we all went into doing video conferences all the time.

779
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,780
Because I already did a lot of video conferences, but now I do only video conferences.

780
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,440
And I think that is going to become a lot more popular.

781
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,620
I think people will realise that maybe you don't need to do everything in person.

782
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,080
But maybe it would be good if you could see the actual kind of hologram of a person.

783
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,660
I'm going to have to find a link to this weird hologram thing as well.

784
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:19,380
I have only ever had the very cheap sorts of VR rigs, which are the ones where you slot your phone into a bunch of lenses.

785
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,820
What I do do is stereo photography.

786
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:28,660
I have a phone just so that I can look at stereo photos on it that is not made by Apple because Apple's never putting a 3D screen on a phone.

787
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:33,520
And I have used a lot of VR headsets in order to do 3D stuff.

788
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,560
You know, the stereo realist is 70 years old now, nearly.

789
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,160
And there are medium format cameras to look at stereo pictures that are just amazing.

790
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,880
Bridget asked, will everyone now want green screen colour T-shirts with amusing hovering designs on?

791
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,160
And the answer to that is no.

792
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,200
I also know why it's really difficult to make that happen.

793
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,380
But that's very boring.

794
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,140
And you need to ask me in a bar where, you know, when there's not 15 people in the room.

795
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,440
Just take me into a corner somewhere.

796
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,960
So like in the bar we're about to have?

797
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,900
Like in the bar we're about to have.

798
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,480
Excellent.

799
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,420
Somebody has said, also Bridget, how can you feed your triples if there's no quadraticale in the shop?

800
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,160
I wasn't going to read that because I can't pronounce that word.

801
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,280
I can't pronounce that word.

802
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,140
I think that's funny.

803
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,340
Quadraticale.

804
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,020
Whoa!

805
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,360
I can just superimpose that into Alison and hope no one notices.

806
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:22,960
It'll be fine.

807
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,540
You can.

808
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,280
That's right.

809
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,380
Quadraticale.

810
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,260
In the shops.

811
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,740
Yeah.

812
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:33,400
And we have one final question, which is, will this encourage us after this to travel less

813
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,260
and save the planet?

814
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,400
And that's from Lillian.

815
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,200
I don't know.

816
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,200
I don't know.

817
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,860
Because the thing I'm really missing is travelling.

818
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:45,720
And so I am a little bit of the opinion that people might actually decide to get out a bit

819
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,360
more after a few months of enforced isolation.

820
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,880
I could see it going that way.

821
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:56,660
But if the benefit to the environment is very, very clear as a result of the lack of travel,

822
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:01,960
it might mean that environmental lobbies have an easier time influencing policymakers in the future.

823
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,100
I don't know.

824
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,720
I think that leisure travel is going to be very popular.

825
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,920
But I think some business travel, people will start to go, you know what, now that we've

826
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,000
all got video conferencing set up and we're used to it and we're all familiar with it,

827
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,440
we maybe didn't need to do quite so many trips in person.

828
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,160
I'd be up for, and on travel rationing as well, I'd be up for saying,

829
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,000
no person is allowed to take more than 10 journeys a year.

830
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,700
Sort it out.

831
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,360
You can buy your ration off people.

832
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,560
I mean, I do think like in terms of sort of conferences and stuff,

833
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:38,480
it's always struck me that a lot of the knowledge could be acquired remotely without needing to go.

834
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,080
The problem, I guess, is the networking is much easier in person.

835
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,980
So I don't know.

836
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,060
I don't know how that's going to go.

837
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,960
I don't know whether businesses will react in one of those ways.

838
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,140
My response to you, John, would be that actually virtual conferences,

839
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:57,480
are a great leveller for people who come from countries where they can't afford to go to

840
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,300
conferences regularly.

841
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,080
So they're actually good for that.

842
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,940
Yeah, I completely agree with that.

843
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,760
So that's the end of another thrilling episode of Octothorpe,

844
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,440
the podcast about science fiction and SF fandom.

845
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,960
So it's goodbye from me.

846
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,160
And it's goodbye from me.

847
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,380
And it's goodbye from me.

848
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:18,800

850
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:34,920
We should stop and then everyone can have a chat and a drink.

851
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,400
I've got a beer with my name on it waiting in the fridge.

852
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,460
Like literally, did you write on with a pen and everything?

853
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,280
No, I just decided I was going to drink it in my head.

854
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,460
I'm going to turn off my recording though, John.

855
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:45,960
What?

856
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,000
I'm going to keep mine on in case I say anything devilishly witty.

857
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,820
It's a good plan.

858
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,760
It seems unlikely.

859
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,180
I'm going to stop mine because I'm all out of wit.
