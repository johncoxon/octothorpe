1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 who would like to do one. You can do one, John.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:23,840
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 86th episode of Octa Thorpe, a podcast for science fiction

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,760
 and science fiction fandom. This episode is coming to you on the 22nd of June 2023. I'm John Coxin.

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:39,680
 I'm Alison Scott and I'm Liz Batty and we have some letters of comments. Abigail Nussbaum wrote

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,760
 and said that we did a very good job of timing our podcast exactly to fit in with her commute,

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,960
 so you know glad to be of service. Please write in with the length of your evening

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,680
 commutes and we'll see what we can do. And she said a great discussion of a face-like glass

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,200
 and I'm not just saying that because I agreed with all your points. We're very pleased to have made

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,680
 points that Abigail agreed with because she's one of them clever people who knows a lot of stuff,

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,760
 so that was lovely. Abigail's like you. She has also given her official Francis Harding ranking

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,560
 for our future selection or anyone's future selection and that list I'm going to run

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:41,440
 through it very quickly is Fly by Night and Twilight Robbery at the top and then Verde

13
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,400
 at some point. That's my plan. Thank you very much Abigail. I'm not sure this list is actually in order,

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,000
 but Abigail writing and tell us if we completely misrepresented it. Oh no, it's not in order.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,880
 My dust donsers. I just totally misread it. It's got more nuance than that. Abigail would never

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,120
 just send us a list in order. It's a nuanced ranking of which ones we should pick to read next.

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:10,080
 Like I went and bought a book face on a seat also. It succeeded. Okay, that was completely rubbish.

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,520
 So actually, Gullstruck Island was her favourite, which is called the Lost Conspiracy of the US

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,440
 and she says, "hands down my favourite Harding." So that's the one she recommends to anyone who

20
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,320
 asks if you were asking. They're just going to take my brownies readers badge away because I clearly

21
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:36,240
 cannot read and comprehend simple English text. We also heard from Christopher J Garcia who pointed

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,080
 out that they didn't do a Hugo recommendations issue of the drink tank. And I discovered this

23
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,440
 while trying to look it up for the show notes and finding that there was not one. And so I

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,360
 would have mentioned it if you hadn't Chris. What's happened? Look right, I expect a certain level

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,200
 of service and frankly, hmm, you're never going to win another Hugo with this attitude.

26
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:07,120
 And then, other things. He says he doesn't get many DMs on Insta but he does have a lot of

27
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,960
 friends who are porn stars. So, you know, that's data that is. That's good to know. Thanks Chris.

28
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,920
 Chris is also fairly certain there's going to be a whole bunch of Chinese stuff on the Hugo

29
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:25,040
 ballot. So agreeing with me there. Foreshadowing. Is it foreshadowing or a segue?

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:37,040
 Oh, it could be a segue. A segue. Yes. So, Chengdu posted to their socials to make an announcement

31
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,400
 about Hugo Awards. I will read out verbatim. Sorry folks, but due to the amount and complexity

32
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560
 of this year's nominations, we have received the committee still needs some time to work out

33
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,520
 the official nomination list. Be assured that we are working very hard to reach the completion line,

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,240
 maybe one more week to go. And that was posted two days ago. So by the time you listen to this,

35
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,360
 it may indeed be out, but we did say that last week as well. So, yes. Also, it should be official

36
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,480
 finalist list. And frankly, I think it's appalling that no one from the Waspous Division caught that

37
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,520
 before that message was posted. Shame. Shame. But more seriously, I think we all three of us agree

38
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,520
 that that message makes us think there's probably going to be some Chinese nominees on the ballot

39
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,160
 or at the very least, some Chinese nominees on the long list. I mean, because I guess it's

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
 theoretically possible that they could control the numbers. And then it turns out none of the

41
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,520
 Chinese nominees get on the ballot, but it seems unlikely. Yes. So yeah, I assume from that it means

42
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:44,320
 things are complex for one or both of two reasons. One is that the ballots have come in with lots

43
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,360
 of stuff on there being represented in multiple ways, which we know is a problem, right? Because

44
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,800
 people can write, you know, things with hyphens, things with quote marks, things in funny orders,

45
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
 like you always have to go through and kind of tidy up the data to make sure you've got the

46
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,440
 nominations correct. But then if you're trying to do that, tidying up across two different languages,

47
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,400
 that is going to be even more a problem. The other thing I know is that they are using different

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,440
 software, I think, than previous years, which may be because this software better supports

49
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,680
 multilingual nominations. But it may be that kind of things are slightly less smooth because they

50
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,360
 are using different software and you've got different teething problems. I'm fine with it. You

51
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,480
 know, there's still plenty of time before the actual convention. And they've said, okay, yeah,

52
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,440
 it's taking us a little bit longer. Give us a bit of time. Fair enough. Yep. Means I might be right,

53
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,360
 though. So obviously good with me. It does mean that. It does. I think that's quite likely.

54
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,480
 Better get learning Chinese. Read all the finalists. Like, because, you know, if they're all in Chinese,

55
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,640
 how will I meet the Briarly Competence threshold if, if I don't know any Chinese? I do. I will know

56
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,720
 in a discussion of this noted critic Nick Clark. She said she thinks she has only once in her

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,680
 entire history of voting in the hue goes red or watched everything shortlisted in a given category

58
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,200
 anyway. So that is a counterpoint to the Briarly Competence threshold, which I enthusiastically endorse.

59
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,600
 What in any category? Yes. I think that is a much better use of one's time than trying to read

60
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,600
 everything out of a sense of nobility or obligation. Read stuff you like and then do what you want.

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,240
 I think it's quite nice to do everything in a category. It gives you a kind of feeling of,

62
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,360
 I don't know, smug superiority and internet chat. All that topic. I mean, I will say,

63
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,640
 I don't think I have ever read, for example, all the nominees in Best Series in a given year.

64
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,680
 I have managed Best Novel and I think I've managed the entirety of short fiction ballots and so on.

65
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,480
 But yeah, definitely categories I haven't read everything in. I've done all of Best Series before.

66
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,040
 I mean, I do tend to read all of the categories I vote in, but I just think you shouldn't. It's not

67
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,240
 a stick to beat yourself with or it shouldn't be. It should be a positive, lovely experience,

68
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,200
 not a stressful, awful one. Much like life. I can say that I never find you

69
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,600
 go voting to be particularly stressful and awful, even if I haven't read anything, read everything

70
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,360
 even. To be fair, Liz, you find nothing stressful or awful on account of how you are basically one

71
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,520
 of the most laid-back people in the universe. I would describe you as horizontal, especially

72
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,880
 because you're knitting in bed right now. I always relax. I just like have a very go with the flow

73
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:36,400
 attitude, which not always the best way to do things, but does lead to a maybe less stressful

74
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,040
 life than otherwise. Also, I recommend crochet. Oh, sorry. Liz is crocheting in bed right now.

75
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,440
 I always get those mixed up. I can't actually knit so uh. Yeah, I actually,

76
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,880
 I actually sell a t-shirt that was suggested to me by Kylie Ding and Robin Stevenson that says

77
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:05,520
 vule vu crochet a vet. That's quite good. We also, so Hugo Administrator Dave McCarty posted to

78
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:14,800
 their Facebook about the venue for Chengdu and and yeah, they've gone from a field to a conference

79
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,400
 centre in a year. And you know, I don't know how many people got concussed or severely injured doing

80
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,840
 that or or what the human toll was, but it is very impressive. Oh, I don't, you probably don't want

81
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,240
 to know the health and safety figures, but if you did, you probably couldn't find them. That's

82
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,840
 the thing, right? It's tricky because I see this and all of that is very impressive, but we know how

83
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,200
 countries like this do these things this quickly and it's by not giving a crap about the people

84
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
 who are doing the work. Shall we move on to the much less controversial topic of COVID?

85
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,840
 The Smoth News newsletter written by Patreia Mitchell basically is generally a massive list of

86
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,400
 conventions with a little bit of commentary at the top and it comes out about once every week.

87
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:11,760
 I think, um, but I just read it for the bit at the top. There is a new guidance from the CDC

88
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,120
 in conjunction with the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers

89
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,840
 or ASHRAE and they have picked a number to aim for in terms of COVID circulation of five air

90
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,680
 changes per hour, which is absolutely like, I like this because it's a number that you could be like,

91
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,000
 yeah, we can benchmark against the number now and that's nice and it means we can stop talking about,

92
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,440
 well, I mean, maybe not immediately, but this is the first step on the way to sort of having

93
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,160
 arguments about what the phrase well ventilated means and starting to get towards a more,

94
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,600
 um, quantitative discussion of these things, which I think would be quite good. I thought it was

95
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,720
 interesting and that I thought I would mention it on the podcast. Yeah, so it's very interesting

96
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,760
 because when I've been looking at like air purifiers and things, because I own a home air purifier,

97
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:12,240
 they generally have this value, it calls CADR rating, which is the clean air delivery rate.

98
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,240
 So basically it's like kind of the, and it comes in, in for mine, it comes in like meters cubed per

99
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,840
 hour. So basically if a thing tells me this clean is like 200 meters cubed per hour, then you can

100
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,600
 work out the size of your room and from that workout, like whether this purifier is enough to give you

101
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,120
 five complete air changes per hour or whatever. So yeah, it's quite, I think it's quite a good

102
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
 standard. You have to then work out the size of your room and work out the efficiency of your

103
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,200
 purifier, but then you can basically have one of appropriate size in appropriate space,

104
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,080
 in appropriate size spaces, which is quite handy. Right, it's just being like, I'm going to buy a

105
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,960
 big air purifier and put it in the corner of this room and assume it's all fine. I just like, as a

106
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,040
 physicist, what I want is numbers. And so any numbers I view as good, good numbers. So I have

107
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,080
 some numbers, um, because I've just been googling furiously. Um, as always, when somebody says,

108
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,440
 here's what America is doing, I go, oh, there are other places in the world. So I checked to see if

109
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,800
 the Health and Safety Executive has, um, advice on ventilation, which it does. And its advice on

110
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:24,400
 ventilation is, um, five to eight liters of clean air supply per occupant of the space per second.

111
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,720
 So you can probably turn that into air changes an hour. Um, I would have thought that was rather

112
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,080
 less than, um, five air changes an hour in most workplaces, but I don't know.

113
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,800
 Is that, is the Health and Safety Executive? Have you got a link? Could I haven't read that?

114
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,800
 I've put a link to its ventilation pages. It's COVID pages when it talks about ventilation in,

115
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,480
 in respect of COVID, um, points to the general ventilation pages. It says that ventilation is

116
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,800
 just the same as COVID as for everything, all the other reasons why ventilation is important in

117
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,000
 workplaces. I think the CDC ones are better because they explicitly say, you know,

118
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,360
 they explicitly include, and this is what we are recommending based on COVID being an important

119
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,000
 thing, as well as all the other things for clean air changes, things like HEPA filters,

120
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,520
 you know, the, the rating of your HEPA filters, uh, you know, and so on. And also suggesting things

121
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:26,000
 like UV inactivation, you know, which is a, not a thing for all, you know, there's reasons for having

122
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,960
 air ventilation. Like the reason I know about like clean air delivery changes and so on is because

123
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,120
 my air purifier was bought for pollution, where you don't bother with like the germicidal standards.

124
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,000
 So I think it is worth, you know, making sure that they have taken COVID specifically into account

125
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,520
 and not just gone, you know, for what they had before.

126
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,880
 But they have done, but because it's a, this is in fact an outlet of the British government,

127
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,520
 I'm sure that John is right when he says it reflects government guidelines. Yeah, I like the CDC one

128
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,920
 better. As I said, five to eight liters a second. And the point about that one that's good is that

129
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,080
 it's per occupant, whereas the CDC one is per room. And I'll tell you that really puts the

130
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,920
 heebie-jeebies in me because the room with no people in it will not develop, you know,

131
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,960
 how much you pack the room does matter a lot here. And they, and that, and that recommendation

132
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,080
 takes no account of it. Our cinemas were saying when they reopened cinemas, they said they were

133
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,320
 changing the air every seven minutes, which is like, I guess, eight times an hour. So it's a bit

134
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
 more than that, but not a lot. But I do think that the number of people in the room is highly

135
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,120
 relevant to this. So I don't, I don't, I'm not just sort of instantly believing the CDC's

136
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,280
 recommendation here, any more than anything else. I think there are, like everything here,

137
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:46,800
 there's room for a range of views. It's worth, it's worth noting that the CDC makes it clear that

138
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,600
 five air changes an hour is the minimum. And they do note that it's not clear how that scales up for

139
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,240
 like extremely large numbers of people. I'm just deeply suspicious of what I don't want,

140
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,560
 because like, unless there's evidence that the health and safety executive has updated that

141
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:12,400
 ventilation advice from 2019, I, what I'm interested in is how the science has developed in light of

142
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:20,560
 the fact that we've had a pandemic. And I don't have much interest in pre pandemic opinions on this,

143
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,560
 because they don't seem particularly relevant. And so like, if the British government, I mean,

144
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,080
 I agree, like, you know, and I'm very sorry that I posted an American thing without

145
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,840
 checking whether or not there was a British equivalent. But at the same time, if the British

146
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,200
 equivalent is we had guidance on this before and here it is, then I think that's a sign that

147
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,360
 they're lagging. So I agree with you. And I think you were right. And that the UK are just using the

148
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
 same old guidelines and the CDC have actually thought about it and based it on Atlantic Commission

149
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,080
 recommendation. So it has a key table, which we're going to link to, which is table one. And what

150
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:55,760
 it basically says is that the it counts by two different mechanisms, which are per volume

151
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,240
 volumetric flow for air changes, where it says, good is for better is six and best is better than

152
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,920
 six. So the CDC's recommendation of five is kind of firmly there as between good and better. And it

153
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:17,280
 also has a volumetric flow per person, which it recommends. And that is the good is 10 liters per

154
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,760
 second per person, which your notice is significantly more than the HSE recommendations. So in conclusion,

155
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,720
 what that means is that the health and safety executive has not yet updated its guidelines to

156
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,920
 take account of the Lancet Committee. So if you're listening to this HSE, get your figure out.

157
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,200
 And thank you for listening. We're thrilled that we have so many people in the civil service as

158
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:52,880
 fans. And all the subject of 2025, Seattle is the only worldcom that has submitted any filing

159
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,320
 paperwork. Oh wait, is that when was the deadline? Was it deadline? Did I miss the deadline?

160
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,440
 Deadline for site selection. Shit, were you gonna biddlers? I mean, obviously, I wasn't personally

161
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,080
 gonna bid, but normally I am on top of all things with this constitution. And I've been slacking

162
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,120
 to be fair, but on holiday. I think the deadline must have been a couple of weeks ago. Yeah. Yeah,

163
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,520
 because they moved it when they moved the dates, because that's a moveable fee spit.

164
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,840
 According to the constitution, bid documents for opposing bids must be filed no later than 180

165
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,080
 days beforehand. And no other bids have been filed to Seattle will be the only bid on the ballot.

166
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,240
 So so yeah, well done Seattle. I mean, so I like Seattle for two reasons. Firstly, crack in logo.

167
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,600
 And secondly, Seattle is a pretty great city. So yeah, I am if it is successful, which I

168
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,880
 should expect it will be, but touch would, then then I might go. So I like Seattle, haven't been

169
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,360
 for a while. I've never been Seattle. So I like that idea. Oh, it's lovely Liz. Oh, no, we,

170
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,600
 Stephen was like Seattle. So I think I think the chances will be at the 25 worldcon and not

171
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,680
 nil. It seems nice that it's gone to a bunch of big American cities. Maybe helps grow world

172
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:15,360
 kind of it. If you go to like DC and Chicago and Seattle. Yes. I mean, as well as, you know,

173
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,480
 London and Dublin and Helsinki and Chengdu and so on. You mean as opposed to like Reno and Spokane?

174
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,680
 Well, Spokane in particular. And I believe this is filed for Seattle. So and I understand, I don't

175
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,320
 want to say too much because I'm not like, I don't know these people hugely well, but I believe it

176
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,800
 is a completely different con running team that essentially Seattle has two bunches of smoths.

177
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,720
 And it's the, you know, Westcon people doing this one. And by and large, Spokane was not.

178
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,880
 Though, of course, Wilcons are huge. Lots of people work on them. Everyone works, you know,

179
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,520
 most people do some jobs on all of the world cons, but but in terms of who the board are.

180
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,440
 No, yeah, yeah, no, that's a good point. I just wondered whether Liz was being sarcastic, like,

181
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,360
 wonder whether Liz was being like, well, it's very good that American cities are having a turn

182
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,920
 because they're, you know, we need to grow the world, come by getting more Americans into the

183
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,400
 Phantom. I realized that's not quite what she was getting at, but I did. I was like, I just wondered

184
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,240
 if it was the most straight faced sarcasm Liz has ever delivered on the pod. No, it was sincere.

185
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,400
 Like, if it's only going to go to the US, you know, four years out of 10, which is what it has been

186
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,080
 for the past decade, then it's nice to have it in big cities where more people can reach them,

187
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,840
 basically. I don't know, maybe I'm underestimating the ability of Americans to drive there.

188
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,480
 And different big cities. I think it would be quite nice if it went to Los Angeles sometime

189
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:52,640
 quite soon. Or, yeah. I believe there is a Los Angeles bid in the near future. And I have not

190
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,760
 prepared to answer this question. But I believe that there is a bid for like, 2029 maybe?

191
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,760
 2026, according to Skiffy. That is that sooner than I thought, fair enough. I mean, because I think

192
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,200
 if you were going to pick three places to have world cons, you'd pick LA or San Jose, like, well,

193
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,560
 you'd pick LA or San Francisco, but sorry, San Jose fans in the absence of being able to do it in

194
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,640
 San Francisco, San Jose will do. Or you and then you'd pick Seattle and then you'd pick

195
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,160
 like Washington, North Chicago, right? Because they're like the corners and you wouldn't pick Orlando

196
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:37,360
 for reasons. I mean, many reasons, but it is, you know, humid swamp stars. That wasn't that

197
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,360
 wasn't the reason I was thinking of, but that is definitely a reason. And let's not go into.

198
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:49,920
 I believe it's an air conditioned humid swamp. Yes. Yes. That is true. I mean, yes, but if I say,

199
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,880
 you know, I got on a plane in Bangkok and got off it in Orlando and went, fuck me, this is warm and humid.

200
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:05,440
 That's definitely staying in the podcast, Liz. I mean, yes, obviously, no, no, I do not want

201
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,720
 to go to a convention in Florida, in under the current political situation in Florida, which is,

202
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,880
 you know, unsafe for many people who would like to go there. But also, I understand other people

203
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,400
 do not enjoy Disney World as much as me or human swamps. On the subject of conventions in North

204
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,840
 America, should we talk about Permicon? What did we have to say about Permicon? They've announced

205
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,960
 their virtual. Yeah. So Permicon, which is the 2023 North American starts fiction convention,

206
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,080
 which I have a sort of peculiar affinity for because their symbol is a moose. And as you know, I once

207
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,160
 ran an Easter con where our symbol was a moose. Now, as Permicon is in Winnipeg, a place that has

208
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,200
 quite a lot of moose. And as a population was in Docklands, which is a place that is not known for

209
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,800
 having moose at all, they probably have a slightly better claim to having a moose as their logo.

210
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:09,120
 But anyway, Permicon has announced its virtual rates, if you're in the UK, which is $90 Canadian,

211
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,880
 which sounds like a lot for a virtual convention until you realize that the Canadian dollar isn't

212
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,160
 really as much as you think it is. But it's a tick that comes out about 60 quid. And they're

213
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,000
 planning to have quite a lot of virtual programming. I was very excited by this because I saw their

214
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,120
 thing that said, if you voted in site selection, you will have a supporting membership. And of course,

215
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,560
 I voted in site selection, but I voted in World Conside selection. I did not vote in

216
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,600
 that's fixed selection. If you voted in that's fixed selection, you will have a supporting membership

217
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,760
 for the last week. And if you didn't, but you got drunk at Chacon and bought a $65 moose t-shirt

218
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,400
 by mistake, it turns out that also gives you a supporting membership, which you can then upgrade

219
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,920
 to virtual for, I think, $50 Canadian. And I'm thinking about doing that, even though, obviously,

220
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,400
 a lot of it happens in the middle of the night, UK time, because it's in Winnipeg, which six hours

221
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,080
 behind. And it's going to be a really good size of convention. They've got 725 attending so far. So,

222
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,600
 and I guess it's mid August. So I think it's going to be kind of like a really cool size for

223
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,680
 a national convention and way less big than World Cons. So as I like Eastern Consize

224
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,240
 conventions, it'll be a bit better than that. Yeah, no, that's awesome. I think that's good.

225
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:30,560
 On, yeah, another Worldcon note this week. Glasgow in 2024 now have the forms up to volunteer to be

226
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,400
 on programme or to suggest a programme item to happen. That does go into 2024. And they are

227
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,800
 separate forms. And to be on the programme, you will have to, I think, fill in that form, you have

228
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:48,160
 to create a login for the programme system planarama. So we'll link to the page that explains how you

229
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,920
 can do this. But that is the best way to suggesting you would like to see at Glasgow, like live

230
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:02,400
 podcasts hint hint. I think we should probably put in a bid for OctaThought Live. What do you think

231
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,840
 guys? Yes. Provided we don't have any ding dong arguments that caused us to stop doing the

232
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,600
 podcast before then. But you could always have a stunt, a stunt all three of us if necessary.

233
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,120
 Honestly, we could be on the programme or I could just be roaming the halls doing guerrilla podcasting

234
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,040
 inviting people to eat weird flavours of crisps. Or both.

235
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:29,280
 Do both, yes. No, that's good. I think I would like to do that. If there's anyone who particularly

236
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,680
 thinks it would be a bad idea, do write in. I think I think I probably am not supposed to say

237
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,400
 this as an official. I'm not supposed to say this as kind of an official pronouncement by Glasgow,

238
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,400
 but Esther did say she was hoping to have kind of a room that was going to be set up specifically

239
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,840
 with podcasts in mind that was kind of had all the tech that was that was needed to kind of split

240
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,120
 our streams for OctaThought and things like that. Because I think they're going to have a few.

241
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,240
 I don't think we'll be the only podcast wanting a split off to the work on programme.

242
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:06,880
 Yeah, there may be other superior podcasts that want us to like Hugo Girl. Yes. I mean,

243
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,200
 with my Glasgow programme admin helping out on, definitely don't give us a slot because we're

244
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,120
 awkward f*ckers. We are pain to wrangle. No, it's a lie. We'll be lovely.

245
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,680
 And also, if you do give us a slot, you better have a facility for people who've caught

246
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,800
 Covid over the course of the weekend at a pocket. Because you know what I'm like, guys.

247
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:43,360
 The clock award shortlist has been announced. Actually, the entire clock award long list was

248
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,600
 announced. And just when I'd finished looking at it and was thinking, oh, maybe I should try and

249
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,440
 predict what the shortlist is going to be, they announced shortlist. So that took the window at

250
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,720
 myself. It was quite a fast turnaround, wouldn't it? It was very fast. So I didn't get a chance to

251
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:08,560
 kind of pontificate too long. But yes, the shortlist is Venomous Lumpsucker by Ned Bowman,

252
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,720
 the red scholar's wake by Alliett DeBodard, Pluto Shine by Lucy Kissick, the anomaly by

253
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,800
 Herb Latellier, translated by Adrian Hunter, Coral Bones by E.J. Swift and Metronome by Tom Watson.

254
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:29,440
 Indeed. So it's the usual interesting list. I think they're all new nominees. It's got,

255
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,480
 you know, something's published as mainstream. It's got a translated novel on there. It's got

256
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:43,200
 something published by genre publishers. Sounds good, basically. Yes. In the show notes, Liz notes

257
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,040
 that she has read one of them. I have. Going to be the Alliett DeBodard. Correct. I have read

258
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:56,320
 the Alliett DeBodard. I have also read one of them. Is it the Coral Bones? No. Is it the Alliett

259
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,920
 DeBodard? No. Oh no, it's the anomaly. You said so on Discord this week. I did. The anomaly by

260
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:09,280
 Herb Latellier, translated by Adrian Hunter. So how did you find red scholars wake Liz? I liked it,

261
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,680
 but I'm not sure I would have put it on my list of the best of the year. Fair. I think it's got some

262
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,400
 really great stuff in there, but it does not really hang together as a novel for me. I mean,

263
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,920
 I don't know if we wish to discuss the clock shortlist in more detail, but I would say the

264
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:33,280
 Red Scholars Wake is essentially, it's a space opera about kind of space piracy, but also a lesbian

265
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,240
 romance novel between a human and a ship. And I think that's got some really interesting stuff,

266
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,640
 but it didn't quite work for me as a romance novel or as a science fiction novel. Well, I like

267
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,360
 bits of it. Yeah, kind of it didn't. It didn't go maybe fine off into either one, if that makes

268
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,320
 sense. I would say it's still worth reading, so I think it's something that's going to disappoint

269
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,760
 anyone who reads it on the Clark list. I'd give it three stars. Okay, fair enough. On the other hand,

270
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,240
 a lot of books I've read because they're on the Clark shortlist, and I would give them one star.

271
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:12,480
 So fewer than three stars. Dies Fair. Last year, I had at least one absolute shocker

272
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,320
 on it, so there was that. I enjoyed the anomaly. Didn't think it quite stuck the landing, but I did

273
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,800
 enjoy the conceit. So yeah, it was also a quite quick read. Was last year the one where one of

274
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,560
 the novels was a homage to a novel that you hadn't read that's very famous, but that you hadn't read,

275
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,960
 and so therefore you probably didn't get what the author was trying to do at all. That was,

276
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,200
 I don't think that was in the "pfft, where am I been?" Jamaica in, so Skywarden or something?

277
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,320
 Yeah. So I think there's an issue where you've got something that's trying to resonate with

278
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,760
 something that's quite famous, not everyone's going to have read that. Sometimes novels just

279
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,200
 of that kind just do not stand alone. I mean, I haven't read it, so I don't know if it's any good

280
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,520
 or not, but that might be the reason you didn't like it. I didn't like it because the only

281
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,160
 interesting SF-Nolbit was the final chapter, and that would have worked very well as a short story.

282
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,360
 I think the thing I'd be very interested in is the transcript of the judges' meetings for the

283
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,560
 Arthur C. Clark Award, because I'm sure they're phenomenally interesting. Yes, possibly.

284
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,840
 But I mean, I love the process, because what happens is that we end up with these very interesting

285
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:31,920
 shortlist. Oh, but it wasn't the worst book on the ballot last year. The worst book was bloody awful.

286
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,640
 No, so like last year's Clark list had two that I really detested, like really, really hated,

287
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,840
 and I am curious to know whether this year will be similar, but we will see.

288
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,120
 What's the other one you hate, John? A River Called Time by Caution Newland.

289
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:57,040
 I hated it more after I read the afterword. So this year, when they announced the shortlist,

290
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,720
 I did not immediately spread this news to my friends. I immediately went to my library's website,

291
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,280
 where I managed to download two of them straight away and have another three.

292
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,480
 I think one's downloaded as an actual thing, and then a second one that's coming to me by on paper,

293
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,920
 and then three of the rest are on my hold list. So I think there's only one that isn't in the

294
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,280
 London Library's consortium system. That's a lot better than normal, so I was quite excited by that.

295
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:30,720
 So hopefully I will have read them before the announcement this time. I think I am more likely

296
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,640
 to read the Clark Award shortlist this year. If it turns out that the Hugo novel shortlist

297
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,640
 is entirely an untranslated Chinese, a language which I cannot read or speak.

298
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,800
 Yes, I think that is fair. Entirely reasonable. So yeah, I will look forward to reading them,

299
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,240
 and etc.

300
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,800
 Alison, talk about your golf trip. Oh yeah, can I get which one about my

301
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,400
 golf trip? Right, I'm going to fly out, probably with Stephen as well, on the 26th of September,

302
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,920
 it looks like, and I'm going to go straight to Canberra, where I'm going to have a day to kind of

303
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:20,160
 collect my thoughts, because it's a very different time of the day, and then attend Conflux, which is

304
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:28,000
 the Australian NatCon, as well as being the sort of science fiction convention that says it's for

305
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,720
 writers, I think writers and artists, let me see what it says. Basically, it actually says it's not

306
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,440
 a convention for fans, it's too unusual, but there we go, it is also the Australian NatCon,

307
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,440
 so I think it's going to get some fans whether it wants them or not, at least one.

308
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,880
 So fans are coming, whether you want them or not. Fan anyway.

309
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,320
 I like that. It is, yeah, it's an odd attack.

310
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,200
 So I'm going to attend the National Convention, which is in Canberra, and then immediately after that,

311
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,000
 it looks like I'm going to go to Melbourne for about a week, and then go to Adelaide, and then

312
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,520
 have a couple of days in Sydney with Stephen not doing con things, just kind of celebrating our

313
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,160
 25th wedding anniversary, which will be nice. It's actually going to happen, the 25th wedding

314
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,800
 anniversary, after Stephen's flown back to the UK. But you know, what does the exact date that

315
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,160
 really? And then probably hang around with fans in Sydney, if there are any I can find, and then

316
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,320
 go to Perth, well, I'm going to New Zealand, and I might squeeze in a few days in Perth, or we

317
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,480
 might decide that it's all too much, and I'll just go to New Zealand and do quite a lot of different

318
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,080
 things in New Zealand. It depends how the flights work. But that's the plan. So if you are in any

319
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,840
 of those places, and you listen to the podcast, and you would like to put me up or put me in

320
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,360
 Stephen up, or take me to do exciting things in Australia, like I quite like to see a cricket game,

321
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,440
 for example, let me know. That'd be good. Thank you very much. Gonna be fun.

322
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,960
 A variety of guff related merchandise will be available soon. That is very exciting. I hope you

323
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,480
 have a great guff trip. I'm trying to think of ways we can invite the listeners to troll Alison on

324
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,520
 her guff trip, but nothing has sprung to mine yet. So you're okay. Oh, I was wondering if I should

325
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,160
 say to conflicts, do you want to do an episode of Dr Thought Life? No, I know you're going to have

326
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,480
 two stunt people. Do you not want to be a go-no because you won't be members? Okay, fine.

327
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,840
 How much is the virtual? Won't be member and will be in bed. Will you be in bed?

328
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,640
 Why am I not being bad? John probably will. I mean, she's currently a bed Alison, so it seems likely.

329
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:43,120
 Shall we do pics? Who would like to pick first? Do you want me to pick first? Yes.

330
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:52,400
 So I have had a little holiday, and while I was on holiday I did some reading. That's not like you.

331
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:59,200
 You're saying the piss about how much I go to the beach, John? No, I would never. I think I'd

332
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,000
 probably go to the beach a lot as well if I were living near to some of the world's best beaches,

333
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,400
 rather than living near to South End and also Clackton. Don't make me send you pictures of

334
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,640
 absolutely beautiful beaches that you're not at. Ah, send me lots of pictures of beautiful beaches.

335
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:23,920
 Love them. So while I was on holiday I caught up on, I think the latest two full novels in the

336
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,680
 Rivers of London series. So when I was on who hasn't read Rivers of London, it is Ben Aranovich's

337
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,680
 series of novels about Peter Grant, a Met Police officer who basically works in the branch of the

338
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,760
 Met that deals with all things weird and supernatural. It's quite a long-running series now. There's a

339
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,840
 bunch of novels, some novellas, some graphic novels that I haven't read at all. Yeah, and I kind of

340
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,160
 caught up with the latest two and remembered really why I enjoy reading these. So I actually found the

341
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:00,960
 seventh book in the series. The seventh novel kind of ties up or partly ties up some plot strands

342
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,040
 right back from the first book, and I found it a bit satisfying, so I sort of took a big break,

343
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,920
 and then the eighth and the ninth are more standalone mysteries, and they're just fun. They're just like

344
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:18,080
 well, well put together, well paced, interesting mystery novels. Peter Grant, the main character,

345
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:24,480
 is really fun to kind of watch him go from new Met Police officer to the person who is now

346
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,080
 starting to be the magical expert and mentoring his other colleagues at the stage. These books are

347
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:36,560
 apt. He's also about to become a father for the first time with his girlfriend who is also a river.

348
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,880
 Yeah, and I think the one weak point is I don't think they ever end quite as well as I would like

349
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,880
 them to. The mysteries kind of always get tied up a bit too quickly or leave a little bit too much

350
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,240
 hanging for future novels, but I just really enjoy kind of racing through these two and will

351
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,800
 probably pick up the next one whenever it's published. And if I had thought of this and read them earlier,

352
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,760
 they probably would have been a Hugo Best Series pick, but I didn't think about it in time.

353
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,320
 I thought it was one of the things that came up when we were talking about possible picks for

354
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,640
 Best Series in fact. Could have been. But I think I would say, I think next year when the

355
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:22,080
 Worldcon is in the United Kingdom might be a good time to try and encourage all the British fans to

356
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:28,640
 vote there or the good British series onto the Hugo ballot. Yes, and I think there is a qualifying

357
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,960
 novella this year to the qualifying volume. Benaranovich was one of the guests of honor at

358
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,760
 Reconnect in New Zealand where I was also the guest of honor and he was absolutely delightful.

359
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,000
 I listened to his interview and really enjoyed it. I thought it was very good.

360
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,280
 So I just want to check the two you read were false value and and lies sleeping. I assume Liz.

361
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,840
 No, the two I read were false value and amongst our weapons. Oh, okay. I don't think I've read

362
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,520
 amongst our weapons yet, but I have read false value. Yes, so I quite like false value. I think

363
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,080
 amongst our weapons is a slightly better one. It also goes back but it also goes back to the

364
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,920
 Leslie plot arc, which I thought was a bit not well tied up in lies sleeping but sometimes it's

365
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,240
 a Reddit. Okay, having actually like done some live fact checking here, River of London was

366
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,280
 nominated for best series in 2017, but it didn't win and has definitely had sufficient volumes to

367
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:38,560
 be eligible again since then. Good. I read most of the first one and then on paper and then put

368
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,160
 it down somewhere and never picked it up again, which I mean, I really, really, I was really enjoying

369
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,160
 it. It was like, so I don't know why I didn't. I will read them one day. I need to read more books,

370
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,880
 guys. Can we read them on a golf trip? They're good kind of books for plowing through when you

371
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,760
 might be a bit distracted in transit and so on. Yes, that is fair. It is not a slight

372
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,440
 against them just that they're generally told in a fairly linear way and they're pretty easy to

373
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,080
 read. They're exactly the sort of books that I think the Hugo Award for Best Series is a good

374
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:23,520
 thing. It means that it's a good thing because I think it is a difficult skill but it does reward

375
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,320
 like it means you can write these big long series and it you know you can have these massive stories

376
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,040
 and I think that is something that like I would never pick one of these books as like the best

377
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,240
 novel of the year by definitely think this series is like a rollicking good read and I would recommend

378
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,200
 it to someone who just wants like some lovely books with characters that do interesting things

379
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,920
 but aren't like, I don't know, I think there's merit to that. I'm not describing it very well.

380
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,320
 Yes, yes. And Mashe's genre is together in an interesting way and also comes from a... Yes.

381
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,880
 Comes from a place, you know, the characters in this book are not well represented in

382
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,560
 science fiction in general, right? No. Fantasy, I suppose more fantasy, well fantasy mystery than

383
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,880
 SF. But I do like the book, you know, I really did enjoy the one I nearly read.

384
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,840
 I mean it does feel like they're very much the books about a modern London.

385
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,440
 Yeah, that's also true. And we like that if we live in modern London.

386
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,760
 God John, have you just convinced me of like a good argument for where we have the best series,

387
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,320
 Hugo? God damn it John. Well this is the argument I've always

388
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,200
 had in my head about the best series. Hugo, I'm just not sure I've ever been very good at

389
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,240
 articulating it. Oh, you've definitely articulated on the podcast. Oh, yeah, you know,

390
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,440
 I'd say that. I mean, the problem with the best series Hugo, at least in part, is that that's not

391
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,160
 how people vote though. They vote for the series that contains their favourite novel of the year.

392
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,680
 Look, right, we can't be grumpy at Hugo categories because people voting them wrong because if we

393
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:02,800
 were, that would just be angry all the time. All the live long day. Very hard being me.

394
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,360
 On with the on with the picks because it's bedtime. Shall I go next on the basis that

395
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,360
 Alison's pick is even less SF Northern mine. Yeah, go on. I went to a convention listeners.

396
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,400
 I went to the UK Games Expo, which was held at the NEC at the start of June. So,

397
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,360
 Conventions been running now for 16 years. I think the first one was in 2006, 2007,

398
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:34,960
 2007, I think. And so I remember when it was in a Masonic Hall somewhere in Birmingham and it fit

399
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,680
 into a single room. And now it is the entire of the Birmingham NEC Hilton Metropolitan,

400
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:49,280
 plus three full halls of the NEC. It is truly bonkers now. But yes, I went and it was good.

401
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:58,720
 I had a lovely time and I played lots of board games, board games with people who love board games.

402
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:06,320
 So I played an interesting game called Earthborne Rangers, which is really interesting. One of the

403
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,840
 one of the key things about this game is that it's fully compostable, which is an odd selling point

404
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,440
 for a game. But it means that when you finally like you decided to order play it and slash or

405
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,840
 pop your clogs and your next kinder doesn't want to play it, it won't bugger up the earth when it

406
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:32,720
 goes. So that's nice. And it's a game set in a world that's a bit similar to Horizon. It's like

407
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:40,240
 a post-climate catastrophe world where humanity is kind of living more in balance with nature than

408
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,480
 at the moment. And it was quite kind of a nice contemplative little kind of questy card game.

409
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,200
 And it particularly tickled my fancy because it felt very much like a cross between

410
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,240
 Arkham Horror of the card game and Seventh Continent, the board game. And so yeah, I thought it was

411
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,040
 really interesting. Well, did I play? My friend bought a game called Solar Sphere, which is a game

412
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,960
 about building a Dyson Sphere that was nominated for or won an award. I can't remember which. But

413
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,920
 like that sounded like it would be quite fun. And I look forward to playing that. I played a game

414
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,960
 called Flick Fleet. Flick Fleet is a very good idea for a game that I would never ever buy. So the way

415
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,240
 it works is you get spaceships, which are bits of acrylic, and you put them on an earframe play

416
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,880
 map. And then you put asteroids on the near-prem play map. And in order to move your ships about,

417
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,840
 you have to flick them. Well, this is by the people who did asteroid dice. Possibly.

418
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,760
 So I played that at Dragon Meat and thought it was hilarious and also mad. But you know,

419
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,880
 I would never buy it. And I got them to tell me about their Kickstarter for Asteroid Dice,

420
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,320
 which has now launched. And Asteroid Dice is a game where you have large dice and you throw

421
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,440
 them at people. And I'm never going to buy that. But you know, people seem to like it. Large

422
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,000
 like foam dice. So if you want large foam dice, you can buy them on the internet now.

423
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:14,160
 Yes, yes, yes. I am confused because I know about Asteroid Dice, but that's not on the

424
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,320
 Flick Fleet website. So I don't know. No, their game is. Okay, so I did not play Flick Fleet.

425
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:27,920
 I played a game called Shape Invaders, where you have a bunch of acrylic space invaders and you flick

426
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,920
 them at people. That sounds like quite a similar game, doesn't it? Interesting.

427
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,960
 Turn any tabletop into a battleground with Shape Invaders. Aim Flick and eliminate the enemy.

428
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:46,000
 That has not yet been kick-started, but it's coming to Kickstarter, it says. So it looks

429
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,160
 less strategic. Yeah, no, it wasn't strategic at all. It was hilarious. Just, you know.

430
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,640
 So Flick Fleet is quite strategic. So Flick Fleet reminded me most of the X-Wing

431
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,160
 miniatures game. So you have like hit points and shields and like different systems that you can

432
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,560
 repair and etc. But it was just, it was a very good idea. I liked it quite a lot, but I was extremely

433
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,360
 bad at it. Yeah, so, so I don't really believe in it. That's like saying that Snuka or Pool or

434
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,320
 Games of that type are strategic because I know that they are, but they're not when I play them

435
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:29,600
 because I just tried not to foul. Yeah, no, that's fair. Yes. No, and that's like, I appreciate that

436
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:35,280
 Snuka is a very fine game and yes, I would never play it in the pub. And this is in exactly the

437
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,200
 same wheelhouse where it's like, Oh, and I would play it in the pub. I love playing these games in

438
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,920
 the pub. I'm just very bad at them. I like watching other people play them in the pub. Have either of

439
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:53,040
 you played a game called Catacombs, which was also a Kickstarter and sounds pretty similar?

440
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,440
 Ah, yes. Dextarity based dungeon delve. Yeah, it's like a dungeon game and everything is little

441
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:08,400
 wooden discs and you flick them around. Except for the Armadillo, which rolls and I always insist

442
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,760
 in getting the Armadillo where possible and you sort of roll it on its side and it goes somewhere

443
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,000
 completely unpredictable and it's fun. I have played a game called Dungeon Drop where you hunt for

444
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,640
 Treasurish kill monsters having dropped all the pieces onto your coffee table from or gaming table

445
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,080
 from a height of about 12 inches. This is a game that you really, really, really want to play on a

446
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,240
 tray, which we do because if you don't play it on a tray, then you have an additional game where

447
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,640
 you frightified all the little bits off the floor. Catacombs comes with like a side wall to go around

448
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,400
 the board. Nice. Sensible. And a Geelat in its cube. Dungeon Drop sells this as an extra,

449
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,600
 which is why we play it on a tray. I will attempt to link to all these things in the show notes,

450
00:44:53,600 --> 00:45:00,400
 but apologies if I miss one. Octa thought gaming corner. Yes. But no, it was really good and I bought

451
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,880
 some games, but none of them are SFNAL. That's a lie. One of them is SFNAL. I bought this

452
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,760
 for the listeners who cannot see my camera. I bought Final Girl. So Final Girl is a single player

453
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,440
 game which kind of spins off of the hostage negotiator series of games. And it's based on the

454
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,840
 Final Girl trope, which is basically a thing that you find a lot in horror movies where you have like

455
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,120
 a single woman at the end of the movie who is like the only one left alive and is trying to stay that

456
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:36,720
 way. Notable examples of the genre include Alien and Cabin in the Woods. I bought, they basically do a

457
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,760
 lot of off-brand boxes which are kind of horror movies that they don't have the rights to that are

458
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:48,000
 like just generic enough to get away with it. So I bought the set which is the Evamorph, which has a

459
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,480
 picture of a woman who looks very likes a guinea weaver on the cover. And that's quite fun. It's

460
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,240
 incredibly difficult. I have not won a game yet. But I enjoy it. And that's the main thing. Indeed.

461
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,480
 But yeah, it had a lovely time. It was really good. So my pick this week was going to be,

462
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,840
 well, I wanted to go last in the picks because I thought there was a fairly good chance

463
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:15,200
 that that would be either at the close of play or after England had got all out. But in fact,

464
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,160
 they haven't. So my pick is the cricket I am planning to spend much of the next six weeks listening

465
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,720
 to cricket, watching cricket, drinking beer and talking about cricket. Cricket, that's good.

466
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,360
 It's not very science fictional though, is it? But yeah, England are playing Australia

467
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,560
 and the men, it's the men's turn this week and then it's the women's turn next week. And I'm

468
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:40,720
 going with science fiction fans, so that's science fictional right, to watch the women play in Nottingham.

469
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,840
 So one of the great things about the rise, women's cricket is good. Women's sport generally is good.

470
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:54,000
 It's good that it's a lot more represented than it was even when I was like, you know, even 15 years

471
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,760
 ago, like it's come on in leaps and bounds, which is great. But it does also give rise to there is a

472
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,320
 podcast called the nobles podcast, which if you'd like cricket is quite good. And they have started

473
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:09,840
 a trend of referring to the men's ashes and the women's ashes as the mashes and the washes.

474
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:15,840
 And that makes me very happy. So the mashes are on at the moment and the washes are on soon.

475
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,000
 Yeah, starting next week. Yeah, so they've already sold more tickets for the women's

476
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,640
 cricket than they did in the whole of 2022. And that included the game that I went to last year,

477
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,920
 which was the largest gate for a women's cricket game ever in the United Kingdom.

478
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,400
 None of this was really on topic for the podcast. So I did have a plan for what I was going to do

479
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,520
 as my pick, but I've had a bit of a mad week that hasn't quite gone according to plan.

480
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,240
 So hopefully you'll get that next week, which is a perfectly sensible and realistic pick

481
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,440
 of actual books that relate to the topic and everything.

482
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:53,440
 I don't want to, I mean, I don't want to, I'm not going to check, but I suspect you've picked

483
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:01,200
 cricket before. It's possible, I pick cricket every summer. Starting with last summer,

484
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,160
 I'm still a new fan of cricket. There are two summers a year because of the joy of hemispheres.

485
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:14,160
 And that was the old thought podcast, and it's goodbye from me. It's goodbye from me.

486
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:35,440
 [Music]

487
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,440
 God, there's a lot of news this week. There is, isn't there? I'm never getting to bed.
