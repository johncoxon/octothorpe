1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Oh, I'm also going to say that I forgot to turn the air conditioning off.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 So the first half hour of this one has some air conditioning.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,600
 Sorry.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,000
 That'll be the cold open.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,400
 Da boom tish.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,800
 Sorry.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,200
 And the reason it will be the cold open is because Liz had the air conditioning on.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,000
 I got there.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,400
 Sorry Liz.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:36,800
 Hello everyone and welcome to the very 104th episode of Octohorpe.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,000
 This episode is coming to you on the 29th of February 2024.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,600
 I am John Coxon.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
 I am Alison Scott.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
 And I am Liz Batty.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,800
 Happy Leap Day, folks.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 Oh.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
 Oh.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
 So Liz, who are you proposing to today?

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 Huh?

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
 So Liz, who are you proposing to today?

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
 Looking blankly at me.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
 Yeah.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,280
 It's an old thing where Leap Day and April Falls Day are the two days where women can propose

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,000
 to men for marriage.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,800
 Oh, I see.

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,600
 And by some old thing.

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,800
 You mean something that has not really applied in my lifetime?

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,800
 I think it's a custom.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
 According to the patriarchy, Liz.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 Yeah, I'm definitely paying tons of attention to that then, aren't I?

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
 Right then.

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:33,080
 This episode listeners, we are going to talk about what we enjoyed from 2023 and what we

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:42,080
 might nominate for awards in 2024, including but not limited to the Hugo Award.

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,040
 So if you're wondering why we're all being completely silent on the amazing things that

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,200
 have happened in science fiction and science fiction fandom in the last two weeks,

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,680
 that's because they haven't happened yet.

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
 I think we should say a little bit about the fan categories.

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,320
 We probably won't say too much because I tend to think that people who know and love

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,480
 these categories also know some of the things they want to vote for.

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,440
 But I really wanted a chance to shout out Geri Sullivan's idea, which is a fantastic

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,520
 fanzine that had an issue with December 2023.

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,320
 It is eligible for the Hugo and is I think the fanzine I have enjoyed the most in the

43
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,880
 last 12 months.

44
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,160
 That's the only thing I had in fanzine and you sniped me, Alison.

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,000
 You bastard.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,840
 You asked me to introduce the category?

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,800
 That's what you get.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
 I did.

49
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,080
 This is what I get.

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,600
 I should never, I should never do it again.

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,520
 I don't know if Idea is on the internet yet.

52
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
 All of Idea is online.

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,440
 The recent type of issues are at e-fanzines and the previous ones are at fanac.

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,200
 I would like to say this is very good.

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,000
 It has a great article by one, Alison Scott.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,560
 And it also has Sandra's report from Pemmi-Con, which will give some context to why we were

57
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,280
 saying that the Montreal bid would need to have answers for some of the things that

58
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 happened there.

59
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,680
 If you are unfamiliar with what happened at Pemmi-Con.

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
 I advise you go and read Idea number 13.

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,360
 I am just briefly going to shout out in this category the Ancilliary Review of Books who

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,720
 publish a lot of book criticism.

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,840
 And the reason I'm going to shout them out is because I assumed they were a semiprozine.

64
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,560
 And in fact, they are unpaid and so they are a fanzine instead.

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,800
 So anyone thinking of nominating that, this is a category it should go in.

66
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 Ooh.

67
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 Hm.

68
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 Intriguing.

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:43,440
 So I would like to mention noted fan artist and noted wife.

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,360
 More noted for being a fan artist, I would say, España Sheriff.

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
 I will be enthusiastically nominating her for fan artist.

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
 And Alison won't tell you to nominate her, but I will.

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,800
 You should nominate Alison as well because she's great.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,680
 I will also say we would obviously nominate Hugo, Girl, but they have recused themselves.

75
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,160
 So we cannot.

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,300
 We had muted nominating Ersatz Culture for best fan writer, but I believe he has said

77
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,560
 somewhere that he would recuse if he was awarded it and he wants people to nominate Chinese

78
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
 fan writers.

79
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
 Yeah, it is.

80
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,760
 Ersatz Culture has said that he will recuse if you nominate him, but also that he's going

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,240
 to put up a list of Chinese fan writers who are worth looking at.

82
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,320
 So when that pops up, we'll mention it so you can go and take a look at those.

83
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:41,240
 I'm hoping quite a lot of reports from Chengdu will start trickling out and being translated.

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,520
 For fan writer, I'd quite like to see, I'm sure other people will think of this, but please

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,920
 nominate Paul Weimer.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,640
 This might be something that comes back up through my nominations.

87
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,400
 Yeah, please nominate Paul Weimer who was unjustly.

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
 I think we could agree.

89
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,640
 Left off the Hugo ballot in 2023.

90
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,200
 And I would also think about Camestros Felapton who has done a lot of great work.

91
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,920
 Yes, I would agree.

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,320
 I might nominate some of the Nerds of a Feather crew.

93
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,480
 My problem is that sometimes I read Nerds of a Feather and don't pay 100% attention

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 to who is writing which bits, but they have some great writers there.

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,640
 So we can just nominate Nerds of a Feather, yes?

96
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,960
 Well only in Fanzine not in Best Fan Writer, yeah, but I might go and have a look at the different

97
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
 bits.

98
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,080
 We're lumping all of the fan categories together at the moment.

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,640
 So Nerds of a Feather is a good fanzine rec.

100
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,280
 Paul Weimer is a contributor to Nerds of a Feather.

101
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,440
 As is friend of the pod, Haley Zapal, who is one of the Hugo Girl hosts.

102
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,640
 Another fan writer we should mention is Sandra Bond and she has been posting.

103
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,720
 She is just generally a very good fan writer.

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:03,440
 Her work from idea makes her eligible for a fan writer as well a vast corpus of other work.

105
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,240
 I will also say if she continues to write excellent poems about Dave McCarty in the Anonymous

106
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,280
 Claire Discord, then I shall be definitely nominating her next year as well.

107
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,720
 And I shall be hoping that they make their way into the voter packet.

108
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,120
 She writes excellent poems on a wide range of things all over the internet.

109
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,520
 So I think actually that's another reason why Sandra Bond might deserve your fan writer

110
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
 vote.

111
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,600
 I've got a Fancast.

112
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:33,120
 As I said last year, everyone should nominate Going Solo by Tansy Gardam, which is an incredibly

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,720
 deeply researched podcast that did a series on the Solo film, a series on Rogue One, and in

114
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,360
 2023, this is the end of the solo series plus a series on the writer's strike with a lot

115
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,920
 of historical stuff about the past strikes and how they affected things and also standalone

116
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,000
 episodes on The Creator and How to Train your Dragon and it's really good and it's really

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,040
 funny and it's really well written and yeah, you should really really nominate that one.

118
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,000
 You nominate one podcast, nominate Going Solo.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,800
 I believe it is still called Going Rogue.

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
 Oh sorry.

121
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,320
 That's quite like, well I think that, because I think that season, podcasts with seasons

122
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,920
 confuse me because like, why are they even?

123
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,960
 Oh god, it is called Going Rogue.

124
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
 Sorry.

125
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,720
 We’re an evergreen podcast.

126
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,360
 Alright, nominate Going Rogue by Tansy Gardam not Going Solo.

127
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,360
 I've got confused and it's also wrong on the Hugo spreadsheet.

128
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:36,800
 So please nominate Going Rogue.

129
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
 Game apparently.

130
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,800
 Yeah, something called Best Game or Interactive Work.

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,680
 A new category.

132
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,360
 So the two obvious ones in this category are two games I have not played which are Tears

133
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,920
 of the Kingdom and Baldur's Gate 3.

134
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,400
 I didn't like Breath of the Wild enough to want to play the sequel.

135
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,720
 Baldur's Gate 3 is on my list of things to play but I haven't got around to it yet.

136
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,480
 Do you want to do your actual suggestions then now?

137
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:12,680
 The thing I enjoyed very much from 2023 was a game called Star Wars Jedi Survivor which

138
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,960
 I think was amazing.

139
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,840
 It took everything I loved about the first game and then basically just made it all better

140
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,440
 which was great.

141
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,680
 Which was the first game, John?

142
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,640
 Jedi Fallen Order.

143
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,880
 I will be enthusiastically nominating Star Wars Jedi Survivor for a Hugo Award.

144
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,840
 I will also be nominating a couple of board games.

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,920
 I do not expect them to arrive on the ballot but equally I feel I would be remiss if I

146
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,880
 did not nominate them.

147
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
 First things first, I can't nominate Arkham Horror the Card Game on account of how it

148
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,520
 didn't have an expansion in 2023.

149
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,520
 It's very sad, will be enthusiastically.

150
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,080
 I will say that the 2022 expansion was an absolute masterpiece and everyone who doesn't like

151
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
 it was wrong.

152
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,360
 I will also be nominating Earthborne Rangers which I really like.

153
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,080
 I've only played a little bit of it but I think it's really good and it's basically

154
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
 if.

155
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,720
 It's the gameplay of Arkham Horror the Card Game with the setting of Horizon Zero Dawn

156
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,720
 in a way and so it is very up my alley.

157
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
 Oh that sounds good.

158
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
 It does doesn't it?

159
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,840
 A little bit of Seventh Continent dashed in.

160
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,760
 I've seen a lot of people saying lovely lovely things about this on the internet over the

161
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,720
 while I've been in a while I've been under a rock.

162
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,080
 The rock I've been under has had a lot of board games in it.

163
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,960
 The other games I will be nominating are Moon and Star Wars the Deck building game both

164
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,320
 of which I thought were great.

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,800
 I was skeptical that Star Wars the game would be great and then it turned out it was great

166
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
 so that was pleasantly surprising.

167
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,960
 But yes those are my picks in games.

168
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,080
 There is also a game on the giant spreadsheet of Doom that I have not played but really

169
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,680
 really really want to so I don't know if either of you have played it called Apairy where

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,560
 you play Space bees.

171
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,040
 Yes that has that has it is all my list of things to play but I have not yet played.

172
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,880
 I would very much like to play it.

173
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,160
 But I looked at that like oh yes that's a good choice.

174
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
 Despite the fact that I haven't played it.

175
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,040
 Just on the buzz of all the people who have.

176
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,560
 My favourite game from 2023 wasn't genre which is sad it's about economics and it has no

177
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,840
 SF2-led elements at all.

178
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
 Which games that?

179
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:36,920
 Hegemony which is basically a model of class systems and economics and is absolutely wonderful.

180
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,200
 It's just so good.

181
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,480
 Long time listeners will note that the weight on BGG that it has of 4.18 would not usually

182
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,960
 be in the Coxon range of acceptable weights for a board game and yet I love it.

183
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,560
 And the other one that's on there is Chants of Sennar which someone called Liz likes.

184
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,280
 I did please go back and listen to whatever episode I chose it as a pick.

185
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
 It's pretty good.

186
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:06,600
 I'll probably nominate it because I've literally played two eligible games this year I think.

187
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,280
 Because I only just got a Switch and I don't have a PlayStation 5 and I haven't played

188
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,160
 many board games so yeah.

189
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,520
 It's probably Chants of Sennar, possibly Dredge which is this sort of atmospheric fishing

190
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
 game.

191
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,640
 Yeah otherwise that is about it.

192
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,760
 I'd like to play Baldur's Gate 3 but I haven't you know forked out the cash for PlayStation

193
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
 5 yet.

194
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,080
 Which means I also can't nominate Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores which is on there but

195
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
 I haven't played that.

196
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,160
 I haven't played that either.

197
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,960
 I own it but I haven't played it.

198
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,960
 Baldur's Gate 3 is available on the Mac but not the PS4.

199
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,680
 This seems very ludicrous to me.

200
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,880
 Will also say another thing that's eligible in this category is the Galactic Star Cruiser.

201
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,560
 I didn't go on the Galactic Star Cruiser but I just think we should note that, because it

202
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,080
 was very ambitious and I've read so many articles about it and I'm just like oh I would

203
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,240
 have given a kidney well I wouldn't have given a kidney.

204
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,440
 I could have given a kidney and I didn't so clearly I wouldn't have done.

205
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,760
 What was Galactic Star Cruiser?

206
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,400
 Three day long LARP.

207
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,040
 It was an interactive yeah Star Wars Hotel/LARP.

208
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,520
 Yeah but so this is basically saying it's a convention right?

209
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
 It's a convention.

210
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
 No it's not.

211
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,840
 It's like Phantom Peak.

212
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,320
 No it's a larp.

213
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,160
 There's a story line and you can affect it and change it and your decisions have meaning.

214
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,360
 I think it falls under interactive work.

215
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,480
 100% in the same way that I think if you went to Phantom Peak that would be eligible

216
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,840
 for this category because it's a repeatable thing where it resets every time people enter

217
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
 it.

218
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,280
 Unlike a convention where a convention is unique and you can never go back.

219
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,760
 Did they run it multiple times?

220
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
 Is it like a...

221
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
 Yeah.

222
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
 Oh yeah so it's like a thing...

223
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:01,280
 It was basically a three day long escape room.

224
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,880
 And then we go on to the category of Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form.

225
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
 Ooh.

226
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,800
 Alison you watch TV.

227
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 I do.

228
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,960
 Have I watched any of this TV?

229
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,720
 Have I done any thinking about this?

230
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,640
 I am bewilderingly behind on my 2023 television.

231
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:29,480
 I will say that Strange New Worlds has a number of episodes on and I think I basically could

232
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,800
 nominate any Strange New Worlds.

233
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,920
 I think it'll be great.

234
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,080
 But the ones that are on the Hugo spreadsheet of doom are Ad Astra Per Aspera, Under the

235
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,600
 Cloak of War, Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow.

236
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,120
 Those Old Scientists and Subspace Rhapsody.

237
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,480
 I think of those I would nominate Those Old Scientists because I thought it was absolutely

238
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,480
 wonderful and it would be a very worthy winner.

239
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,600
 Ditto In a Fight/ Old Friends New Planets from Lower Decks.

240
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,080
 I think would also be very very good.

241
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,040
 And there is an episode of the Mandalorian on there which was episode 20...

242
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,120
 Sorry episode 7 of season 3 which is The Spies which I did also quite enjoy.

243
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,360
 I really want to nominate For All Mankind but I feel like I want to nominate it in long

244
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,020
 form rather than short form but I think it might be a bit difficult to nominate in long

245
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,040
 form because of the way in which the seasons overlap the year and I'll need to do a bit

246
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,360
 of finding out what everybody is doing.

247
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,680
 The episode that is mentioned on the giant spreadsheet of doom is Leningrad so I guess

248
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,000
 I probably will put it in a nomination in short form as well.

249
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,960
 The thing that people are mentioning here that I have not watched and feel most guilty

250
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,360
 about is another Apple TV show called Silo which I think is probably very good but I have

251
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,480
 not got around to watching yet.

252
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,040
 Have heard very good things.

253
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,880
 I'm still... I'm nearly all the way through season 3 of the Expanse guys.

254
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,080
 We are halfway through season 3 of For All Mankind and it is very good.

255
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,400
 I will say that the previous times For All Mankind has appeared on the ballot it has been

256
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,080
 nominated in short form for a specific episode so I would imagine that would continue but

257
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,680
 I do not know for sure.

258
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,200
 But none of these episodes make any sense whatsoever unless you are familiar with the

259
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,720
 overarching story arc so you know.

260
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,040
 Both The Giggle and The Church on Ruby Road are on the Hugo spreadsheet of doom.

261
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,800
 I have enjoyed... I did enjoy the run of Doctor Who specials recently but I am not sure I

262
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,760
 was planning to nominate any of them.

263
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,400
 I'm sure they will be on the ballot but I'm not just really sure I think they deserve

264
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,040
 Hugo awards.

265
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,680
 Maybe that is very controversial.

266
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,200
 Maybe that is a hot take.

267
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,880
 I would also say I'm not nominating For All Mankind because I think its fourth season

268
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,880
 was not very good, so no nominations for you.

269
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,280
 Also on the... you know people have been talking about Blue Eyed Samurai which I have started

270
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,280
 watching but not finished so I can't tell you which episode is best yet but that from

271
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,840
 the first three episodes is pretty great.

272
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:14,280
 I enjoyed Foundation a lot more in season 2 than season 1.

273
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,840
 I don't know what episode again to nominate but probably not the season finale which people

274
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,280
 put on there because I thought that was a bit weak.

275
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,600
 It will be one of the later episodes leading up to us.

276
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,280
 I'm going to put Strange New Worlds on but I like Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow which

277
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,600
 is the time travel one with Kirk.

278
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,360
 Full disclosure Liz, I'm probably just going to nominate five episodes of Strange New Worlds.

279
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,600
 No sorry, four of Strange New Worlds and one of Lower Decks.

280
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,080
 I genuinely think Strange New Worlds is one of the best things in science fiction television

281
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 at the moment.

282
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,640
 I just I would love to see it win a Hugo award.

283
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,600
 Most of the other things we're discussing I'm like I think it would be fine if it won

284
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,840
 a Hugo award but it wouldn't excite me.

285
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,520
 John, you need to catch up with For All Mankind so that Liz and I can have a big argument.

286
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,360
 I mean if I had to pick For All Mankind or Strange New Worlds, it's Strange New Worlds.

287
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
 Oh should I be watching Strange New Worlds?

288
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,800
 Were you not just I just said that Alison, like just now.

289
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,560
 It's it's sort of TV service I don't have is that the reason I'm not watching it?

290
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,200
 Yeah it's on Paramount+.

291
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,440
 Oh god.

292
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,840
 So I need another TV service.

293
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,880
 Yeah but just get it for a month watch all of Strange New Worlds and then cancel.

294
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,800
 Okay that's what we'll do but we have to finish the, do we have to finish The Expanse

295
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
 first?

296
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,200
 You can finish The Expanse whenever you like.

297
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,520
 Strange New Worlds doesn't rely on any story from the expansion.

298
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,720
 It won't spoil you.

299
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,680
 Yeah but we normally only watch one television TV show at the time right?

300
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,480
 Wait wait wait you've been watching For All Mankind and the Expanse or at least you took

301
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
 a pause.

302
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,400
 Yeah no so we watched bits of the Expanse and then we then we watched For All Mankind

303
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,360
 and then we went back to the Expanse as a bit of a For All Mankind methodone.

304
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,920
 Because I mean For All Mankind demonstrates what it is I want in my science fiction that

305
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,040
 the Expanse doesn't have but nevertheless the Expanse you know I've kind of got the

306
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
 hang of it now.

307
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:08,040
 I would also say that I have not watched Gen V which is The Boys spin off so I don't

308
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,240
 know if it was any good but in general I am still bewildered that the Hugo electorate are not

309
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,280
 nominating The Boys which I think is like one of the most savage criticisms of modern

310
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 day.

311
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,400
 For those who don't know the boys was developed by Eric Kripke who was also the showrunner

312
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,680
 on Supernatural and Supernatural is sort of a love letter to America in the same way

313
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,960
 that The Boys is a savage tearing apart of America.

314
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,880
 Like Supernatural is a celebration of everything that's good about it and The Boys is a quite

315
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,840
 cutting critique of everything that's bad about it and I think The Boys is great and

316
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,680
 I will be paying attention to the 2024 season with great interest because the previous three

317
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,520
 seasons were amazing.

318
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,920
 And once again where can I watch it?

319
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,520
 Amazon which you have if you're watching The Expanse so oh yes it is.

320
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,480
 I have I have I have you know I have the Amazon if I Amazon if I want to get print and

321
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
 play components delivered to my house twice a week.

322
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,680
 Obviously The Last of Us was eligible and I don't ever put the whole series in long

323
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,040
 form or just put the episode in short form that made me cry a lot which was Long Long

324
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,600
 Time which is basically a standalone so there you go.

325
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,840
 Poker Face which I should watch and I have not watched.

326
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,720
 Oh it's great I might try and put some of that in short form.

327
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,080
 In Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form listener Raj recommends The Wonderful Story

328
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,360
 of Henry Sugar and The Church on Ruby Road from Doctor Who.

329
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,040
 Thank you very much listener Raj.

330
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,280
 I would also like to shout out whoever has put on the spreadsheet.

331
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,680
 Superconductor PB 10XC UX showing levitation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure

332
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,800
 and mechanism which is quite a funny science burn.

333
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,600
 What, oh because it’s science fiction.

334
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,240
 Yeah because it's not actually superconductor.

335
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:02,320
 But shout out to whoever put that on the list. I'm not nominating it but well done.

336
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,040
 I think I am the person who has done the most Long Form so I might introduce Long Form go

337
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,320
 through the ones I've seen and the ones I think might be worth seeing before it all

338
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
 wraps up.

339
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,360
 Good oh yeah fair enough.

340
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 Agreed.

341
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,360
 Asteroid City

342
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,360
 Wes Anderson movie

343
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,800
 Absolutely phenomenal.

344
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,240
 I am not.

345
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,320
 It does have an alien in it.

346
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,040
 I was about to say I wasn't sure if it was genre but it does have aliens in it so I guess

347
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
 it probably is really.

348
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,720
 It's very close to the world but also if you have things like Oppenheimer and Hidden Figures

349
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,960
 and sh*t like that you definitely get Asteroid City, it's more science fiction than Oppenheimer

350
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
 obviously.

351
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,640
 And it is also a masterpiece so I will be enthusiastically nominating that.

352
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,040
 Barbie was very very good.

353
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,320
 It's technically genre.

354
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,720
 I'm not sure I think it's primarily good for its genre elements so I might nominate it

355
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,640
 but equally if there is a lot of other very SF-nal stuff on my ballot I might not which

356
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,320
 is not to say I didn't love it.

357
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,680
 The Creator was very pretty but was also awful so it will not be going on my ballot.

358
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,080
 D&D movie was great.

359
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 Not sure it deserves, I'm not sure it needs a Hugo it made more money than God I think

360
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,560
 but it was very fun.

361
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,040
 It's probably going on my ballot because I don't see a lot of movies and I really enjoyed

362
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
 that one.

363
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,240
 That is fair I mean it is very good it's basically it feels like a movie that's in conversation

364
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,560
 with the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie in terms of like its whole vibe.

365
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,760
 In that way I really enjoyed it and also Chris Pine is just brilliant in everything he does.

366
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,080
 Even things that are not good.

367
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,400
 Chris Pine is good in them.

368
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,840
 I feel like one of the things about the Dungeons and Dragons movie is that it had a lot there

369
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,120
 for people who had played a lot of Dungeons and Dragons in about 1980 and it had a lot

370
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,680
 there for people who played Dungeons and Dragons in 2023 and it had quite a lot there for people

371
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,080
 who had never played Dungeons and Dragons.

372
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,160
 And I think that's quite a good trick to pull off in a tie-in movie.

373
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,680
 Yes it also had a female lead with armpit hair.

374
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,120
 Tons of armpit hair and sensible armour.

375
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,200
 That was good.

376
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,440
 And also Hugh Grant hamming it up beyond hamness.

377
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,200
 Hugh Grant is living his best life and I am here for it.

378
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,040
 He really is.

379
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,680
 Guardians of the Galaxy Volume III which did make me cry will be going on my ballot.

380
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,200
 The Marvels I loved the Marvels some people didn't like the Marvels but those people

381
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,720
 I politely disagree with.

382
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,000
 That might go on my ballot.

383
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,160
 And then there's Polite Society which is the British Indian genre movie which was absolutely

384
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
 phenomenal.

385
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,320
 I am slightly surprised that I was the one to put it on the spreadsheet of Doom.

386
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,360
 I would very very much like to see this movie on the ballot.

387
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
 No chance.

388
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,360
 Oh I know there's no chance but that's why I'm trying to use my platform Alison.

389
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,080
 I would very much like our listeners to go and watch it and nominate it.

390
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
 Look it up.

391
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,640
 It's really really really really good.

392
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,160
 And then Poor Things which I think it would be astounding if it wasn't on the ballot which

393
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,080
 was also really really really good.

394
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,480
 I feel like poor things should have a following wind for a Glasgow Worldcon it really should

395
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,640
 despite the fact that it didn’t end up being set in Glasgow.

396
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,920
 And then Spider-Verse 2.

397
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,000
 Spider-Man across the Spider-Verse which will definitely be on my ballot.

398
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Yeah.

399
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,640
 It was a masterpiece even more than the first one was a masterpiece and the first one was

400
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
 a masterpiece.

401
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,920
 The only problem with it is the ending but I don't think that mars it enough for me

402
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,680
 not to want to nominate it.

403
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,680
 Has anyone mentioned Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?

404
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,520
 Indiana Jones and the dial of destiny is not on the Hugo spreadsheet of Doom which probably

405
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,080
 tells you a lot about his chances of getting on the ballot.

406
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,720
 It is a major genre movie of 2023 which I watched on an aeroplane.

407
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,080
 It's terrible, it's a terrible film.

408
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,240
 I really quite enjoyed it but it is terrible.

409
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,040
 In Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form, listener Raj wrote in to recommend the D&D

410
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,880
 movie and Across the Spider-Verse as we've mentioned but also recommended Nimona which

411
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 I don't think I know what it is and season 5 of Ghosts which we have mentioned before

412
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,360
 but we have not mentioned just now.

413
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,440
 So yes also one's to consider.

414
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,160
 Oh Nimona is the Netflix film based on the webcomic and graphic novel.

415
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,480
 Ooh that has passed me by, thank you very much for writing in Raj that's good.

416
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:30,040
 Alright shall we do Best Related Work?

417
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,440
 So there are multiple things for best related work.

418
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,040
 Some people have been mentioning All These Worlds, reviews and essays by Neil Harrison.

419
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,880
 I wanted to do that!

420
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,160
 Please nominate All These Worlds reviews and essays by Neil Harrison.

421
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,720
 It is fantastic, I still haven't finished it but the essays that I've read which has

422
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,680
 got a few of them now are all great and it is jolly good and thought  provoking.

423
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,400
 And we are totally biased guys, 100% biased podcast on this matter.

424
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,960
 The other book that I will be nominating is A City of Mars which I thought was extremely

425
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,040
 good and really enjoyed.

426
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,480
 Oh that is getting a lot of buzz.

427
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,160
 Yes it is.

428
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:14,640
 I think I've seen people mention that the best fan writer/best fanzine packet that was

429
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,720
 done unofficially before Chengdu released it is eligible but I would much rather recognise

430
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,680
 the people who did that in Best Fan Writer.

431
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,280
 Oh you mean, does he mean that that stuff from... hmm that's tricky because surely that

432
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,120
 fan packet is a re-publication of stuff that was from 2022?

433
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,480
 Yeah that's the thing, I think it's primarily notable for the fan effort rather than the

434
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,720
 contents and therefore I would rather reward the people for their effort than the contents.

435
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,720
 I don't know who wins the Hugo if all of the fanzines win a Hugo… I don't love it.

436
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,920
 Excellent, how about this?

437
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,320
 A Traveller in Time: the critical practice of Maureen KIncaid Speller edited by Nina

438
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
 Allen.

439
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,600
 That seems to be to be like an excellent, absolutely the sort of thing I would like to

440
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,920
 see on the Hugo ballot for Best Related Work.

441
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,240
 Yes I would agree.

442
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:13,160
 It's a shame that there are two really good collections of criticism from UK critics who

443
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,320
 knew and worked with each other coming out in the same year.

444
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,200
 Let's get them both on the ballot and then  they can fight it out for first and second place.

445
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,280
 That sounds good to me.

446
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,560
 Another fantastic book about genre that came out in 2023 was the book 50 Years of Text

447
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,720
 Games by Aaron Reed.

448
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,040
 It started as a substack but that it was much revised and produced for the book and

449
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:42,240
 the book is amazing and it is a really... I absolutely love it when really thoughtful,

450
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,800
 comprehensive books about gaming history come out because there are not that many of them

451
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,920
 yet because it is still quite a young genre in that sense and this is a wonderful book

452
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,800
 and nearly all of these individual... nearly all of the individual games are genre but not

453
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,720
 all by any means but overall it's clearly relevant to best related work and I would like to see

454
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,920
 that on the ballot even though I know it's only me.

455
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,360
 So if you have any interest at all in the history of text games, this is a book you should read.

456
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,600
 I'm about to put it on the...

457
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,400
 And that, I mean one of the articles from that went viral right?

458
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
 Which one was that?

459
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
 Oh I'm just finding it.

460
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,520
 It was the one about the...

461
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,320
 Female commune?

462
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
 Nuns?

463
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
 Yeah.

464
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,080
 Nuns making text games, something like that.

465
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,720
 I can't remember if they’re Nuns.

466
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
 Yeah.

467
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
 Women?

468
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
 Women in some sort of context.

469
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,240
 Yeah, I forget.

470
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,000
 We'll put a link in the show notes listeners.

471
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Yes, I found it.

472
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,920
 It was the one about St. Bride's School which turns out to be...

473
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,560
 Yeah, like a school which was putting out text adventures but I remember to go viral

474
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,800
 and lots of people presumably read that and then became aware of the 50 years of text adventures.

475
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
 Yeah, it ended up going to call 50 years of...

476
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,680
 It started out as 50 years of Text Adventures but the book is 50 years of Text Games because

477
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,840
 obviously the games included ended up being very much broader than just text adventures.

478
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,560
 I've also heard good stuff and this is going to link a bit of foreshadowing here.

479
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,720
 I've heard good stuff about "I Am the Law: How Judge Dredd predicted our future” by Michael

480
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,040
 Mulcher so I may try and get out to that before the nomination deadline as well.

481
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,760
 And that dovetails very nicely into Best Graphic Story.

482
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,320
 I will be nominating a thing.

483
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,640
 The thing I will be nominating is Moon Knight Volume 9 by Jed MacKaye and Alessandro Capuccio

484
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,720
 and Rochelle Rosenberg.

485
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
 It's really good.

486
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,080
 I've never seen...

487
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,160
 I've recommended Moon Knight on the podcast before and I love Moon Knight as a character

488
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,040
 but I do not think all the Moon Knight comics are good.

489
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,120
 I think that is important to say.

490
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,440
 This Moon Knight comic is great.

491
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,480
 It is weird.

492
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,640
 The art is superb.

493
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,280
 I cannot overstate how good the art is.

494
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,040
 Sometimes I just look at pages for like five minutes and be like this dope.

495
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:04,600
 The way in which it discusses the character is really nice and the way in which it embraces

496
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,200
 some of the weirder aspects of the Marvel Universe including one comic where he fights

497
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,400
 a house.

498
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,640
 Which is the sort of thing I love in comics because you can't do that elsewhere.

499
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,960
 It's got vampires in it.

500
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,640
 It's just all of the weird bits of Marvel and it's great.

501
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,120
 And it wrapped up in 2023 in December.

502
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,000
 I don't think I've actually got to that issue yet but I've read the preceding 27 issues

503
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,200
 and they were all issues I thoroughly enjoyed.

504
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,560
 So yes, I will be nominating that.

505
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,720
 I suspect it will not be on the ballot but I will nominate it.

506
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,920
 Presumably the way to get hold of that one is to take Marvel Unlimited for a month and

507
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
 read it all.

508
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
 Yes.

509
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,400
 Is there still a delay between stuff popping up on Marvel unlimited.

510
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,800
 There's six months normally so you might not get all of it that way.

511
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:58,600
 By the time you've read issues one to 27, issues 28 to 30 will probably have popped up.

512
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,640
 I would say but I might be wrong.

513
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,960
 I believe you can also just buy it.

514
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,920
 I will put links in the show notes to where the collections are available.

515
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,280
 Alison, you were going to recommend some comics as well.

516
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,640
 I was going to say one more time.

517
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,000
 Why Don't You Love Me? by Paul B. Rainey but I think we have mentioned that multiple

518
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,360
 times on the podcast now.

519
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
 I have read it.

520
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
 Did you like it?

521
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,480
 Ah, it's very bleak.

522
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,240
 I think I liked it but Jesus Christ it was bleak.

523
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
 It's very bleak.

524
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,440
 It is pretty bleak.

525
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,200
 And people talk about the ending being optimistic and I feel like they've read a different graphic

526
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
 novel to the one I read.

527
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,400
 I'm just going to say it's got one of the bleakest endings I've ever read I think.

528
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,720
 I feel like they did not understand the ending.

529
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,360
 Yeah, like maybe it's tricky right because they don't want to cast aspersions on people

530
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,480
 who interpret art differently to me.

531
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,840
 But I did not feel uplifted by the last page put it that way.

532
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,120
 But you know, it is clearly very good.

533
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:05,120
 But also there's a lot of stuff in graphic story that comes around is quite, I don't

534
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,520
 have to explain it.

535
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
 Sh*t.

536
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,680
 I don't mean sh*t but I mean kind of quite basic entertainment.

537
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,600
 You know, when I was saying how much I liked the Dungeons and Dragons movie, I mean I liked

538
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,120
 it because it made me laugh quite a lot for a couple of hours.

539
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
 Yeah.

540
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,720
 But I feel like when I read graphic stories, including some quite well thought off ones,

541
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,960
 quite a lot of them don't really do a lot more with the form than that.

542
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,000
 They entertain me for a while and then I'm done with it.

543
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,960
 And I would like to see graphic stories that have the use to have the same sort of weight

544
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,160
 and texture as novels do and all too often I don't see that.

545
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,400
 So when one comes along that does do that, I want to celebrate it.

546
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
 Is that fair?

547
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,600
 Yeah, I think that's fair.

548
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,120
 It's not like many other things I have read.

549
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,040
 So from that perspective. I would like to see a bigger range of genre graphic novels,

550
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
 please.

551
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,840
 What I will say, and this is tricky because it feels like I'm criticizing it for something

552
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,000
 it wasn't true.

553
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,320
 One of my core criticisms of it is that it didn't do what I wanted it to do.

554
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,960
 But I don't know if it wanted to do it and I am historically a bit hesitant to levy that

555
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
 kind of thing.

556
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,120
 I wish it had been bleaker and funnier.

557
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:24,240
 I think I would have really liked it if it was a if it had hewed more to the style of

558
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,400
 old school newspaper strip where it was like Bam Bam punchline.

559
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:36,520
 And I did I just I think I would have liked it more if it had been more parodic, parodic.

560
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,680
 But equally I don't think that's what it's trying to do.

561
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,960
 So I'm not sure if that's like a helpful thing to say.

562
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,320
 I think it hit its intended tone bang on over and over again.

563
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,280
 So I think I have to I have to say you are criticising it for something the author

564
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,480
 wasn't trying to do.

565
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
 Yeah, I think that is right.

566
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,840
 Probably.

567
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:10,080
 Best series I will be enthusiastically nominating The City of Last Chances slash House of Open

568
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,520
 Wounds series for Best Series.

569
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,640
 Ah, is it 240,000 words already?

570
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,840
 Probably they're quite big.

571
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
 It must be.

572
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
 Yeah.

573
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,440
 See my problem with that John is that I will be enthusiastically nominating The Final Architecture

574
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,800
 by one Adrian Tchaikovsky and therefore we are arguing.

575
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,920
 Has Adrian Tchaikovsky written enough extra words in five series for us to nominate a

576
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
 lot of them?

577
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,600
 I mean any other author you'd be like surely not, but Adrian Tchaikovsky perhaps.

578
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,400
 I'm thinking about it.

579
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
 Yeah.

580
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,880
 Yeah, we can nominate The Final Architecture series, which is the one Liz just mentioned.

581
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,400
 We can nominate the Tyrant Philosophers, which is what the series with city of last

582
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,520
 chances and house of open wounds is.

583
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,680
 I don't know what else he's written in 2023.

584
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,800
 This is just our equivalent to the sort of people who nominate five Star Trek episodes

585
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
 in 1967, isn't it?

586
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:11,120
 Star Trek in 1967 was a groundbreaking and great as Adrian Tchaikovsky is in 2024 and

587
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,360
 I will be fighting anyone who disagrees.

588
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:19,160
 I mean, I would say for bonus entertainment, I'm pretty sure both of the tyrant philosophers

589
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:25,200
 books are eligible in best novel due to it only getting a 2023 release in the US for

590
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
 the first book.

591
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,520
 So you have a chance to do something very funny.

592
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:39,200
 And looking it up on Kobo, House of Open Wounds is 186,000 words long.

593
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,160
 And so as long as City of Last Chances were more than 60k, which I think it was, then

594
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,640
 I think it's eligible.

595
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,960
 I mean, I think it is worth noting that because Ann Leckie wrote a fourth Imperial

596
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,720
 Raj book Translation State, it is possible to nominate the whole thing for series again.

597
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,360
 I'm not sure I will because I did particularly like the fourth book and I feel like the

598
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,080
 first few got enough individual awards, but it is eligible.

599
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,240
 So I think listener Raj wrote in and we'll get onto this in novel.

600
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:16,000
 So a few people wrote in with their favorite thing from 2023 and I solicited some opinions

601
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
 as well listeners.

602
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,800
 But I think Raj mentioned Translation State as one of the favorite five things from 2023.

603
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,440
 So I don't think Ann Leckie has ever been nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Series because

604
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,520
 it post-dates her most well known series.

605
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,760
 What else is a eligible, a bunch of stuff I haven't read.

606
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
 Cool.

607
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
 Dune!

608
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,960
 You can nominate Dune for Best Series listeners because they've written another one for some

609
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
 reason.

610
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
 What?

611
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
 Why?

612
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,480
 Oh there's tons of them.

613
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,520
 If this is true, this has a very good chance of winning because allegedly the Culture series

614
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,720
 is eligible because there is a work of drawings from the Culture which eligibleises it.

615
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,760
 And if that's true then a British Worldcon giving Iain M Banks a Hugo Award for Best

616
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
 Series is not.

617
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,760
 It's not unlikely but I don't know whether that counts and I had not heard that.

618
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,760
 I feel that is against the spirit of the award in a big way.

619
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,960
 Yeah I'm not sure I will be nominating it.

620
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,080
 You know it's not like, like Elric was properly eligible last year because Moorcock had written

621
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,440
 a new Elric book.

622
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,480
 Spoiler is written another one, it's eligible this year.

623
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,840
 Goodo, let's get Elric a Hugo, that would be good.

624
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,040
 Yeah but it's going to be really difficult because I won't nominate The Culture but

625
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,160
 if The Culture is on the ballot it was a very good series.

626
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,680
 I don't know what I'd do then, that's tricky, we'll have an argument if it happens.

627
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,480
 It's going to be a really tricky one there isn't it?

628
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,440
 Because someone's going to have to make an eligibility call.

629
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,160
 Yeah that would be down to Hugo UberChef.

630
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,280
 The Hugo, Heston Blumenthal, Nicholas Whyte?

631
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,240
 Yeah Hugo, Heston Blumenthall

632
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:04,560
 Nicholas Whyte.

633
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,360
 Shall we move on to short fiction?

634
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,320
 Yes it's just going to be me.

635
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:23,160
 I don't actually, I just, I find that short fiction has quite a low hit rate for me so

636
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,760
 I did read a bunch of stuff which was either off the Locus recommended reading list or

637
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,640
 things I had collected over time from recommendations on Bluesky or whatever or you know things

638
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,000
 there's also Rocket Stack Rank that does ranking of stories and things and I read a

639
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,840
 few of their top ranked ones and I didn't like that many of them.

640
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,240
 So yeah I've got a few suggestions but not as many that kind of really made me go oh

641
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,080
 this is amazing so I'm hoping that the Hugos, the nominations will draw some more stuff

642
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,240
 up especially in Novelette I've got nothing in Novelette yet.

643
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,480
 For listeners who are listening to the edit the reason Liz now sounds fed up is because

644
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,600
 I just made that terrible air conditioning joke from the start of the show here.

645
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,160
 I was on a roll and John is making terrible air conditioning jokes.

646
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,600
 Serious science fictional content coming up.

647
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,000
 I'm going to nominate some short fiction for the Hugos.

648
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,920
 So in Best Short Fiction I have a suggestion which is a piece called Spring Woods Spring

649
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:27,080
 by B. Pladek which was published at Strange Horizons and the premise basically is that

650
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,880
 the trees have started glowing and it's a kind of nice meditation on climate change,

651
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:42,080
 on aging, on families, on like the end of civilization in a way and I just really enjoyed

652
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,280
 the tone so I'm going to suggest that one.

653
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
 That's cool.

654
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,640
 Yeah that's not on the giant spreadsheet of doom.

655
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,320
 Oh well I should put it on the giant spreadsheet of doom.

656
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,560
 I've read a few more of the things recommended but I haven't completely fallen for any of

657
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,120
 them but there is good stuff that might turn up on the ballot.

658
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
 My other recommendations are all novellas.

659
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,160
 Somehow I've read three novellas, none of which are from Tor.com which is unusual for

660
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
 me.

661
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
 I didn't even know that was possible.

662
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:14,440
 Oh yeah, well I read A Theory of Haunting by Sarah Monette which is in her series, the

663
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:21,400
 Kyle Murchison Booth series which I have read none of the rest of actually.

664
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,960
 But there are all kind of mysteries starring this Kyle Booth who is a kind of archivist

665
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,280
 and goes out to solve various mysteries and ghost stories.

666
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,720
 It's a ghost story in a haunted house but it's a good one.

667
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:42,080
 I'm also going to pick Walking Practice by Dolki Min as previously picked by me which is

668
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,360
 quite long so I'm worried it actually crosses over into a novel but I'm going to pick it

669
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
 for novella.

670
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,640
 And the last one I'm going to pick is called On the English Approach to the Study of History

671
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,560
 and I almost don't want to style what the English approach to the study of history is

672
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,160
 but it's basically a novella.

673
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,960
 It's a novella all about academic history which is performed in a certain way originating

674
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,680
 from Queens College, Cambridge.

675
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,760
 And so it's about kind of, you know, it's about academia, it's about hierarchies, it's

676
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,080
 about young women and non-white people and how they get along in academia.

677
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,560
 It's about kind of how the same methods get used over and over and people don't want

678
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,000
 to challenge them but it's also kind of a horror/ghost story.

679
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,400
 The whole thing does take place in a college where I spent an awful lot of time in an undergrad

680
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,680
 so that's probably why I like it but I still thought it was good.

681
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:42,320
 And that is by E Saxey and it was published in Giganotosaurus who I think generally have

682
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,160
 pretty good fiction until I might nominate them in Best Semiprozine as well.

683
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,920
 I vote all of those sound really interesting, I will look them up enthusiastically.

684
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,920
 Giga Notosaurus I think is a good shout for Best Semi-Prosean as is Strange Horizons.

685
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,920
 Which has been nominated 11 years in a row at this point and never won and gone very,

686
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
 very close.

687
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,440
 Vote for Strange Horizons.

688
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,720
 Yeah, it's probably about time to celebrate Strange Horizons, should be their year maybe.

689
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,720
 I have unsubscribed from Uncanny so I have not really read any short fiction this year.

690
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,400
 So I will be throwing myself on the mercy of people's recommendations.

691
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,120
 I mean I do think Naomi Kritzer’s The Year Without Sunshine from Uncanny is a dead cert

692
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
 in Novolette.

693
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
 Fair enough.

694
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,240
 Yeah so The Year Without Sunshine is a story about kind of communities coming together

695
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,520
 in the face of difficult times in Apocalypse and I think it will really, I don't know,

696
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,360
 I thought it was fine but I think it will really appeal to people who want that sort of story

697
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,280
 about having a sense of community and coming together and people working together to solve

698
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
 problems.

699
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,640
 Listen to Raj wrote in and recommended the year without Sunshine by Naomi Quits for Novelette.

700
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,040
 So thank you very much Raj.

701
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,080
 I mean do send us your recommendations guys.

702
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,200
 I am looking forward to seeing the ballot and then reading some short fiction.

703
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:07,840
Can we talk about novels before we run out of time?

704
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
 Yes.

705
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,800
 I read some novels.

706
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,600
 I didn't read many though.

707
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,240
 Liz read all the novels.

708
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,200
 Yeah I read a lot apparently.

709
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,280
 I was going to do some last minute novel reading and I solicited some opinions on what might

710
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,920
 be good to read from various people and then when I went to look at them on Goodreads to

711
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,880
 see whether Alison or Liz had read them.

712
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,880
 Alison and Liz had read all of them except one so I started reading the one that they

713
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,880
 hadn’t

714
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,320
 Alison or Liz because there's no way I'd read all of them.

715
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,120
 That you haven't read all of them but there are a few where Liz hadn't and you had.

716
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,440
 So between you you are quite good on 2023 fiction.

717
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,640
 Well done both.

718
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
 Yeah.

719
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,000
 Right well I started doing some emergency reading for this podcast and I was going to

720
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,800
 read Julia by Sandra Newman which is a book that a lot of people have talked about who

721
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,960
 are not necessarily in our regular thing.

722
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,400
 It is a book that is in conversation as they say with 1984 by George Orwell and I read the

723
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,320
 first eight pages and thought oh shit I need to go and read 1984 by George Orwell so I'm

724
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,600
 just here to tell you that's quite a good book that holds up way better than you might

725
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,920
 think it does but is perhaps not eligible for the Hugo.

726
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,560
 So Julia is an interesting novel but I'm only halfway through it.

727
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:23,280
 I think it's probably not as good as it thinks it is but I think there is plenty of space

728
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,000
 to think about some of the other characters who exist in the space of 1984 and what's

729
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,840
 going on in their lives and that is what Sandra Newman has tried to do here whilst also saying

730
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,280
 something quite interesting about the philosophy and the kind of meta story of 1984 which is

731
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,880
 always of course a huge thing but I'm not sure it entirely succeeds as an all but I think

732
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,400
 it is a shout.

733
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,960
 I have not read Hopeland but if I had a pound for everybody who had told me that Hopeland

734
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:56,400
 by Ian McDonald is the best novel of the year I would have had enough for about 20% of

735
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,840
 the money I spent in games shop yesterday and I think I would love to see Ian on the

736
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,280
 ballot at a Glasgow Worldcon so. 

737
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,440
 Everyone should nominate Hopeland.

738
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,560
 That's outrageous whether it's good or not but I hope it is and I will definitely read

739
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,080
 it before nominations come around.

740
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,640
 I have read Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh and I picked it as a former pick and

741
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,880
 I think it is quite a good book and I have read The Saint of Bright Doors which is not a book

742
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,160
 like any book I've ever read before and I think that is quite an interesting book but

743
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:32,200
 I kind of slightly like it a little bit less once I learnt just how much the amazing central

744
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:40,400
 city is just Colombo and just how much it borrows very directly from a major creation

745
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,880
 myth of Buddhism but I think probably it is still pretty good and that is a very interesting

746
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,880
 book.

747
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,840
 I think that's probably about all of the ones that I have come to my attention that aren't

748
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,360
 all but also going to be on Liz's list.

749
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,960
 And indeed some of those are on my list.

750
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,640
 Alright, I'd like to see Him by Geoff Ryman on the ballot as well and that's another one

751
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,000
 that I have to confess I haven't actually read.

752
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,880
 People who have read it tell us me tell me it's very very good but this will be a good

753
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,920
 year to get some excellent British novelists on the list guys let's do that.

754
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:17,240
 I'm going to pick some books that I have read and also weren't published many years ago

755
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,400
 because I think that's probably a good starting point.

756
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,000
 Yeah I was about to say only Alison when I asked what should we read from 2023 could

757
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,840
 go on a digression about 1984.

758
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,360
 Sorry guys.

759
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,600
 So I am probably picking some desperate glory.

760
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,080
 I'm in the middle of the Saint of Bright Doors and unless it's terrible in the last half

761
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,160
 then I'm probably picking that as well.

762
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:47,800
 My other possibilities are Cahokia Jazz by Francis Spufford which is an alternate history kind of

763
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,360
 20s noir.

764
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:57,300
 So it's basically the setting is that it's the 1920s and there is still like a huge native

765
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,720
 American population that is thriving and has not been completely wiped out and they have

766
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:10,480
 this city state called Cahokia which is home to a mix of Native Americans, African Americans

767
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:17,160
 and Europeans and it's about a murder that is investigated by Native American who was

768
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:23,880
 fostered as a child and so he does not speak the local language and his European partner

769
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,720
 and he gets entangled with the politics of the city.

770
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,120
 Yeah and I really liked it.

771
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:35,760
 The closest thing to it is, sorry I can't remember the name of the book it is closest

772
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,760
 to.

773
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,760
 Oh, The Yiddish Policeman's Union.

774
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,080
 So it feels a lot like The Yiddish Policeman's Union in that it has kind of a murder mystery

775
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:48,120
 and the main thing is that it is set in this alternate United States.

776
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,360
 So it did feel a bit like that but in a really good way. I like The Yiddish Policeman's Union

777
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,200
 but it's not maybe quite core genre in that way.

778
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:02,120
 What am I going to nominate? I'm thinking about In Ascension by Martin Macinnes which is this

779
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:11,720
 really nicely written book about going into space and investigating a mysterious signal.

780
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,040
 Yeah and it's kind of about this, I'm trying to say how I should want to say about this.

781
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:21,040
 It's kind of about a protagonist who has kind of thrown herself into sort of marine biology

782
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,520
 and the study of that in a way to get away from the difficult family relationship she

783
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:32,720
 has and she ends up kind of deciding she's going to go to the stars.

784
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,400
 And I read this quite a while ago but I really enjoyed it.

785
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,800
 What else am I thinking of nominating?

786
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,960
 Basically then I've got like an extra slot or maybe an extra two slots that might contain

787
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,480
 City of Last Chances as mentioned on this podcast previously.

788
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,840
 The Reformatory has recommended a couple of episodes ago by me, Titanium Noir as recommended

789
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:57,600
 by me probably a few episodes ago and Our Share of Night by Marianna Henriquet.

790
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,120
 I'm not sure if this is actually 2023 or 2022 because it's a translation of an earlier

791
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:08,920
 novel but that is sort of a very long novel about people with sort of supernatural powers

792
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,800
 and investigating the kind of other worlds set in 1980s Argentina.

793
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,280
 According to Kobo that's 2022.

794
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,280
 Yes but I think it might be 2023 in the US.

795
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,280
 Ah hah.

796
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,840
 Which I guess counts.

797
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,680
 This is the last year, this is the last year it does count but it would this year yes.

798
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,240
 Well we'll get into that again when I've bothered reading that one.

799
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,360
 Yes you are right it is eligible through the US publication.

800
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,920
 But I think it sounds very little chance of being on the ballot and but then it feels

801
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:48,080
 like 700 pages and quite dense so I don't think it stands a chance then either.

802
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,080
 I read I can't remember how much I've read this eligible.

803
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:58,920
 I'm told by my learned co-host Liz that the City of Last Chances is eligible because it

804
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,400
 was only published in the US in 2023.

805
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:09,240
 What I will say is that the Hugo spreadsheet of doom has the sequel House of Open Wounds

806
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,400
 on it instead.

807
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,080
 So I wonder whether that is the one that people will get behind.

808
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:20,160
 But I will read House of Open Wounds before the nominations close and I will probably

809
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,400
 nominate both if they're eligible because I love Adrian's Tchaikovsky novels.

810
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,480
 The book I have started to read but not finished I'm about halfway through I was hoping I would

811
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,520
 tear through it and it turns out it's an incredibly difficult book to tear through because it

812
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:41,760
 deals with loads of like hard stuff is Bridge by Lauren Beukes which is about there is a

813
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:47,080
 woman and her mother dies and she has to go through her mother's stuff.

814
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,800
 So it's probably maybe content warnings for anyone who's had to recently go through that.

815
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,520
 Trigger, trigger warning.

816
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,520
 Yeah.

817
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:01,280
 And she has a memory that when she was young her mother used to take drugs and let her

818
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,480
 take drugs and go to parallel dimensions and her therapist has worked on this with her

819
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,120
 and explained how this is probably a false memory that's repressing something.

820
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,840
 But since I'm really.

821
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,720
 But this is a Lauren Beukes novel.

822
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:18,320
 So since I am recommending it on the Octothorpe podcast one may be able to discern that this

823
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,600
 perhaps might not be the case.

824
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:28,240
 Part of the reason it's so difficult is because large parts of it deal with like if you're

825
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:35,040
 doing a thing that to someone else sounds absolutely insane how do they process that

826
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,280
 and how do you process your grief and if you're doing this while you're processing

827
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:46,120
 that grief does that make it look worse to the exterior person and why did your mother

828
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:53,400
 not talk to you more and there's a lot of really really hard stuff in there.

829
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,480
 But I am really enjoying it so far about halfway through.

830
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:03,480
 So if it doesn't completely screw the landing I would confidently recommend it and like anyone

831
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,040
 who's read Beukes’ previous novels like it it seems up there with all of them maybe

832
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
 even better.

833
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,040
 So yes I am.

834
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,880
 I haven't finished it yet so you know the last half might be rubbish but I strongly

835
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,640
 suspect it won't be and I might pick it properly once I've actually finished it.

836
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,080
 Sounds quite scary.

837
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,080
 It's really good.

838
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:27,060
 I'm not sure I would recommend you read it because of how it might be quite triggering.

839
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:34,320
 He also heard from listener Raj who recommended some books we haven't covered.

840
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,800
 Well we covered translation states in best series but Raj recommends that for novel.

841
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:45,360
 He also recommends Meru by S.B. Divya, Descendant Machine by Gareth L. Powell, Starter Villain and

842
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,400
 by John Scalzi and Book Shops and Bone Dust by Travis Baldry.

843
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,320
 I'll be astounded if that latter isn't on the ballot.

844
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:59,380
 I wrote to Niall Harrison to ask what he would nominate and most of his picks are ones that

845
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:05,580
 have already come up as Liz and Alison have been talking but his favourite five books did

846
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:10,740
 include Orbital by Samantha Harvey which we did not yet mention and which he really

847
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,740
 enjoyed.

848
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:18,180
 I wrote to Abigail Nussbaum to ask her for her opinions and she recommended The Terraformers

849
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:24,060
 by Annalie Newitz and The Mad Sisters of Esi by Tashan Mehta both of which we didn't

850
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,600
 mention and also recommended some others that we did.

851
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,500
 I also wrote to Graham Sleight and he recommended some we haven't mentioned so he recommended

852
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,580
 Conquest by Nina Allen, Biography of X by Catherine Lacey, Prophet by Helen McDonald and Sin

853
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:45,340
 Blasheh, Dryland by B. Pladek who we mentioned in short story and Airside by Christopher Priest.

854
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:50,260
 So this is the last chance to get a Christopher Priest book onto the Hugo Ballot for a UK

855
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,700
 Worldcon, possibly our greatest British science fiction author, just saying.

856
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,140
 I will definitely read it before nominations close.

857
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:03,260
 Graham excerpted his picks from a Locus article so that was very handy because I can just

858
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,860
 link you all to the locus article where he talks to that topic.

859
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,820
 That was it, that's all of it, not bad.

860
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,220
 Shall we do picks?

861
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,220
 No.

862
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,540
 And that was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye from me, it's goodbye from me.

863
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:40,900
 And it's goodbye from me.

864
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:48,860
 So when I go to, oh this is a clone of eFanzines that I've found through Google, how strange.

865
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,980
 That is weird.

866
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:57,060
 I just saw that the URL was not actually eFanzines.com and that'll be why.

867
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,420
 Fair enough, okay good.

868
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,260
 Yeah so what you want is eFanzines.com/idea.

869
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,500
 Some sort of weird bootleg eFanzines, why?

870
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,100
 Yeah I know, it's bizarre, oh yes, cool.

871
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:14,740

 This podcast will end at the beep.

874
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,020
 Beep.

875
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:45,140
 [silence]
